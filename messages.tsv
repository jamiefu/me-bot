You	Me
Awesome, thanks!	hey adit brendan told me that u did smurf after your freshman year i'm thinking of applying this year could you tell me a little bit about it by any chance?
Hey! Yeah I did SMURF and loved it Happy to answer any questions	oh awesome um yeah so what irg were u in and what project did you do and like could you like walk through a typical week while you were there
I was in IC My project was kinda whack I just had to make an analytics dashboard and website So I did 5 weekend trips total And on those weeks id go to work from mon-thurs And on Thurs we'd bring a backpack with weekend clothes to work And straight after work go to the airport and fly to a neighboring country like Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia etc And we'd just rent out an Airbnb there and go do whatever was fun in that country Also Wednesday nights are called ladies night in Singapore and women drink for free at bars/clubs So our group would go and the girls would get drinks and pass them off to the guys so we could all drink for free haha SMURF also does a lot of stuff while you're there so throughout the summer they'll take you sightseeing in Singapore and things like that And take you to some really nice restaurants Tbh I think it was the most fun I've had in my life so far but I've heard that it's kinda dependent on who else is in your cohort In terms of the actual work, I wish I'd done FM instead (future mobility)	Oh wait is this still an irg our 4 I think are slightly different now Is this considered like standard
My year was the only year they had IC	Oh huh
Cause the issue is that IC didn't have actual research for us Cause IC is the department that helps research spin out into startups	Do u end up spending a lot of time w people in your cohort since everybody is like Probably in different labs Ohhh i see
Yeah Cause of weekend trips And you're all living in the same place	I think I'm applying for this one Oh that's awesome Is it like they have an apartment complex that u all live in
Idk if you've heard about SMURF housing but it's actually insane	No I haven't
It's called a service apartment So like a long term hotel Lemme see if I can find photos tho	Lol OK thanks adit
This is where you live	Oh what the fuck That's a resort
This is where you work Hahaha yeah It's in Singapore's richest area I think	Brooo
Like I was there during the trump-kim summit And trump's hotel was a 5 min walk And Kim Jong un's hotel was a 3 min walo	Lmaoo
The street next to it is filled with Rolex and Louis Vuitton stores Idk if this is true but I've heard the housing is $8000	I don't think I saw it on the website but how is the stipend
It's like MISTI but a lot better	Also do most labs just have u work mon-thur
So everything is paid for	Like food housing too?
Like housing and travel You can get a lot of free meals They give you $2100 for food Which is a LOT more than you need	Oh okay I see yeah OK lmao
Cause you can get a meal for like $3 And then pay you $15/hour iirc I was able to do all the weekend trips and feed myself with the $2100 stipend	Yeah cuz like everything is so close so u just like Fly wherever right
Yeah exactly Also if you have extra money on their flight stipend ($2100) which I did You can get a free trip on your way back So like my roommates and I went to Japan for a week after SMURF ended	Lmao damn what the heck Y'all just Having a good time OK that sounds awesome One last q how much work  experience do u think u got out of it and how beneficial was it towards like Future internships and stuff
So In my IRG's case it wasn't a super big boost I'd say it's the same as a UROP If you're in an intense project then it'd look pretty good But also imo people worry a bit too much about intensity of freshman year experience Even tho it stops mattering kinda quickly For CS*	Oh hmm OK I think I'll try to apply regardless Thanks for answering my questions adit!
np!	hey adit for smurf did you ever get in touch with any of the investigators or mentors for smurf before u went? and do u remember around what month u heard back from them?
Uh yeah I think the person in charge of the project has to approve you before you can apply Or at least that's how it was when I applied	oh what it's definitely not like that now do you think i should still reach out and express interest i just had to write down the investigator and mentor names on the app but that's about it
Oh interesting Yeah people did interviews with the investigator before even applying haha Yeah it can't hurt ig Although if they took that requirement out I'd reach out with some set of questions So that it doesn't seem unnecessary	hmm ok that sounds like a good idea the website also doesn't have like a notification date when should i expect to hear back
I heard back on Feb 23rd So I'd estimate late February	ohhhh that's a pretty quick turnaround ok awesome thanks adit i just submitted my app today lol so i was thinking about what i should do next
Hahaha relatable Good luck :)	:pp thanks adit ehe
hey are you free rq? I'm trying to debug lab 1 for 004 and don't know what I'm doing wrong 	Haha lmao give me a few minutes Do u want to send me a screenshot of your code
sure one sec	uh do u have a swapped variable it doesn't look like you're setting anything to swapped true when u perform a swap
Like a temp holder? Oh the Boolean?	like the while loop should only occur is swapped is true yeah the boolean
No is that necessary?	yes to perform the correct number of iterations
Can I just do n while loop iterations O	uh not really yeah while should perform only when swapped is true and for should always start from 0 to n-1
Ok I'll fix that	but n-1 goes down by one for every loop you perform in while that's just an optimizatino tho
ohhh I forgot to reset my pointer to the start of the array for each while loop idk if that's the issue but probably doesn't help haha ty okay so I changed it so that it should only do 0 to n-1 and to only do a while loop if there was a swap but I'm still failing all the test cases :'( btw please don't worry about this if you're busy	well u seem to be branching to smth called whiletest are the test cases not throwing u errors at specific lines are u able to run make successfully
yeah I just used whiletest as a place to check if swapped=0 or 1 yeah make works and no it's just outputting the wrong answer	you're doing beqz a2, done which i think is incorrect? you should only ever branch to done when u iterate through all the values of your sub array and discover that swapped is still false at the end of it i also don't think you're decrementing n by 1 with every while loop u run which is minor but maybe the TAs have the test cases checking it
since I assign a3 (originally n) to be a2 and do addi a2,a2,-1 doesn't that decrement n by 1 with every while loop? also it caused an infinite loop when I took out the beqz a2, done li is basically an assignment statement right? even if something has already been initialized?	thnk u need to do the mv a3, a2 after u do the subtraction also the a2 thing tells me that it's exiting the loop only when a2 is zero not when swapped is false also i think you're checking when swapped is false at the wrong location you only check after you run the entire for loop from 0 to n-1 but it looks like you're doing that when a swap does not occur so this seems a bit sketch too i think these are the main problems i can see there's probably some one off errors in there too but i would just set a break point and user rv_sim_gui & to step through your function usuallyt he breakpoint is at 0x38
ok I'll do that thanks for the help!	yee lmk if you have any other questions i think the hard part about assembly is that the code runs like in a very linear fashion so the branching isn't intuitively the same as writing loops in python when i took the class they were like yeah if u think about this like python u won't do well but also it helps if u try to follow the commands from the python code exactly and structure your labels (like while: and loop:) such that they follow the checks and ops closely
omg changing the mv a3, a2 thing to after I subtracted fixed it you're the best	LOL nice hey adit did isaac ever reach out to you about getting in touch with mtc and bill aulet
Hey, yeah he did I’m waiting for your headshots to put on the medium article to send them I think Christina is pretty much done	oh like this semester's headshots? i think i sent u mine with my blurb do u know if he set up a meeting or smth i don't want to overlap with what he's doing and set up another meeting with bill if i don't need to
Yeah but the issue is that there was a lot of variation in the headshots that people sent so it looked bad Yeah last year he set up a meeting After the new management email was sent	oh hmm so should i need to set up a meeting with bill to talk about funding
So here’s what I would do After the medium article is up, have the entire management team meet with bill, Greg, Brian, and frosh Trish Spend the first 40 min just talking and getting to know him And then towards the end mention the need to find sponsors and ask if they can help	ok sure who is greg and brian
Marketing and logistics person for MTC	OK I see thanks adit
hi quick q for the benchmark part of the lab I can get it to still work and to print one of the two performance counters but I can't get it to do both??	um you're not pringint anything rn i think that's the debugging help the staff made it so you can check what you're printing against the instructions it found in your performance counter /instruction counter
Yeah I just realized that the implementation automatically calls sort instead of just the function at the top haha	lol yes that is what it does
uhhh so the performance counter is only supposed to print once right cause mine just keeps printing these two over and over now the 156927 value stays the same and the 82___ increases every time	that's because it's recursive yep so you need to built a wrapper so the 150000 value is partition and the stuff in between with 82 is your instruction counter make a wrapper so it only prints once
yeah so I made a new function called sort and then renamed the old function to be quicksort	yep so when are you printing
in the wrapper after I call quicksort and the only other thing I changed from my quick sort function is that I start/stop the performance counter before calling partition	you're probably not chaging your recursive calls within your new quicksort to be call quicksort
also if you're trying to sleep/do other work pls dw about this I can go to OH tomorrow	it's all good i was about to sleep soon i gave up on my work uh if u already remade your file then the other thing is that possibly u need to store your ra before calling quicksort if it's an infinite loop and never stops this is likey the issue
ohhh	yeah if that doesn't work i'm in oh tmrw from 1-3 and that's usually when miles is there too he's our head UTA so he's p good
ok tysm for the help!	yeppp
ok adding that in fixed it I think thanks again	Yea np
hey quick Q im passing test cases locally for a function but on Didit it throws a compilation error do you know what this is caused by or should I post on piazza?	which function is it
multiply by adding	ik this is trivial but have u checked your git log and commit history to make sure didit is checking your most recent push
yeah so I've only done 1 commit so far where I answered a discussion q + added this function and it gave me points for the discussion q	alright i'm looking at it now
ok ty!	can u show me the output from make multiply_by_adding_test when u run it
yup one sec	have you made any changes to the entire file other to that function didit might be trying to compile the entire file rather than just calling the func
no or at least not intentionally lemme see if I accidentally backspaced another func or something yeah afaik that's the only thing that's changed	after you're done checking can u try to make a trivial change, commit and push to the server. if it still fails i'll ask in our slack channel and ask a ta
okay yeah it works now ty!	yeah nice np isn't this thing due tmrw lol
LMAOOO that chem group chat was peak comedy	there was just like 10 of these in a row
the kabir one is literally the greatest thing I've ever seen in my life	literally my sense of humor hasn't matured at all i saw that and i was like holy i got flamed
"my sense of humor has regressed I""m not capable of those masterpieces anymore"	it was good while it lasted wait r u in ross too advay can't remember
nah	oh okay lol cuz your profile pic looks very rossy
LOL i mean it was taken in ross but almost everyone takes professional headshots in ross bc it looks nice	i actually havent' seen that much of campus but i think law quad always looks super nice the library looks like straight outta hogwarts
Yeah some spots are super photogenic	what r u up to this summer
Eh nm rn Just chilling till my internship starts wbu	Oh when does it start I'm just uroping this summer so it's not been so bad so far
Did you go? I just got out of my meeting lol	Yessor
Dang I think I came too late by the time I would've gotten skates it would've been over	Boooo No the line is super short rn U can do ot
ripppoo i already left!!! let's go skating some other time, i promised my other friend i would go with her i kinda just stood on the rink and chatted with people for a while LOL	Aight I'm down
yo do you have plans for iap this yr?	I'm working at Microsoft down on memorial drive wbu
wowow that's so cool! externship life oh the reason i ask is because i'm running web.lab (which is MIT's iap web development class) and we're looking for people to be on exec for iap! but sounds like you already have plans ^_^	Lmao shit that's so cool aactually
Yaaaa it's ok at least you're on campus though I'll still get to see you around	Wait low-key tho if there's like any way I can like just learn or do smth related I'd be so down Yeah definitely
Haha yah it depends on how intense Microsoft is Which externship are you doing? They have a bunch right	Oh true lol It's intune engineering with their research center
:ooo that seems pretty involved	Haha okay yeah maybe not then but u should definitely tell me all about it
I will! Iap on campus is so fun you're gonna love it	Yay that's good I'm excoted yo alex do u know if there's still practice today
Neeraj says he'll figure it out apparently Lol	lol so *maybe
I think maybe is the correct answer ya Wish you were here in north carolina with us!	oh shit you're in north carolina that's right brooo good luck
Thaaaaanks It's a mood there are so many teams here	must be exciting is it warm it'll be fun dw keep me updated!
I will!! It's kinda cold actually it was low 40s this morning We're 1-1, got edged out by Cornell by a tiny bit	oh wait it's definitely warmer over here then but super windy lol aw but still means u guys can beat them right

Are you going to prac tn?	Maybe I am lacking currently In willpower
Looool Ahhh yeah I get I get it w/ out me practice isn't lit	Omfg Whatever u say alex
Lmaooo I see you reacting with the Chad flag in slack Somehow Neeraj has made this a *thing* over this weekend	wait I LITERALLY DONT EVEN KNOW WHAT IT MEANS someone else just reacted with it so i just hit it too i don't even understand it
It's ok I'm pretty sure no one here knows what Chad actually means people are just calling everything Chad LOL Did you end up going to practice?? :D we're coming back tmr!!	omg okay okay YES SIR I DID i went on FRIDAY AND SUNDAY ARE U PROUD also how'd u play at toc
SO PROUD I played ok!!! Could've played better in the final I need to train! Train me	yeah i feel like this is not a valid thing to ask of me because i suck ass meh you win some you lose some it be like that sometimes did u have fun is the important question ok good this is my sole source of motivation
I did have fun!! This wknd was wild Some of these teams go super hard I swear half of the kids on Sunday were hungover	wait what at a tennis tournament lol??? wait jupneet told me u came to practice hammered once tho
Omfg I did not	"so i guess u shouldn't even say anything ""omfg i did not"""
She mixed me up with Barksdale HAHAHAHA	wait r u sure
IT'S THE OTHER ALEX	OMG
Ya I hit with him that day	okay wait who is other alex
Man was drunk as a skunk Love him to death though	i think he may have came to practice today but i don't really know not sure and he told me his name before so i didn't want to ask agian lmaoo
Hahaha yeah he's kinda stocky? Like we do *not* look similar	LOL ok fair enough
Lmao yeah classic	what do skunks have to do with this
But Neeraj went pretty ham last night You're right this figure of speech is not a great one	oh man lol
But twas fun	i have a serious question tho why does he wear cargo pants and high socks
HAHAHAHA	to tennis and then he goes so hard during practice like how hasn't he ripped his pants yet
Wait I'm pretty sure they're like actually sweatpant material Or some of them at least	okay that's a little better
He does have a pair of pants that are ripped in the butt though Prime location	because i feel very confused
He's wearing them rn actually	the ONLY location
LOL	lmaooo it's iconic
What a guy Btw are you coming this sat? :D	to the party? sir i am a freshmen on p/nr who cares too much about school to go to this party
noooOOOOOOOO im a sad potato come! it'll be fun! how do i convince you	aren't we all idrk where is it you guys are going to be drunk as skunks to put it in your words
LOL that's definitely not true!! i don't drink very much and i doubt >= 50% of people will drink at this party	mehhhh i have like two midterms the next week tho
hahaha that's fair well if there's ANY way i can convince you let me know which midterms? :)	will do 042 and 004 big sad
dang big rip it's okkkkk PNR is so good	Yeah agree Thankful for the remaining 2 months It'll be sad next semester Unless u TA 006 Ig
fingers crossed!! that's why you should spend this sem having fun :DDDD	Did u spend your first semester having fun
To some extent! I worked really hard after my freshman year And I wish I had been more chill my first semester	Haha but u see the syndrome is unavoidable I feel like I don't want to fall into the trap of being too relaxed and not knowing how to manage my time off pnr Like I should how to do it now right
That's entirely fair	OK wait u act like I'm a hermit I'm not I promise Only a little bit
LOL I'm sure you're not To be honest I was super try hard Sophomore year I like Was 100% a hermit But good grades are pretty useless in course 6 I've found, they haven't been too useful to me Wish I spent more time with friendos in hindsight	Wait I am super try hard oh no I hope I won't be Yeah that's fair but I can't help but want good grades I feel like I'm getting over the whole like Perfectionist thing tho Honestly I'm already over it lmao I'm so lazy for some things lol Damn I feel that
Omg yeah I 100 percent feel Like even now, I'm still being a try hard even though my grades are like I think it's a pride thing hahaha Like feeling confident that I can do well	OK technically there's nothing with being a try hard unless it significantly ruins your life right Yeah like I'm always like damn I know I didn't try a lot on this But I could've done better
Mmm yeah I think college is pretty special though That's why I'm trying to prioritize like Hanging out with people	This is wholesome Positive vibes only Lmao Okay but actually tho Once I get the feel for colleging I will try to do this too This is definitely important
Hang out with me Jamie!!!	Okay Alex!!!!
042 is a time though And so is 004 lmao	Thank u For reassuring me That I will be ok
You have so much time tho!! :D	Lol in comparison to how much time I'll have in the future I should be takinf more advantage of the time I have now shouldn't i Meh Whatever Okay I feel like this is an appropriate bedtime I'm going to knock out now Please sleep soon As well
Knock out! Ya Im also sleeping soon I'll see you later this wk :)	Yes but not Wednesday because I have a 009 quiz
Holy okay gl	Haha thanks OK gn You sent an attachment. Still don't get the meme but here ya go
LOLLL Amazing This is the high quality content I live for Just landed back in Bos!!	Excellent Nice u should get some rest
Dinner first I'm so hungry During dinner last night we had a waiter named Chad Highlight of the week What a guy	That's good timing Or bad timing
LOL Z	Depending how u think of it
Word Yeah I think I'm just hungry How goes 009 studying	oh yeah u should probably eat it does not go sir it does not go at all lol no i took a practice quiz earlier today and it was mostly meh whatever i'm mostly just lacking motivation
Mood 009 confuses me Like the quizzes Usually you don't have quizzes for like practical classes	yeah i'm really confused as to what i should study so i think the plan is to just do some practice quesitons i just got distracted though by some internship app i forgot about earlier today so now i'm applying for a job lmao
Oh yoooo wyd this summer have you decided	no i have no plans yet i want to get a job but it's all up in the air i would love to do a misti but they seem pretty competitive and i don't have any languages under my belt unless u count my *bilingual speaking mandarin proficiency
Mood Are you applying anywhere	i'm submitting my resume to a lot of places yeah idrk where to look though like i feel like a big portion of them are just like long shots but ig idrk where else to look
Mmm that's fair	:pp i'm just browsing lol shooting my shot and missing but shooting regardless
It's ok it'll get easier after 006 :D I'm finally home!!	ideally yes i hope so yayyy
I'm so tired of tennis lmao So much tennis this past wknd :oooo	Haha no u can't be u love tennis remember OK but I would be too lol
I am going to just be a human potato for the forseeable future	this sounds like a excellent plan i vibe with that
okie i think im gonna sleep early and try to make up sleep from this weekend lmao gl not studyinggg	lol that makes sense okay thank u very much for the support HAPPY BIRTHDAY ALEX popped my head into my google calendar and saw how does it feel to be even older than old
Hehe hi!! Omg stop Still early 20s Thanks for the wishes <3	You're very welcome :))
Are you going home for break?	Sir you've asked the right question I am in fact already home
Ooooh fun :D	I flew back last Friday and I'm not going back until sat morn Skipping class is okright
Omg LOL that's why I haven't seen you at prac!!	Ohhh yeep
Lol I support	Its cuz I'm chilling in michigan I do miss practice tho Wanted to go but Ce nest pas possible
Wow French bougie That's great you're home for holidays :)	Yeah can u tell I took 3 years of French in high school 8m that good Yeah its nice to be home Wbu Any plans to go back?
I'm flying home tmr!!! Gotta pack tonight Spending my bday on a spirit airlines flight Jooooyful	Aww I wish u safe travels then But u can celebrate belated w the fam So that'll be nice Also I have to get up early tmrw So I am going to knock out now Gn!!! ????? r u teaching????
LOL omg TAs were talking about this yeah ill probably help out but ill mostly be doing weblab lol	did the TAs decide to do this or was it someone else
are you trynna get ahead :P	oh right web.lab is pretty big well yeah it's in the evenings so that's p dope and i'm trying to fit in 6.08 next semester too
holy how many classes	"so if ik 6.006 decently it'll be an ok time ok so i'm realistically dropping 6.08 even tho i'm pre-reg for it but it's 11.011 (negotiation/hass) or 9.00
6.006
6.036
6.08?
8.02 9.00 is also a hass"
dang 9.00 was actually a reasonable amount of work	oh shoot uhhhh idk what to do then probably just drop 6.08 it's aight taking 6.006 over iap or listening or whatever will still be interesting and i'm probably fucked in 036 anyways so it'll just take off some of the load hopefully
LOL you'll be ok!! Wow next semester will be fun we can pset 006 together :^)	"smh alex ""pset together"" that's not what it's acutlaly going to be it will be u in office hours helping out"
lol	my sorry ass
006 OH is a shitshow dude	there is a DIFFERENCE
it always is	:((( big sad
be in my recitation!!!! ill lyk about 006 over iap when i hear more about it i haven't been in the loop :P	"I""LL TRY when will u know what hours you're teaching do we decide recitation periods after class starts or before"
lol not until like next sem i think we know like right before class starts	ok well 8.02 lecture is kind of a time sink so no guarantees
That's true	hey alex do u know anybody that knows like web dev things that would be willing to teach for blueprint (feb. 8-9)? ik that web.lab is like busy but i was thinking u might know somebody
hey! I'll pass along the word to weblab ppl are you running blue print??? i thought you were hack :o	haha yeah hack does hackmit and blueprint :)) oh wait no i think we already asked web.lab though and they collectively like responded that they didn't want to? i think
Oh lmao what Well Individual ppl might still be interested I might be interested!!!	Yeassssass OK wait just lmk
Okie!! Would it be teaching a workshop Or is it like just helping	"I think teaching but any help is appreciated :)) I'm checking w jack rn ok yeah i'm pretty sure it's workshop and jack says the more people the better so u and anybody else u know would be super duper lit ""yeah we need a teacher for frontend web dev and backend web dev"" he says"
what would teaching include? just a workshop? like how long	yes a workshop um let me see if i can find the schedule
ok!	feb 8
that sounds like a lot of fun! im tentatively interested	yay coooool :))) hey alex how goes winter break :)) jack texted me today asking whether you're still interested in mentoring or hosting a workshop for blueprint so i thought i'd check in w u on that stuff :p
yeah! I'd be interested! it's later in the spring right	uhhhh
winter break is good! hope your holidays are going well ^___^	it's the first weekend of february
oh wao soon :O	yayyyy that's good
what date?	yeah it's coming up feb 8th and the 9th too if u can i went to vegas for a week yeah i've been feeling kind of busy running around there tho finally got home the last few days and had a chance to sleep 12 hours and lay around in my pjs all day
hah love it that's what the holidays are for yeah sure I'm down to teach a FE workshop at blueprint do you guys have preferences for what it each teach*	omg yayyy ily imma check with jack rn bro i'm enjoying it so much
Isn’t it cold af in Michigan Lol	"BRO IT HAS BARELY SNOWED AND I""M SHOOK i think it's kind of going to be awful here jan-mar though winter has been weird lately"
It’s k you won’t be there lol	it's still cold tho well yes that's fair leave my family to suffer
I’m so excited for iap It’ll be so hype	brooo all 3 of my roommmates are gone for iap imma be hella lonely oh btw there's 4 sessions for the same workshop on the 8th will u be able to be there like whole day or should we find some other people? jack also said you could do it with friends or smth too if that's easier. the schedule is like 1 before lunch, 1 after, then tech talk break, the 2 after that or smth and it'll mostly be html/css stuff won't have a lot of coding experience
4 sessions of the same workshop? Like 4 repeats or four chunks	4 repeats
Oh woah Why not all at once Just too many kids?	yeah i think so
Gotcha Hmmm ok so just html css? It’s a hackathon right Oh wtf Oops Fuck idk how to use iOS yet	WAIT ALEX I WAS WRONG it's one workshop in 4 different chunks
Ah ok	SORRY yes pretty much ok so like for blueprint the kids choose a track and the entire first day is like a learnathon for them to learn smth in that trak in your case frontend web dev and then the next day they try to build something with what they learned these are really good stickers btw
Bun!!!!	yussss wait what did u switch phones
Yeah lol	also were u thinking of doing the workshops with anyone it'll be around 60 high schoolers total with you for all 4 sessions there will be mentors to help out tho
That’s probably fine As long as I have a big enough room Also it’s a hackathon We should probably teach us	yee it's in stats stata
Js***	up to you sir :))
Are you gonna be there :D	ummm and jack said u should probably have something to show on a projector doesn't need to be like lecture slides or anything but like smth to show yah boiiiiii should i try to be a mentor for the frontend workshops then all of hackdev will be mentors btw
Yes!!! Hang out with me Yeah I can make slides and stuff	yayy ok i'll try cool lmk if u have any questions or anything i can do :))
Ok! We have courts Friday and Sunday Just saw your msg	Oh cool Wait what time r the courts
ummm i think it's in slack lemme look 7-9 Friday 8-10 sunday	oh okay cool thanksss Practice today????
I cantttt I’m so hosed with web lab We have hackathon tonight	Oh right I bet
How you how’s iap	When r u gonna go to practice then????? Web.lab hackathin?? Me is good and iap is aight so far I got back from work like 10 minutes ago lol
Oh man How’s work Being employed, what a concept	I spent the entire day trying to run a process and failing in many creative and new ways I didn't write any code to improve this process yet Which is My job Same you're right it is an absolute concept
Loool mood Where do you work again Is it a long commute	Microsoft 5 min bike ride 20 min walk
In this cold? Woman u crazy	WAIT ACTUALLY ITS BEEN SO COLD REXENTLY Not good I didn't have gloves so my hands have been sort of freezing I'm borrowing my friends for next week tho I learned my lesson The bike is staying tho I don't have the patience for 20 min walks anymore
Hiiii What’s the schedule for blueprint? ^__^ Do I have complete freedom on what to cover	 here it is sir you're the workshop # stuff yes you basically do but try to make it really easy
All 4? Am I the only workshop?	like basic html css stuff ml
Yup	so like the kids get divided/choose their tracks and all day they only go to workshops in those tracks
Ahhhh got it	so there's web dev, start hacking, arduino, and backend
Backend? What does that mean Should I teach them how to deploy	bro i literally have no clue either
Or no	uhhhhh i don't think u need to
Lmao I’m assuming they mean web backend Which is interesting You might want to ask :o	as long as they can see their work on a browser tab or smththey don't need to deploy it anywhere good idea lol i asked and we await a response
Ok sg Ok!!! I’ll probably do one each of html css js	wdym by one each
Like one workshop of each And then last one... idk lol Maybe web design??	Ohhhhhh yeah thats a really good idea Oooh I'm so excited
Will you be there :D	Ill be at blueprint but alas I'll be helping out the arduino workshop They needed more people for that one and me and another girl were taking 6.08 next term so
Wtfffff sad I am saaaaddddd	Broo
Brooooooo	I'm sad too
Rip	It's OK it's still gonna be a good time!!!!! And I'll come visit you in between
Okieee	You have literally not been to tennis all of iap tho So I guess
Rhis is true Omg	I just will neber See u
Weblab has been so busy	Until Blueprint Lol OK fine yeah I agree
You should do it sometime it’s so fun	My friend Ben is taking the class and he's ALWAYS working on web lab It really sounds interesting tho
Yah!!! hihi friend wanna put me in touch with the person in charge of blueprint	Yeee Let me get his fb profile
you can make a gc with the three of us if that's easiest	Oh facts Hey do u know what recitation section you're teaching yet
R04 and R06!!	Does this mean Thursday 4pm and 6pm I don't know what it looks like on lmod hold on
LOL no it's uhhh lemm see all the recitations are numbered im 11AM and 12PM inn 13-5101	I'm just going to switch recitations if I don't get this one But it works out well w my firehose
yeah! Also usually people don't care if you go to a diff rec it's generally fine	Beautiful
as long as you let your recitation instructor know also also if you want me make sure to come to 13-5101 b/c theere are multiple 11AMs	Oh really? OK yeah I will I've never been to building 13 befroe My friend told me last semester he couldn't switch into your recitation so he just gave up his attendance and went to yours
oh lol if he just told me i wouldve given him credit actually i mightve just given him credit anyways haha if he signed in and stuff	Lol
we try our best to give u guys as much credit as possible tbh	Aw yay That's nice to know
:)	alex chen your R04 is COMPLETELY FULL
Lmao it’s just a good time slot!!	no you are FAMOUS the legendary alex chen never knew i was standing in the presence of a legend
lol nooooo you'll see im just a regular TA you got a slot tho!	Lol yeah u told me u were R04 before Jason Ku sent the email But switching was already open so I was one of the first people to switch into yours
also you're taking 9.00? that class is good :D	You can see my schedule???? Yeah if I don't get into 11.011
you sent it to me silly	I want to try a cogsci class Ohhhhh
lol	I'm tripping Too bad there's no 9 concentration tho
there's 6-9 :P	I mean that's too much 9 and not enough 6 tho
lmao fair	Mehhhh We'll see if I like it
Practice tonight???	SIR THE ONE DAY U DECIDE TO GO NO IM ON A PLANE TO DETROIT RN
NoooooooOOOOO come back	I'm coming back Sunday night but like way after practice ://
Rip lol Are you just visiting home?	Yeah originally this was supposed to be so I could get my cavities filled but Couldnt get an appt so now I'm just going home to see my family lol
Haha love it	Gonna et some good food Get off campus for two days
Tru Before a very very very fun semester :D	Bro I didn't get into 11.011 :ppp Just means I'll be taking 9.00 then Hopefully I won't be too hosed
You’ll be fine Depends on how try hard you’re going to be :p	Try hard enough to get an A? Hmm I mean so like I'm taking three 6 classes 8.02, and 9.00 Also what exactly do meng students do Like r u taking classes too
Wow that’s a lot Which 6s I might take distributed systems! People take much less As meng	006 08 036 What are your requirements as an meng
thesis and 4 grad classes or something	8.02 is on pnr o should be ok
but i took a lot of them during my Ugrad so im done with my requirements im just taking classes for funsies that sounds like funnnn wowow	6.08 should be fun yee I heard the labs are interesting
i hear good things about it	What is your thesis on
I'm doing research on older adults' interactions with personal robots in the home so i get to play with robots and program them to hang out with retired happy grandmas lmao it's great	Wait that is so fun And a cool thing to do too
Yes!! I’ll show you sometime :)	Yay please do
hi do you wanna be social chair for club tennis	Hi Not really no lol
what if i do it with u :P	I'd be an awful social chair
you'd be great!	I'm not even social
LOL you're plenty social don't undersell yourself	Whats the job description
half of: planning birthdays, a retreat, and maybe a handful of social events through the sem? birthdays will be lowkey retreat should be fun :O i really want to put together one this sem and social events can be impromptu	Hmm OK maybe If it's chill Can't be too overcommitted this semester
lol i think the bar is reasonably low because we haven't been terribly social in the past so i believe :D	OK fair lmao
ok what if we ask during prac on friday if anyone else is interested i think it'd be fun if we did it together though	Okokkkkk
okie	Let me think about it For like 2 hours I have class now anyways So it's a good time to zone out And I'll let u know
HAHA ok sounds good <3	ok i'll try but if i'm dying i'll just disappear forever
hahahah, let's ask if anyone is super keen for the job on fri maybe merrick really wants to throw parties who knows anyways how was your first two days? did you go to 006 today?	sg sir it could be fun if we do it together tho but we'll see if anybody else wants the spot first
yee :)	math parties
LOL facts	well it's been p good so far i only had two classes yesterday so today is like when i really find out if i can do school cuz i'm kind of hosed on tuesdays and thursdays evening 6.08 lab yay ofc i never miss lecture don't think u saw me tho but i was sitting quite close to the front actually like just right and up a little bit from where the TAs were sitting jason ku really added more 11am and 12pm sections cuz of you huh
lol it's not because of me silly!!! 11 and 12 are just popular :) i think our recitation this week is gonna be crowded tho so uh we'll see actually maybe not building 13 is so obscure	"alex chen i hope you know that i am RUNNING from my physics lecture tomorrow to get a good seat in your recitation tmrw every single person i've talked to about recitation has been like ""alex chennnn"" scoped it out today"
omfg i don't get it	what's the path of least resistance
everyone has such high expectations LOL	should i take the lobby elevator
im a nervous boi	wait no don't be nervous
where are you coming from	just be u
?	teal lab
hmmmmm	26-152
yeeeaaah probably you go out into the outer infinite go into lobby 13 then take the elevator probs the fastest	okay i figured that was the move
:D ahhHHHH the cram for blueprint continues	HI ALEX CHEN Yeah u guys are working so hard Thanks so much again lol Also do u know any C / C++/ Arduino I cannot for the life of me figure out this exercise problem
lol are you doing 6.08 i have a working knowledge of these things but not to any degree that would help you with your pset lol	Sorry o got back from lab like half an hour ago Was a grind But I think I figured it out To what extent idk
Looool	:pp how's the workshop coming along you guys are doing way more work than i'm doing for arduino
Haha it goes...	i'm sure it's doing more than going but what is it that u said' don't undersell yourself also save me
Haha wait are you teaching? :oooo	BRO I LITERALLY THOUGHT I WASN'T GOING TO I THOUGHT I WAS JUST GOING TO HELP OUT AND ALL OF A SUDDEN CLAIRE NORD WAS LIKE YEAH YOU'RE GONNA LEAD THIS THING SO PICK A WORKSHOP YOU WANT TO LEAD AND I LITERALLY JUST STARTED 6.08 TWO DAYS AGO AND I DON'T KNOW ANYTHINGGGGGG
Omgggg	I KNOW OMG
That’s a lot Wow That’s a lot a lot	ok well it's just this arduino thing so once that's over perhaps my life will be more in control :p do u know any good labs i should ask to urop in it's my futile first week of the semester hunt rn
oh wait do you wanna be my urop hahahahah	WHAT YOURE JOKING
lol im not i just submitted a UROP listing idk when it's gonna appear	omfg what yes what so cool omg you're so cool alex chen ok do i need to interview what do i need to do
LOL omg you honor me yeah im trying to just interview a few people and see what's up I can send you over the UROP description if you're interested :) and if you decide you might be interested you can pop over your resume and we find a time to chat	yee
"*UI/UX Frontend Engineering UROP with Personal Robotics Group*
Interested in mobile development, react, or robots? The Personal Robotics Group in the media lab is seeking a driven UROP with individual initiative for the spring.

This project would involve writing React Native features for a chatting mobile app, including search functionality, push notifications, etc. The features to implement would be open ended! The core features are completed, but I'm searching for a creative, motivated individual to help me build out fun and interesting extensions to the app.

Our lab is exploring how we can use personal robots in the homes of senior citizens to promote socialization and decrease loneliness. One of these projects involves building a chat feature for the robot, which would allow users to chat with friends and family through their robot. The robot would send messages to a mobile app, which family and friends could download and respond with. I'm hoping to polish this app over the next couple of months and launch it in mid spring.

*Pre-requisites*
Motivation and willingness to learn are most important! Experience with Javascript, especially React or React Native, and firebase are desired but not required. UROPs are for learning after all 

*Contact*
Send me your resume to me and we can schedule a time to chat!
Alex (achen19@mit.edu) Give it some thought!! :D"	wowow ok i'll take a look and let u know i have some emails out there rn for other urops too so i'll keep u updated also i'm incompetent at UI/UX/React/anything frontend lmfao you're right tho urops are for learning
ya urops are for learning!! heh, lmk	yes sir :))
hihi did my LMOD email work (did you get an email from me through LMOD just now)	don't think so?
hmmm rip ok let's hope the system isn't broken or something lmk if you get something in the next hour or so?	okie
ty :D are you going to prac tn?	yes r u
ya let's gooooo im gonna be rusty	whoohooo :pp when's the last time u hit
last practice but i was kind of a mess	aye better than me oh whale just got your email :)
oh whew it got through nice	yee
how's the blueprint prep	well the web app im working on is sort of working shape now which is good i did like very little of it btw i'm just organizing the people to do the things
oh lol are you teaching teachin?	yes lmao i figured it out today tho been at GSD since 3pm and did like an hour of practice w arduino like b4 lmao that's separate from the web app tho
what's GSD?	get shit done lmoa it's a term that hack likes to use
hahahah GSD i love it do you feel ready?	No but I'll live
heh im excited for tomorrow should be fun	I have to be there at 730am So needless to say I am not as excited Although I'm still p excited
lol oof when do i have to get there :'(	Not nearly as early I'll ask
okiii also are you coming to hang after prac :O	Oh I saw neerajs thing flash by Where was it again What's miracle of science
haha it's this like place that serves drinks and food based on an elements theme like a block down mass ave	Oh huh
if you goooo we can both leave early because we have blueprint lol i told neeraj id probably dip early	"Hmmmmmm Oh shit wait It's Claire's birthday today She's my roommate And we bought a cake for her and we're celebrating right after I get back from prwc ""theres no set time they have to be htere(whenever theyre free) but the first workshop starts at 10"""
ooohhh fun fun that's super cute! oh rly there's no like orientation or something	So I think the email they're going to send tonight counts as orientation
oh ok	Wait how long r u gonna stay at miracle of science Cuz my friend just said she won't be back until 10 But I don't wanna go and then just dip right away
yeah ill probably stay till around 10 im definitely going to leave by like 10 lol b/c i want to go home and dry run :P	Hmm OK maybe the N
okieee	Not sleep lol? Wait where do u live Sorry I mean like Where do most grad students live
hahahah i live in Ashdown which is like near simmons tbh i miss living in next	Oh u were a next kiddo I like next honestly Except for dostance
i was a maseeh kiddo before i was a next kiddo!!! maseeh 4!	Oh what Why'd ya moce move
Mmmm a lot of my friends are in next Also like when I lived in Maseeh it was kinda boring I hear it’s better now	Oh wow I totally forgot to respond It is yeah except my floor lmao But anyways u should come tmrw
Okkk are you just gonna hang and mentor?	yep hopefully more hanging less mentoring yeah just come hang w me media lab is lit there's a mentor lounge with food and stuff
okkk LOL	when r u going to come LOL WAS IT FUNNY
hmm idk ill just come when i wake up lmao	who's the chad react aight lmk :P
merrick lol if you come to the party you can hang out with meeee im going to be making drinks apparently	i'll watch u make drinks then lol?
looool or you can make drinks and i can watch	i know nothing sir just slosh all the things together as long as it gets u drunk amirite
that is u n w h o l e s o m e	you are the one MIXING THE DRINKS SIR explain to me the logic
slosh slosh	sloshity slosh slosh u can teach me how to bartend
hahah im a beginner! We can learn together	then why did neeraj assign u to this this is all wrong lmao but u do you
LOL I’m trying to learn though!!	ok fair fair just watch i'm actually gonna be sick on 12/15 now
that's my social chair	LMAO my friend just came up with the best response to that thread check it out
o h n o hahah i love it i think club tennis is hard b/c people are pretty far apart in age	thanks for the approval yeah that's true are some of the grad students on our team like like almost 9 years older? wait if you're an meng this year that's 4 years right
yeah but i think i culturally identify as an undergrad lol daniel is married :o	i can agree with this for the most part oh wait so is sneha wait who was paula engaged to again was it daniel i'm confused now it wasn't right i'm confusesd
LOL no i don't think we have any club tennis-cest We met paula’s fiancé at the social last sem He like runs or something	OH WHAT I THOUGHT HE WAS ON THE TENNIS TEAM THIS WHOLE TIME LMAO this is an interesting term oh what i'm totally tripping
LOL it's ok it's a big team hard to figure who's on it who's not	i feel like i meet a new person every single time i got to practice also do u have any familiarity with jwt at all
Mmmm I've used jwt once	do u know how to pass in the jwt token in request headers or smth like that
lemme see what i did in my project.. gimme a sec	thank you lmao this is for our web app that sort of needs to be deployed by tmrw
flask right?	yeah like i'm not too sure how react works but u make http requests how would u pass in the token
"I used flask_jwt um presumably fetch ah yeah you pass it in with the authorization header ex: here's what I do when I'm making a fetch to /get_students ```
getData = async () => {
    const url = window.location.origin;
    try {
      const response = await fetch(origin + '/get_students', {
        method: 'GET', // or 'PUT'
        headers: {
          'Accept': 'application/json',
          'Authorization': 'JWT ' + cookies.get('jwt')
        }
      });
      const json = await response.json();
      this.updateStudents(json)
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error:', error);
    }
  }
```"	oh i see is the token always named jwt when stored in cookies hold on i can just check
"uh wtf that should be 

```
await fetch(origin + '/get_students') ```
await fetch(origin + '/get_students')
``` ah double oops omfg it should be

```
await fetch(url + '/get_students')
``` I'm bad wtf this compiles? anyways uh yeah ummm i think it depends on your backend"	i'm going to check yeah hmm
I do a cookies.set inside my react component I think there's a way to set it from your backend too? but since it's jwt i don't think it matters (since JWT is url safe) which essentially means you can pass it around from frontend and backend without being too scared as long as you're on 	i think this is a flask thing maybe but it's set_access_cookies
yeahhh that seems reasonable :) it's easy to check just pop open ur chrome console and look at ur cookies	wait yeah actually so i was trying this yesterday with jianna idk if u met her but she's like working on this part of the web app
oh i didn't! can you introduce me tmr? :) are yall having trouble	and we copied the token but it just was saying on postman like something about not being allowed to access the endpoing bc no auth i forget the exact words but it wasn't reading the token correctly
uh yeah you need to pass it in under the Authorization Header	yeah ofc she's out for a good part of the day for some dance auditions and sk things but she'll be there for a bit
ok! when does this need to be done? out of curiousity	uhhh like ideally before judging tmrw but like we can always just use devpost worst comes to worst our dev head has been hosed recently so the part he was working on doesn't have functionality yet but like he's hosed and i can't be brought up to speed fast enough so it's alright
ah ok i can help work on it tmr! we can have a mini hackathon haha	omfg lmao this would be wonderful honestly i'll see tn if i can just make sure jianna's endpoints work correctly
yay this'll be fun!!! when should i show up tmr btw hahahahahah the saga continues	whenever u want um i have to be there by 6am but we're checking kids in at 7am and they're gonna get settled so just take your time just come whenever u wake up damn we got him good
holy ur gonna be a sleepy jamie	"indeed it's alright next weekend we chillin just gotta get through it also i'm basically getting the same error as yesterday {
  ""msg"": ""Missing cookie \""access_token_cookie\""""
} on a request with @jwt_required"
Ummm Have you tried just sending the request with postman Or like curl It sounds like your headers are wrong somehow	yeah so i'm doing it w postman right now and like literally just copying the access_token_cookie from stored cookies in chrome to Bearer token auth
Hmmm that’s weird I’ve never used postman I always just use curl Check your console logs maybe? Maybe something wrong with your formatting It has to be “JWT <token here>” Or	"i tried both with ""jwt ____"" and ""Bearer ____"" but neither seem to work uhhhhh yeah there's no logging in the console but like it should be working?"
Bearer? Yeah	this is a sad explanation
Hrm	it's ok i'll look at it more tmrw
We can look at it together! JWT is tricky.	okieeee thanks alexxxxx :))) i figured it out alex chen well i didn't i just asked someone who figured it out a summer ago but that just means we can probably safely use the backend endpoints now which is kind of nice
Nice!! What was the issue?	postman sucks
LMAO Rip	i needed to store the cookies in postman :p
This is why you use curl!!! I’ve never used postman That’s weird tho I’ve generally heard good things about it Glad you figured it out though	wait i tried that too tho
Wait rly?	i didn't really i just bugged an alum until he remembered how he did it yeah
I was able to paste in the token	well fack
When I used JWT Hmm Maybe it was some formatting issue	mehhhh
Anyways doesn’t matter now Glad you got it	lol yes it's not done yet but that's aight
You have all day! I’m coming over soonish :D Is there food	there's always food do we really aight cool
"what's the ""mentor key'"	wow this is so late but here it is
LOL Thanks You’re the best	lol yw
today was fun!! thanks again for inviting me :)	you're very welcome felt like i just gave u a job though can u give me the emails of everybody who helped out w the beginner web track for blueprint
yeah ummm	we're sending thank u emails :)) sorry to ruin the surprise for u lol even tho it's just an email
mfarejow@mit.edu niks@mit.edu kyeb@mit.edu cor@mit.edu jynnie@mit.edu	ty
o and me achen19 lmao	yep i didn't forget u did u get the email btw
yeah i did!!	alex what does 2b mean by in front of
uhh like in front of in terms of order of the array	sorry i mean like does it have to be directly in front of or if it's already way in front, do i still need to shift
"directly in front of! like exactly in front of not just ""more on the right of"" i guess (just checked to make sure) it can either be [... <k elements>, element at index j, ...] or [... element at index j,  <k elements>, ...] (element at index j might not be at index j anymore) after u move so really should be 
[... <k elements>, element formerly at index j, ...]"	wait what well yes but directly in front of right
yea	and there can be stuff like (<k elements>, things, elem at j) initially right
ya	and u want it to be (<k elems>, elem at j)
yes	ok cool
:D	thanks
yaaa ofc how goes	well now that u told me this there's two cases to account for in 2b so that's a bit sad but it's aight i'm definitely submitting this tn i'm so done
looool you have time!	well yeah but i think i'm done looking at this pset
hahahah fair fair	lol pray to 006 gods for easy grading
lol the graders are p chill	aight cool
Hiiii so just to follow up on your question after class today. (Which was a really good one!) Selection sort might mess up the order of the original array when switching the biggest element to the end, because the last element, which used to be last, is now earlier. So the way we’ve implemented it is not stable. There are ways to make selection stable but we don’t talk about it in the scope of the class	oh wow answering my question literally right after recitation okay yeah that makes sense depending on you select like the biggest elem right
lol I realized when teaching the next recitation Yeah The other kid who asked Was Matt right	yeah uhhh but in the case of insertion sort when i bubble my new element down i'm placing it after an elem that is technically equal to it right
Not if you stop right when you hit something equal to you And don’t go past Relative order is never disturbed for equal elements in insertion sort	right right
:D	ok yeah that makes sense
Yay	i mean there are also roundabout ways to achieve insertion sort in an unstable way too right
Lol yeah ofc	ok
But no reason to make it unstable	yeah but like we should assume they're achieved in this way for 006 ok this makes sense
Recitation today was so fast I hope people got it	i think it was ok
fingers crossed	oh build(X) for number 3 should it take exactly |X| time does simple memory allocation take time it does right so like basically
O(|X|) so could be 2X	oh ok cool
Did you go to practice last night did I miss anything	yeah i did just that tonight's social is canceled lol
Oh LOL f Did he say why	"because nobody is showing apparently sorry because ""the social chairs didn't pub it enough"""
oof called out i thought he would pub it more tbh lol but that ok, now we have free evenings	yeah exactly lol yeah i wonder who our social chairs are
...oof haha	lol
oh i see he rescheduled it	Yeah hey alex for number 1 a and b do we have to use omega(1) to lower bound? i heard that since a is leaf heavy u can bound it w theta but i'm not sure
Ya use 1 for lower bound And just solve If it’s the same as upper bound then it’s theta	well like part a is big O for f(n) but it's leaf heavy do i still lower bound by omega(1) or because it's leaf heavy can i just solve using master's and say theta
just lower bound by omega(1) it's the same process you mean for master thm right should take a couple lines	? yeah like can i say what i get from master theorem using the normal a is theta(leaves) because it's leaf heavy using the normal f(n) * like i think what you're trying to say is that i should still lower bound a with omega 1 and use master's
yes you should do that ^^ just use masters on T(n) = 4T(n/2) + n and T(n) = 4T(n/2) + 1 and ur good	ok cool but like some people were saying that even if i have T(n) = 4T(n/2) + O(n) i can get theta(n^2) even tho f(n) is big O sorry if this is confusing i know what i need to do but i'm just curious about when i'm allowed to use theta and when i'm not
wait wot oh yes ok so what happens when you run masters on the two equations above	oh wait so i'm literally incompetent it's because it's the fuking same
yeeee	so stupid lmao ok so that's the reasoning behind it right
yeah so if something is O(n^2) and OMega(n^2) then it's theta n^2	yeah lmao i just didn't realize that when u use omega(1) u also get omega(n^2) :p i will try to ask smarter questions next time
looool no dumb questions!!	r u sure
i am sure ask alllll the questions	"ok i will hey alex what's the timeout on the server for the code for #5 i've coded it recursively and it passes test cases 1-14 but 15 onward i'm just getting ""your code did not run to completion errors"""
if your alg is nlogn it should work hm. can i see your code?	yeah
ah this is because you're doing list slicing at every step doing B[1:] take O(n) time	shitttt smh that means i shouldn't do this recursively then
you can still do it recursively i think you just need to pass in the index instead of splicing the list each time	oh hmm ok i'll try that thanks alex
mhm!	ah yes that seems to have done the trick also i totally forgot there was no recitation today and took a trip up to 13-5101 today lmao
niCE glad to know you're this excited about recitation ^____^	was disappointing to see like half the lights off surprisingly there were still two people in the room tho they were the ones who informed me kindly that i was an idiot
LOL srs? rip wiat wait	i think they knew by then
did you get my email yesterday	uhhhhhhh yes....? but
oh	i may have
lmao	not remembered the contents of it
hahahah	i remembered where u said like u were going to explain substitution on friday and i remember thinking like huh why friday but then that was it
n i c e wao ur so on top of things wed and already done with the pset clap clap	uhhhh wait i haven't even thought about 4 yet and i still have to latex everything but thanks
lol well you got the coding done and that's most of the struggle	i guess so that's honestly the part i find the most fun lol
spoken like a true software engineer	meh i think i don't want to be software engineer anymore
interesting, what made the change?	uhhh my externship lol but now i like don't know what i want to do i mean it wasn't bad but idk i'm having a mid life crisis rn tbh
Haha yeah I didn’t like my first few intern/externships either	Why didn't u like yours Or like What made u not like yours
Mostly that the work wasn’t terribly impactful I kinda help babied Felt** As in the stuff I was doing was very useless and pretty not interesting But this got better as I got better internships	hmm ok yeah i think i feel that too maybe it will get better
it probably will but i found a lot of satisfaction and success in my own personal projects and i think as you gain more skills, you get to do more interesting things also computer science is suuuch a huge field e.g. i think data science is not really my thing neither is ML but I find design and UI/UX implementation to be super interesting	hmm ok i mean i still like cs i just don't enjoy swe atm
yeah that's fair i feel like swe can be tedious sometimes i think the trick is finding the right field to lik like	yee this is the struggle do i need to solve a summation if ik it converges to a constant
ummm if it clearly is a constant, should be fine to not solve it	okkie
do you think people understand lowerbounds vs upper bounds i am getting many confused kids	sorry i am just responding i saw your text aand answered in my head uhhh imo i think the distinction between the 2 is pretty clear it's just how to determine what run time u should use for lower bound that's a little confusing ig? and how u should use master's theorem to do lower and upper bounds
mmm i see	yee
do you think that throwing chocolate at people during recitation will make them more willing to participate	Duh Wait What kind of chocolate
lol idk what kind of chocolate do ppl like	Also I think the participation is not bad rn tho
ya i think it's worse in my second rec	I like kit kats
but also it's mostly similar people asking questions	Oh wait really
or not asking questions	Yeah fair
but answering questions	I know a lot of kiddos in your 12pm tho And they're p sociable
yeah idk i think maybe because it's bigger?	Oh yeah maybe What kind of participation do u want
or maybe i just see it in a tougher lens because im tired from 11 lol Or, I just want people to be engaged i want to make the material less boring because it can be dry with me just lecturing	I mean I feel like it's p interesting in general Do u want more people asking questions? Is that what it was
tbf you're also obligated to say that as my friend :P Hmmm no i think I want more people like actively engaging some poor kid fell asleep in my 12	That is false I think u do am excellent job
i think today i just lectured a bit too much	And all of my roommates and friends from across the hall idolize u
LOL omfg i'm honored so kitkats then?	No joke Omg ru actually bringing chocolate Amazing +++++ Wait wtf Maybe they were just tired
Definitely just tired It’s Friday	Lol wait don't feel bad you're doing excellent
Oh I don’t feel bad	Claire went to your recitation todau Btw Did u see her
Yes!!! It was cool to see her	Lol that's not even her normal recitation and she went sir
My recitation was a bit full tho so I hope that she still learned	I think today was actually good for understanding lec yesterday
Ya I hope so I think the main thing is that understanding material is sometimes slightly orthogonal to the exams	oh wait why cuz like understanding it is not necessarily needed on exams?
Exam problems are all like applying the material Yeah like you don’t actually need to know how a hash table works to apply it	wonderful still useful to know how it works tho
Yeah for sure btw re: your internship search do you want me to check with places I've been and check if they still have slots open? if so I can drop you a strong referral	omfg yes that would be amazing too kind :oo
ok! no guarantees that they have spots unfortunately, but I'm more than happy to look!	yee that would be amazing i should let u know if i hear back from smurf tmrw too i mean i think i'd still prefer an internship over the summer allthough singapore would be awesome but yeah tyty alex
mhm! I'll let you know if I hear anything	ok you're the best alex 
<3 you're definitely gonna find something you want!	aww thank u for your faith haha these days i feel like lowkey worried about it but it's only like lowkey now so that's better than before lmao
don't worry too much! Your freshman year is not terribly impactful in terms of internship, it's more about learning tbh if i just sat at home and learned a skill over summer of my freshman year i probs would've been better off.. lol	lol ok hmm yeah this is true probably yeah i'll try not to worry that much thanks alex :)))) btw did u end up getting to talk to neeraj
I texted him, haven't heard back yet though i think he's ok? he seemed better at the end of prac	yeah hmm :p oh that emoji appeared way happier than it should have don't laugh using emojis is hard
same you know messenger is going to come out with an update	wait what
that allows you to use any emoji to react	on what about what
soooo	oh what
many more ways to mess up	that's too much
hahahah	how is that going to work i still don't have the regular heart emoji react only the heart react heart eyes*
Yeah same  We are not the lucky few	is it just like a beta testing thing or an iphone thing or what wait no u have an iphone
Haha yeah they test it on a small percentage To see the effects It’s random btw what are you interested in in terms of stuff to work on	Oh wait really What are the effects so far then What do u think Hmm like what industry?
Lol unclear mmmm more like what subfield of CS like web? ML? it's ok if it's unknown	I think any sort of consumer facing tech would be cool or something to do with economics or markets would also be cool But subfield specifically ML and maybe NLP within that And software engineering And I like backend work more but actually would definitely want to try frontend Computer vision is where my ML experience is kind of in tho
okie that sounds good!	Yee
	Oh shitttttt This is beautiful OK imma do this asap
ok! I'm also checking with FB but i doubt they have availabilities at this point but we will try!!	yeah makes sense msoft told me they could only do smth summer 2021 too :pp yes!! haha omg why are you such a good person alex
loool im not!! any friend would do this glad to help you find stuff you deserve it lmk if you want interview tips, it's actually kind of 006-ey	ah yes i have heard this 006 is apparently the class to take for technical interviews yus i will tho
Yaaaa	wait literally no this is like not like a standard thing people just do ok applied! let's see how it goess
Hahah happy to help Yayyy Hopefully she gets back to you soon :) Pure was really fun I was there sophomore summer	yay this is excitingggg i'm going to do some research on the company tmrw but yay and start my 006 pset lmao i should probably start that tmrw right
Lol seems like you’ve been doing fine so far Hopefully this pset is a bit shorter...	i think my friends who are about wrapping it out spend like 10 hours on it total or will spend 10 hours on it i'll go to office hours tmrw ml well actually idk yet i think i should go once i have a lot of questions
You should go when I’m there!! Hahah	i would be very happy to alex but you are always toooo busy i can try on wednesday night tho
lol i don't even know when im doing OH this week tbh	oh wait it changes every week? aha ok
lol no it doesn't, I've just been switching with people a lot agh im so lazy	Wait what's so bad about switching and why does that make u lazy
Oh those were independent Lol I still haven’t gone to campus yet..	Ohhh Wait do u have to be here for smth Or just motivation
Motivation!! And meetings Also also do you want to send me your resume? My Facebook recruiter got back to me and said he’d be willing to look for some spots if there’s a good fit even though they’re nearing the end of their recruiting season	Oh shitt Yeah I'll send u it Also
Ok!	I think this may be a problem But I just got into smurf And 8 have to respond by March 1 2* I'm not sure what to do tho
Oh woah congrats!! Hmmm idk it’s hard to say	Aha thanks
I hear great things about smurf You can drop your resume anyways, and If they get back to you in time then make a decision It’s like 2 weeks till March 8th Oh 2nd oops	Okay :))
That’s sooner I guess	Yeah Merp
But it doesn’t hurt	Ok Im in class rn But will send I mean I'm paying attention in class And texting u in between
LOL Honored	Aha I mean 6.08 is just funny stuff Most learning is done in lab
You guys have lectures? Dang yeah I thought it was just a lab class.	Basically it is sent btw!
yayyy ok ill send it along i didn't know smurf had such a tight deadline maybe they'll let you extend it	yeah i am confuse as well yeah i should ask
i wonder how these international programs will be affected by COVID my parents are so spooked they don't even want me to leave my dorm if i don't have to	omg lmao my parents are the EXACT same but yeah misti china is technically on hold rn singapore is still up and running ig
did you tell them you were planning to do smurf?	"mm i think my parents think it'll be ok by june but yeah they keep telling me stuff like ""don't go to crowded places"" or ""stay away from other chinese people"" and i was like you do realize i go to school"
Classic	with other people many of whom are chinese
Yeah my parents literally tell me the same thing I imagine there’s a lot of disinformation making its way around WeChat Haha	LOL i mean it's true that there have been cases in boston tho
only one case iirc so you're probably more likely to get run over by a bus or something lol bcc'd you in email, I think they'll reach out to you so you don't need to do anything	Oh beautiful thank you alex Lmfao Facts At this point this is very likely I keep forgetting to look left and right before crossing the road
o m g hello pls don't get run over by a bus this ain't Novi Michigan	LMFAO I think it's worse to do this in michigan At least here a lot of people have that tendency Sometimes u just gotta go for it alex i am kind of struggling on this pset but have literally kind of like packed evenings until it's due is there a convenient time i can ask you lots of questions
Ya! You can msg me anytime, or I have a decent block of time on Wednesday where I’m free so maybe we can just pset together	amazing thanks so much alex :)) idk if this works for you but wed i can do like 3pm through 530 and 7pm onwards or smth but this is also sort of late so idk if that's what u meant
3pm sounds perf for me!	Spotted in infinite You're welcome
it is weDNESDAY my dudes i wonder if i said that during recitation ppl would laugh	Questionable Admittedly this is my kind of humor but It is indeed a niche type of humor
"you know the first time I heard ""it's wednesday my dudes"" was on that one vine"	I never did Vine Alas
well same but  High quality content so i was not aware of the frog until recently lol	What the Fuck Holy This content is crazy
yeah open ur meeting with that 100% asserts dominance	Oop Did not assert dominance
Btw did the smurf coordinator say anything about coronavirus affecting the plans?	She said it was contingent on mit and Singapore travel restrictions Which is actually currently open
yeah that makes sense i don't think it's too bad yet but it could potentially worsen with time, so you shouldn't rule out not being able to go	Eek Yes True Knock on wood
but it's ok! worst case you can hang out with me in the states lol	Damn you really called yourself a worst case Yeah it'll be fine either way
just humbled by the great international traveling Fu, that's all	Lmfao yeah no I don't think u should be alex when we hash the keys for #5 we can assume that the hash table is like of size A right using universal hash function?
The hash table should have size A - k + 1 right Where size is the number of keys	oh right yes that's just how universal hashing works tho right
Universal hashing just means that like Expected O(1) chains	ohhhh but the size of the hash table is defined beforehand right
Size meaning number of keys? Or number of slots	uhhhhh wait are those not the same thing wdym by slots
Yeah remember Each slot has a chain Of keys	oh yes but expected one key per one slot right so then i mean slots decided ahead of time
O(1)	oh yes
So could be like 5 Ummm	makes sense
Ya so you start with one slot And then you table double Kinda like in arrays	wait when do you table double?
Whenever the number of keys  = number of slots Just like in array That way average of 1 key per slot	oh what do i need to write this out
No Absolutely not	ok haha
You can black box the hash table	and just say that you can do every hashing thing in O(1) time expected?
Yeah in general you'll never have to deal with like hash table internals unless we specifically ask for it	okay thank you :))
Do you think people understand the augmentation stuff I feel like it was hard to follow	I don't understand while this is called agumentation But like Sort of ig
Lol ok that’s not a terrible problem to have	Oh jk is he clearing this up rn
Haha	Why is at least exponential at most log
He’s just proving That the number of nodes in a tree Is some kind of 2^h If the tree is balanced Therefore h is log n Essentially, a balanced BST has log n height	Right but why Does at least turn into at most
I think he’s saying that if the tree is balanced The number of nodes in a tree is at least 2^h Or At most 2^h Oh oops yeah at least 2^h And then if you do the math out You get h < log n So now the height is O(log n) So all ops run in log n Dude Recitation today was so rushed Oh wait you’re probably playing in the match rn lol	Uh It was chill Ed and I lost our set 4-6
Ooo close	U forgot to give Sarah a piece of chocolate
Oops	Nah the dude hit everything so hard I was so scared lmfao
Was it fun tho	Yeah sort of I am Really tired And hosed
Awww Try not to stress too much!! I think i should’ve covered the example a bit more in depth	Unfortunately this is unavoidable Which one There's a hack after party I just got roped into going to
Like the one at the very end with 1s and 0s I feel like it was too rushed But tbh we just had sooo much content Damn look at you you social butterfly	Oh I remember now Yeah faxts Am I really
are u gonna get lit i hear hack ppl go really hard	They do So I'm a bit worried
Oof Worried about what	oh it's chill i just came bakc lol i was there for like less than an hour lmao they drink too much
Haha yeah College	well ig it doesn't matter how much u want to drink just my personal pref
ya! drinking isn't good for you anyways good for you as in like, good on you for not feeling like you have to	lol yeah jianna told me she's cutting down because it makes her feel fat after yeah idk i feel like i don't feel peer pressure to the extent where it could be a bad thing tho that's called stubbornness mb
hahaha have you drank since coming to college?	not really lol i didn't really drink before college either the most i've ever had was probably just like a glass or two of wine on my cruise to the bahamas last spring breka
yeah honestly drinking is high effort lol nice cocktails and wine is good tho! I think that's just a time commitment to make haha	Lmao I see u out here being boujee
we were supposed to do it together last time remember? :D	Ahaha lol yeah hi alex ik you're teaching rn but later can you explain the building heaps thing again to me
ya	Tyty :))
yaaah Hi ok so yeah building heaps is weird e Essentially you can do some tricky math to get this to work So the amount of work it takes per node at max is its distance from the bottom of the tree Its height right	ummm like when you place it in the heap? the time it takes to put it in like a correct location?
Yeah Remember we build from ground up So you build the leaves first Where the number of rotations is 0 Oops swaps Not rotations Then the next level has 1 swap Then the next level has 2 swaps And so on	oh yes wait so like if you get an array you just iterate through it and put some number of them
Ya	as leafs lelaves
Half of them	oh right
As leaves yeah	yeah
Yeah ok so Each node just has to switch its height number of times Right	yeah
Ok. So let’s pick an arbitrary level that is height h Above the leaves So how many nodes does that level have If it’s h levels above the leaves It’s actually just n/(2^(h+1)) Where n is the number of nodes in the tree When h = 0 number of nodes is n/2 When h=1 number of nodes is n/4 And on	oh yep
Yeee ok	oh and if u sum them it just gives u some order of n
So the total time to switch around all the nodes Yeah so it’s like Sum of 0 to log n (which is the total height of the tree)	rightt
n/(2^(h+1)) * h Because it’s just number of nodes times number of switches If you bash out the math You get 2n	oh interesting i see but we won't be asked to bash it out or explain it like ever right
Yeah Probably not Besides the intuitive part about like Most nodes are so cheap And the ones that are expensive are at the top	hmm yeah i see that makes sense thanks alex :))
Yah np!! Do you think rec today went ok?	yeah i think so it was good i was not an active participant today alas but you had other people contributing so that was good how did 12pm go
As usual a bit more quiet than 11 but I think it’s also a bit bigger I’m afraid people are like Confused af but don’t want to ask questions	huh that's possible but unavoidable right
Yeaaaaahhh we’ll see How are you feeling about quiz next wk	lol not good i literally never know what to do on the psets
Same dude	wow how can u even say that if that's you what am i
lol this unit is tricky!!! don't worry too much :) the exam will be fine im always around if you need anything also i struggled pretty hard in this class to be fair	that's perfect i actually have a question regarding num 4 on the pset
sure what's up	for like the buildings is the idea that you should hash the buildings to somehash table correct because we were thinking that in order to find the solar farm associated with the building you need to hash some building to a pointer to the solar farm node or smth
yeah that sounds right :D	but we're also hashing each solar farm id to a linked list of buildings associated with it but dodsn't that mean if you power off a building you have to traverse that entire linked list to remove it from that solar farm
not if you hash the building to its node on the linked list instead of building to solar farm	ahhhhh i see this is too hard
hahahah yeah it's a lot right	YES
there's a lot of moving pieces on these kinds of questions	who made this pset and where can i go fight them
go fight jason	ummmmm ok maybe not can we add some augmentation to an AVL tree as we initialize it and AVL trees also take O(n) time to initialize right if i'm trying to include some augmentation property as i'm building it technically it's not an insert and won't take another O(logn) time right for reference i'm asking about number 4
Yes	oh beautiful
As long as The augmentation is maintainable in constant time Also only sequence avls are O(n)	oh what because you have to sort the set avl by key right
Yeah	aha
Yee	also really quick we don't need a pointer from a building to its solar farm, only to its own node in the solar farm's linked list right because in power_off we can take up to O(logn) time so we can still spend some time traversing the tree to find the key we nee
Umm depends Are you using a set AVL or sequence AVL	sequence or yeah sequence oh shit it needs to be aset AVL
Sequences don’t have keys Ya rip	oh wait but if it needs to be a set you can't initialize in O(n) time right so it still has to be a sequence avl tree but u need to point to both a solar farm and the corresponding building node when trying to delete
So Yeah So you’ll need to look up farms and look up buildings But keep in mind You don’t need to put the building in a specific farm When you turn on You just need a single farm That has enough cap	right hmm but when u power off you have to make sure you add back to the capacity of the same solar farm u were using before but like there's some augmentation u can do with the tree such that you know if there's a solar farm with enough cap in your subtree i don't understand how powering off would be O(logn) time then tho
Yeah you need more structures	oh is it O(logn) to fix the max_cap augmentation oh yeha i think so
Yeah As long as it’s maintainable Which I think it is called you.	ok cool i think i may have the correct answer now
Oops Yayy okie	eheh latexing makes me think too hard about how to actually formulate my answer i finished the pset sort of yesterday
Lol	but writing it up is always hard
Yeah it is But that’s important	yus indeed wait in the solar farm case oh wait jk nvm we're good
Lol What are your structures	ok so there's an AVL tree for the solar farms we hash solar farm addresses to a hash table and these things that are being hashed have pointers to a linked list of building nodes for the ones that are using that particular solar farm then we also have a hash table for the building addresses which point to the solar farm it's using and the building node in the linked list from that solar farm and teh AVL tree has the augmentation that it has the max_capacity of a solar farm from any one of its subtree nodes
Yeah seems reasonable	wonderful this is so convoluted
True Did you do coding	yep i did that last night should make 6 a little easier
Okayyy	:DD
make sure to take care of yourself and sleep!! I'm sorry smurf got cancelled :'(	Aww thanks haha I'll be OK :))
ok! i'm around if you need anything	thanks alexxxxx
also :o are we getting a cake for neeraj	oh should we
yeah! we definitely should	should we ask if claire already got one
yaaa probs maybe we can give it to him on sunday or something	oh huh ok i mean paris baguette is still open wonder if we could just get something now
most of team wont be at prac today tho should ask claire	oh facts i totally forgot lol
lmao yeah idk	:] oh what :]] turns into :))
:] oh lame they're so different :]]]]	ikkkkk
are you going to neeraj's thing	the social tonight? i have to do app reading for hack alas
awww fair wao madame director	hey it's not just me everybody on hack has to
truly hard working	lol i'm so dead today last night i didn't even need to stay up
:///	oh whale Is it too late to request a makeup exam for 006
im not sure :O possibly are you ok? it's never too late to like try	Uh no I have 6.08 lab that I don't want to move lmao Like I can't move it Because there's no room in the other sections That I can make
oof ummm yeah email 6.006-questions@mit.edu	Ok There's like a request form on alg But idk if it's too late for that yeah I cannot believe it is Monday again where did my weekend go
yeah you should email directly also i feel like uh classes are gonna get cancelled very soon	Lecture is already cancelled tomorrow But the exam is still on And 6.08 lab hasn't sent me anything yet It's also less than 150 students
i see i see	So I'll email later today and hope for the best
yeah	hi alex
Hey	do you know anything about
Not really	ok
I’m still learning	lmao ok this is big sad have u seen the slack message circulating
Nothing official has been told to the TAs Yeah I’ve seen it	ok big sad so sad sadder for you probably :(((
Yeah bad way to round out my last year but It’s ok People are freaking out Understandably	i bet
Im a little bit spooked too I can’t really go home	oh right what are you gonna do if they're kicking everybody out stressful situation
Idk	:((((
I might self quarantine for 2 weeks and then go home Maybe I’m not sure yet	i am very confused and lost atm
Recitation is still on tmr tho soooo Lol	lmao nice great i'll see you one last time before u disappear forever
I don’t think we’re taking attendance tho Ehhh class might start again? Idk	oh i see hmm doubtful since all big schools have canceled for the rest of the year we're going virtual which will suck
Rip	because harder to find pset buddies
It’s ok We can hang out in virtua OH lmao	LMAO so sad virtual tennis too?
F Yeah sure Wii tennis :p dang this is a lot	uh what happened where
idk it's just	can i find it
everyone is freaking out	yes everybody is did you check out killian before the cops shut it down i am
i saw HAHA	on edge yeah it was crazy
so keep this on the dL but im trying to convince profs to cancel the exam	oh
idk if itll work tho lol	ok yeah thanks alex i actually am like
idk i just feel like people don't really want to study rn	not in a good mindset lol
yeah i agree	:((
if i was in the class i'd be screwed this thing is so stressful	i'm so like stressed
it's like a major disruption	idk this sucks
<3 it's ok everything will be fine	haha u stay strong too alex you're in a tigheter situation than me
yeah idk if im gonna graduate ... rip	:o
my research is like	no wait no you will
human trials on older adults	do not
lol	worry
great time for coronavirus	they will figure everything out
i can't run an experiment now yeah probs but it's in a state of uncertainty just like everything else	yeah
i wish they would just drop the email did you hear 046 canceled	yes
yea	006 send the screenshot lmao our gc i mean
yeah your big-ass groupchat with all the students lol	:DD somehow i made my way into all of them lmao it's more like :// :oo :((( rn but
looool nice	it's a resource i suppose i have like all the channels open rn trying to stay updated
yeah there's a lot	it is a lot
i think this is pretty much confirmed to happen right	i hope they refund us for housing and meal plans
if it wasn't then they'd definitely like	yes
tell us	yeah ik they[re just holding off on the decision
but like that just makes it more stressful	yeah ik
also MA just declared a state emergency	oh fuc really
yeah cases doubled again overnight	fuckkkkk
i will keep you updated on my efforts to get the exam canceled or moved tho jason tends to be pretty stubborn	tysm
idk do you have any other exams	yeah lol i don't this week
ugh i just feel like it's such a shitty time	but next week i have like 2 or 3
for corona + exam	a lot of people have 3 at least this week
like what a terrible timing right	yeah ik
like studying + dealing with flights + storage + where tf do i go???? how does one handle that	:(((((
i haven't done work all day	wait take time for yourself first seriously
Yeah, i think everyone is trying to it's just easy to get caught up in the craziness right now im more concerned about my students, i don't really have exams so it's a bit less for me damn	alex don't u think they should quarantine us
what terrible timing	because if they kick us out
yeah idk	won't we just take it everywhere
well here's the thing right yes this is true and that's why it's pretty questionable ut but if they keep us on campus	but all other schools are kicking their kids out
they're liable for us	well yeah but in terms of national safety it shouldn't just be a liability issue
yeah it's a tough spot but if they keep us on campus and one person gets it that's soooo bad	then we're all fucked
because then they're liable for like	yeah
a bunch of sick kids but if ur home.... then they're not responsible?	the whole class of 2020-2023 fucked hmm yeah
idk it's touch tough	the uncertainty in the air
like how are they gonna feed us during a quarantine idek	oh shit
right so i guess like if someone here gets symptoms sending everyone home is straight trolling but if they do is proactively, it's like ok maybe nobody has it yet but yeah it's risky and probably worse for public health than just staying put (but better for the university if we leave probs?)	yeah better for MIT well have u seen confessions there are at least a few people who have it already
yeah it's crazy unverified tho it can appear like the flu b u t cases keep doubling soooo	some people know and won't say smh
yeah it's scary because we just don't know what a mess	:((((
email just got sent	Saw :((
Holy moly	what happened
Well This is a lot What’s next I wonder	yeah any status updates?
for 006: *don't leak this* or screenshot, but we managed to push the profs hard enough to make them think about letting the exam be remote but this is not confirmed im not sure what will happen yet	ok i won't but ok still this week tho?
i doubt it if they're going to let this thing go remote i bet they'd ask you guys to turn it in like, before the end of next week or something	oh i see this is crazy
i just argued really hard that it's not reasonable to ask you guys to take the exam AND worry about moving out im very surprised MIT did this	i don't have summer storage yet! and i have a flight booked for the 21st that idk if i can move
same... my flight is also later	:(( this is stress inducing
yes agree what airline maybe you can rebook im planning to call jetblue	i have a delta flight not sure when i'd rebook it for then tho* jason's email did u see sounds like it's still on for thursday
oof yeah i did idk he hasn't really consulted us at all...	crazy
yeah idk i feel this is all a bit unfair	it'd probably be very hard for them to reschedule given how many changes they've had to make
yeah agree	but also idk
but just because something is hard	this seems not good
doesn't mean it's not worth doing	right u sound upset are you ok ok actually just stop worrying about this for a second and think about what you need to do now because there are definitely enough people bothering jason about this
i guess that means we're not going to nationals for club... lol	:(((((( nooo i'm so sad i didn't expect to say goodbye this fast
yeah im really sad actually this was such a fun semester	me too am sad
home is much less fun than campus tbh	agree i realized that as much as home is comfortable what about the friendos
tru ok 006 chat is on fire right now	your TA chat? yeah i bet
yeah we're drafting up a letter to instructors... to try to get them to cancel DL tho	damn
or move at least	omg you guys are so dedicated to us i just want u to know in case i never get to see you again alex that i really appreciate you and that you're just like an amazing human being lol but actually without the lol
you are the sweetest and I'm glad we got to be friends this sem but that doesn't end here!!!	haha me too :))) it better not smh
You think anyone is coming to recitation tomorrow	hell yeah i'm going
Lmao Exam moved!	alex thank u so much for your tireless work
Haha I’m sure Jason was already thinking it if I was able to convince him The man is very stubborn But I’m glad That the right outcome was chosen in the end	yeah haha hmm
Let’s keep my involvement on the DL though, I want people to see our announcements from one united front	yeah i havne't told anybody
Ok :) Yeah I’m so glad We managed to get him to push	thanks so much alex i just booked my flight home have to rush packing all day saturday tho big sad
Sad	will we still do tennis on friday
No idea Lol	well now that's there's officially no recitation
Rip no recitation tomorrow	let's try to actually meet up
</3	before everything goes to shit
Yeah Jeez I’m still processing My mit is over	nooooooooo have they told you guys what is happening i'm so sorry alex
No idea I have a lot to figure out Like what is gonna happen to my housing	yeah are they making you leave too i thought mengs get to stay
I’m not sure...	that's what claire nord said
im in a bit of tough spot though im afraid they're going to put on travel restrictions like in Italy	are you planning on going to italy it's p bad in italy rn
no im not going to italy lmao but my mom has stage 4 cancer i can't go home it's too risky but if i don't go home now what if they lock down the region and i never get to see her ever again	oh shit ok alex is there anywhere else you can stay go home and quarantine for 2 weeks and then go see your mom
yeah i think that might be the move i'm not sure yet though tbh, having me at home might not be the best thing for parents they have so much to deal with already it's just a tough spot	I'm sure they want u back though right Will you be OK if you don't go back is the more important question Make sure You take care of yourself too I know you want to do what's best For your parents But I'm sure there's a way To make it work
im not sure everything is so unsure :(	there's still time if you want to walk through your options with me we can also do that but you'll be ok alex even if it seems bad rn you'll be ok
I think I have to book tickets tho also what are you doing for storage	Ok You can Should* Book tickets Because I think you'll regret it if you don't go home My mom has a friend in Boston that's coming over on satirday To take some stuff
holy nice	I didn't even know it was an option until today It's just because it's a little late to find storage Normally I would use storage
yeah it is a bit late hrmmmm this is a conundrum	did u figure out how long u have
For what Till my flight? I’m still on hold hahaha	before u have to move out oh are you trying to move your old flight?
I actually don’t have to move out But I think I will Yeah Move it to this weekend	ok that makes sense
Dang they just found two cases in Michigan	Wait wtf Where
	Oh shit
yeah D: be safe	I will Did u figure out your plans
Yeah I’m flying Saturday	OK great now you h@ve a timeline of when u need to be where right
Yeah :) gotta pack my life up, wbu	Aw wait it's not the end yet Also Needing to pack up soon
Are you driving or flying	Flying Satirday What time r u leaving
Nights Night** Hbu	Night 9pm Well Ubering to airport at 7
Wtf my flight is at 9 too HAHA But I might go earlier we’ll see	Wait do u wanna just uber there together
Are you checking luggage and stuff?	Yes Should probably go at like 630 actually
You’re flying delta right	JetBlue actually
WhAAAAT? same ...	…
You’re not flying to Las Vegas are you...	R u sure you're going back to california Oh What r u going to vegas for Im going to Michigan silly
Lol my girlfriend lives there! Ok yes figured lmao I’m going to self quarantine in Vegas for 2 wks Before i head home Don’t want to get mom sick	Oh ok that makes sense But what about between u go from Vegas to California
Probably drive Minimize the risk of infection	Got it
What are you doing for storage :o	Moms friends house Bought some boxes off Amazon yesterday
Oh yeah I asked already Damn how much	Dunno actually my dad just bought them without really asking me Maseeh is supposedly giving us boxes too so Idk
Dang	yeah i bought a lot though so let me know if u want some there's like 10 cardboard boxes
Omg you’re a savior ok	lol yeah they're coming tomorrow evening i'll hit u up
Thanks fam My roommate Is coughing And I’m spooked Lol	omg lol kick him out
Lol it’s probably just like a cold riiiight	kick his ass out send him to medical
That seems a bit mean lol I think everyone is just freaking out The prior of corona vs a cold swings heavily in favor of a cold	lol ik don't do it
Hahaha I’m still in shock this is so sad	ik it is idek what to tell you tho it is just sad i guess what i'm trying to do is just spend a lot of time with my friends and try to enjoy it because being sad won't do me any good
sigh yeah dude plz defenestrate me where im going: pollen count lol	NICE do u also habe Spring allergies
i have TERRIBLE spring allergies like legit so bad	Take zyrtec
i did lol pro tip you can buy zyrtec generics at MIT medical	Tf
yeah it's FIVE DOLLARS for 100 pills	What is generics Like just the Oh wait what
like same active ingredient just not the zyrtec brand same pill no label	Oh I see
yeah idk i was shook	maseeh has cardboard boxes on ground floor if you don't want to wait for my boxes to come
i got some from ashdown!	oh nice
how does packing goes*	two boxes done those are getting thrown in maseeh the rest is to my family friend i don't have the boxes for that yet tho i'm packing some of my nonessential shoes and clothese rn
yeah im wondering what to bring and what to toss sigh wish we had recitation today i wanted to say bye to everyone	:(((( same highkey
are you going to prac tn	tonight? probably not i'm getting dinner with my rommmates i'll go for a bit on friday want to see everybody
yeah same idk if i should go tn	you must have a lot on your plate rn dont go if you don't think it'll increase your happiness more than it will add to your stress
haha it's all a delicate balance can you believe that like in a few days we'll be home	no i cannot
we tried zoom today for 006 lol it's kinda troll idk i feel like it'll be super weird to teach recitation over that	lol gotta make it work tho?
Yeah somehow	We'll be ok Everything will be A Ok
someone in csail got it :o	Holy Not good
jk apparently it was just getting exposed to it? idek at this point	Oh huh
I think everyone is just being super uptight	Yeah gotta be more nervous about it now ig
fuck i have so much candy	Well I am In Maseeh And willing To walk
l m a o what if everytime someone answers a question i ship them via express mail a candy	I think You will be Broke In the very near Future
yeah after this week's stock market performance...	:(( Wait so r u actually gonna uber to the airport w me Because Shirlyn wants to come too
ok that's perfect then we have 4?	Who's the fourth
Rachel with whom im flying to vegas her mom was like you guys	OK no idea but sounds great
are going to stay in ur rooms lol i think her mom is a bit spooked about the virus	Vegas is
which makes sense	Too fun OK no It gets tiring After a week
tru still really high pollen counts there rip	Lmao yeah you're gonna suffer
Wait how much stuff do you have Rachel and I just realized we have a lot stuff Might be better to split	I have a large suitcase and a small suitcase Lmao OK fair
Like I think we could fit everything barely in an X Lol but I’ll see you at airport maybe?	Yes Lol Moved my flight to tmrw
Omg Is it because of the rumors	Yes
What have you heard	Boston is closing And a sophomore Has corona
Wyd Wtf Serious??? Jesus Where did you hear it from That’s very serious When did you hear Boston closing??	Right before the announcement came
Dang. Do you know when No one is going to care about 006 anymore lmao	What the fuck Is this just pnr
Yeah	Fuck
Yeah rip no one is coming to recitation anymore	To be fair It's virtual
Yeah I guess lol Still though I think people will care much less which is sad	Yeah U doing OK otherwise
A bit worried about everything	Same
Idk World is going to shit :/ I don’t even know if I should go to Vegas at this point What if I start showing symptoms	Idk It actually is going to shit It's so svary
When’s your flight??	On it rn Sorry I didn't get to say bye T.T
Ahhh it’s ok I’m glad you got out	Thanks will u be OK
I think so I hope Logan doesn’t close today that’d be pretty Difficult	I don't think it will since They moved us up they're trying to close until we're out right
Yeah ig You think they’re going to legit close borders	Yes Legot Legit
No way There’s no way they can just like Lock down California That’s straight trolling	Oh wait no Not California yet eight Boston
Mmmm yeah I suppose Damn	Yeah
Hopefully I’ll see you again someday they just canceled prac tonight	:(( Please let it be soon Won't u be working in Boston in the fall
ill be in NYC but ill come back and visit! and you should come visit me :>	OK down I want to go watch the us open in August anywahs Will u be there
:OOOOO i've wanted to watch the US open for forever	Come with
down idk if ill be in NY by then i hope so	Ya me neither Idk anything rn
did you get home safe?	Yes sir I did Hope you do too!!
Yay	Haha it is day 1 of being Locked in the room
Oof Yeah that starts for me tmr...	:///
hmm mit just got sitewide licenses to zoom guess that's what we're using	oh interesting was there an email sent about this
i just heard from my PI	did you figure everything out with your PI and research and things
Yeah I’m trying to complete thesis remotely But we shall see	ok i believe in you alex!!!!
Holy fuck There are two old ladies sitting right behind me on the plane who keep hacking their lungs out	hi friend oh wtf are you on the plane now??? bro
Yeah	you got the mask?
Yeah But still	got a hood?
Masks aren’t 100 percent	eek this is not good
I am very freaked out	ok stay calm they could just be old ladies with bad throats
That’s true	and you're young too so no matter what ik u will be ok stay safe in vegas do not
I’m more worried about giving it to my parents	yeah i understand that but you'll be quarantined for a while rigbht
Yeah But still ughhhhh	ik this sucks when will you be there
Ummm 2.5 hours?	That is A significant period of time Hmm
Yes Yes it is I just asked a flight attendant and they moved us up	oh that's good
I’m still very spooked tho	i thinik you'll be ok as long as u take the necessary precautions which you are so there's not much more u can do
:/// Yeah	try not to overthink it don't add unnecessary stress!
How’s home?	i've only experienced my room and the bathroom in the last 36 hours so not bad i'm on season 2 of the good place rewatched a movie and started learning react got motivation to build a personal website but don't have the means to do it yet
Holy crap I love react	and started a blog on medium in which i hope to post smth in the next few days
Omg you’re a blogger?? Haha That’s legit	oh no definitely not i remember when i thought tumblr would be my microblogging platform but now it's just where i go find kpop related things
Ah tumblr What a time	it is still a time in fact not really but whatever
my eye is itchy but i don't want to touch my face what do	i know not how to solve this problem can u rub it against the inside of your shirt or smth
lol what if she coughed on me and a virus particle got on my shirt then im screwed (but yeah ur probably right that seems like the move) i still have two hours left	omg you're such an overthinker alex lol you're right tho safety first don't think about the eye
yeah i do tend to overthink are you excited for your zoom education zoom institute of technology	my brother was calling me a zoomer over winter break now i'm actually a zoomer
i think running recitation is going to be lowkey trolling so idk wait tru	it'll be an experimental phase in all of our lives
true i don't think anyone is gonna show up	i will definitely show up why wouldn't we show up everybody loves you is it alright if I write about you in my blog post
ofc u can write about me!! as long as i can read it :. :>	yes will be public it's just like a sentence or two recap of the year
wooow fun it's good to keep a record after a while everything starts to blur together	yeah i'm trying to remember as much as possible rn
we have to play tennis together again one day rip dude freaking coronavirus	:(( agree
plz come visit next yr	new york? absolutely
yayyy	:DDD  hi here it is lmk if there are any typos ig :pp
!!!! hype omg you did FLP!	i did do FLP!
27 is a mood awww Claire this is so wholesome <3 so sweet	lol 27 is a mood
i love reading about all your adventures! you should blog more	also is this u accidentally calling me claire
oh wtf	or am i just confused
LOLLL no im trolling it's because i just read the name claire in ur post HAHA	ahaha thanks it sucks that i had to cram it all in one
wait this is Claire Dong right like ur roommate	so hopefully if i write more i won't have to provide like one sentence snippets yeah claire dong
wow y'all are so wholesome perks of a quad thanks so much for sharing with me i can't wait to read more heh	ahah you're very welcome i am actually super grateful for you tho alex realizing how much time i spend with these hoes like
do you have any siblings at home to hang with	yeah i have a little brother who is 13 and going through pubescent teenager things rn victor fu i'm self isolating rn tho and he's pissy all the time so i haven't said more then 3 words to him since i got home lmfao
omg oof ahh yes the classic teenage phase	lol he'll be alright tho he allso just stopped having the flu so that could be a reason
how's the quarantine	i'm on season 2 episode 11 of the good place and yesterday i was halfway through season 1
Omg Loool What is of the good place	? like what is it about?
Ya is it worth embarking on a new tv show	yes it is it's really good it's about this girl named eleanor shellstrop who gets sent to this place called the good place after she dies but it's more complicated than it seems and that's about as much as i can give without spoilers
:O i will check it out	ahaha
F I’m already halfway through season 1 what have u done	YESSSSSS I'm so happy you're watching it
lol what else is there to do in quarantine	nothing ig i finished the whole show like a day or two ago
all three seasons? insane	yes lmao it's only like 4 hours each season
also i just realized that 006 isn't going to have any review before the quiz :o	:(((( I have already forgotten all of 006 sadly
lol if i did review for people over zoom do u think ppl would come	Me I would I think a lot of people would But Won't u not be home for a while
i mean ill in vegas for a hot minute i won't be home for a bit so also i don't think i can make it official because spring break so idk what to do but it also seems like lowkey trolling to have you guys take the exam with no review	yeah eek idk alex whyyyyy is it 5pmmmm
i had no choice!!! wait are u on EST	yes it's pm est right 5pm
yah </3	omgggg sad i still signed up for that one tho T.T i'll just end school later it's fine how r u tho
<3 im ok! quarantine period is almost over almost done with season 1 of the good place just standard stuff hbu	are u driving back eh i'm alright my task list keeps piling up should probably start studying for 006 eek fantastic
ya this spring break really doesn't feel like a break tbh im driving home at some point! idk when yet though sigh	yeah i have so much stuff due on the 30th this makes no sense be safeeee
have you gone out at all or just chillin at home	nope lilterally left the house once to take a walk and that was the only time
oof Michigan is lowkey kinda scary aren't cases climbing like crazy over there	yeppp
it's ok in a week you'll be hosed with schoolwork anyways	lmao ikr i'm actually feeling like i'm going to be thrown back into it school and life that is but there will be so many distractions at home now like food and my bed
Literally same bed working from bed is so comfortable but so not productive What have you been doing to keep busy?	Uhhhh I mostly sleep half my day away But you're right I can't raise my productivity Sometimes when I do one thing I feel so accomplished
This is a mood, I miss playing tennis so much	:(( I haven't exercised in like 3 weeks
same quarantine is going to make everybody in the US fat	:((( already there alex i have a question about 006 on the fall 2019 exam there is this question and i don't understand why the number of arithmetic operations isn't just O(1) time regardless of when there's an exponent and i also don't understand the precomputing part i tried to use a set avl tree but in the list of common mistakes it says u need to augment by size
if the exponent is large enough, the number gets so big you can't just perform random operations on it e.g. calculating 2^n for some n definitely does not take O(1) right if you're using a Set AVL, are you keying by the point value?	i was going to calculate the value and key by that also these answers are not as simple as i thought wtf i thought the structures were so simple but alas they were not i'm so fucked lmao
Loool you’re not! You just need more practice Generally when you see a problem that has a bound like this one you want to think radix sort.	do you assume exponents take log n to calculate then depending on what the exponent is? like the 23lgn bound?
yes in response to the bound question for exponents, it depends on the exponent 2^4 is O(1) to calculate :P slash how you do the exponentiation  x^n takes O(n) to compute naively right	yes
x^lgn takes lg n to compute naively (which is where this problem got its bound)	oh i see
does that make sense	i think so but why is it 2 + 23lgn as c do u just assume 3 is n to upper bound oh wait no it's 23lg3 ah i see u can swap the n and 3
yea	math ugh
and then add 2 bc b^2 n^2***	yeah
ya math is hard :P	:(( your recitation filled again lmfao
yeah i know i don't know a lot of the kids again	oh wait it's different kids?
lowkey kinda got attached to my existing classes	i thought most people would try to stay lol EQ is doing a midnight recitation that's crazy
yeah but higher cap now + i think ppl didn't realize you had to sign up yeah LOL rip it's to get all timezones	oh i see ripppp is he at least like pst
i think he's in chicago?	eek that's not much better ha is there a reason i shouldn't use a set AVL tree other than the fact that inserting would take like log n time
that's mostly it i mean it works, but it takes nlogn	right so if you don't precompute using radix also takes nlogn but precomputing gives you n time and even if you precomputed for a set AVL tree you'd still take log n to insert ok i just explained this to myself thankks lmao
yaaa gjgj	ahaha OH BTW i finally did the pure storage hackerrank i think it was out of their timeline but i sent them an email afterwards to apologize and they said they'd still look at my results and lmk idk if my parents will let me go to california if i get it but i'm getting ahead of myself
yay! good luck :D how did it go i think they were considering moving their internship virtual my recruiter from PS snapchatted me the other day to ask if I knew of other companies going virtual	uhhhh it wasn't that easy but ik i passed all the coding stuff the mc was similar to some 004 stuff which was really fortunate wow you snapchat your recruiter????? it was a time crunch tho
Carolyn and I are super tight	that's awesome haha
it's ok! I struggled a reasonable amount on it too when i took it iirc :D lmk did FB get back to you? i think they're currently swamped with figuring out this pandemic situation	yerrpp no i haven't gotten any communication from them yet haha
hmm ok well we'll see	for problem 6 alex the answer key says to use a two finger alg and sort in nlogn so first of all why can't you use radix sort to do the sorting in n time and second of all i didn't use two finger alg i just inserted into a set avl tree for each stick in L keyed by length and do a search from root in logn time for some l multiplied by the current one that is >= T and as soon as u hit it you store it in some global min value that you use to compare as u add sticks and so there's like n sticks and logn time for each like insert and comparison things anyways ig like is there only one right answer to these things because i didn't think to use the two finger thingie
sometimes not, let me read through your answer again radix sort can't be done bc the sticks arent bounded	okie haha sorry that was a lot
"""and do a search from root in logn time for some l multiplied by the current one that is >= T"" im having a hard time understanding this what is the current one? oh i see you do this for every stick"	uhhhh yes
HmmmMMMMM that's creative i think that works?	uhhhh idk it was the first thing i thought of but like it's confusing ig sorry one more question so how does the bounding for radix sort work again like the range of values for which the lengths can exist must be n^c where n is the number sticks there are is that a correct understanding of it?
"yeah that's right umm so i think your solution works, let me think about it some more my main gripe with it is like if we had given you the sorted array to begin with a two finger alg runs in O(n) but your solution runs in O(nlogn) so it's a bit worse I'll be talking a bit about how to recognize two finger alg problems tomorrow on Zoom, but basically you know it's a two finger when you're trying to ""optimize"" something over two variables"	ohhhh right yeah because i assumed there needs to be some sorting done i guess if they did give the lengths sorted i might have thought differently
yeah	by putting it into the set avl tree i think i was trying to search as i was sorting wait when are you on zoom tomorrow???? oh right your email wait r u just talking like virtual oh or is it the review thing u sent to our recitations
review thing	"oh did i miss an email from you ""the exam, and just happened to let other students/friends know the zoom link with which we were all studying together... there's no course policy against that, so uh, let me know if that's something you guys are interested in over the next week or so (no pressure!)

Also, we'll be trying to do virtual OH or something over the next week, not sure how that'll work yet, but I imagine details will be coming from instructors soon.
"" this is what i have from you"
yaaa i made a zoom link for people who were interested and replied i can't send it to everyone tho because then itll be course official lmao	OOPS CAN U SEND IT TO ME AND WHAT TIME i didn't reply cuz i was like i text this guy like every other day
LMAO	BUT THEN I JUST
here ill invite u	"DIDN""T REPLY"
hmu with ur gmail	jamie.fu@gmail.com bless
wtf lucky	ikr so good
imagine if i had alex.chen@gmail what a dream	my dad got it for me when i was born isn't that funny like when i was a kid he was like
omg	better snatch that gmail
what a champ	can u believe
truly a visionary	literally i'm only fighting with like 3 or 4 other prominent jamie fus out there tho
lmao there were 4 alex chens at mit rip	Eek Did u send the invite
yeah i did! i think? oh oops i didnt save classic	Okie I got it Tyty
yeeeeeppp im also going to be a mess bc this is my first time doing stuff over zoom	You got ittt
lmao check out this slick document i wrote for myself when i took 6.006 i think i must've been trying to make a doc for things to study and ended up giving up after one thing	LOL Omfg That's so good Agree Building heaps
o man that roasted my voice i think we spent too long on Alien Arrival tho that was a tough question	You worked hard!! Honestly I thought some of the stuff on fall 2019 was harder Was there anything else u wanted to go over
i mean i wanted to go through a lot more but it's hard to with limited time i think people in general were pretty confused by Alien Arrival tho so like just recursive shit on AVLs is so weird at first	Yeah that's facts Ugh I don't even know what I don't know
hahah you'll be fineee do you have any other exams next wk	Not next week but the week after
oh okie well at least you have time	Yee I haven't even started studying for the other stuff yet
haha what did you think about today	Pretty good I don't think it was meant to be exhaustive But the content u covered was thorough
how do we feel about format	Wait what format Of the quiz?
im still inbetween having students say stuff and having students chat	Ohhh Saying would be more interactive But it's so hard to do over zoom
yeah do you think people are like more likely to say stuff if it was interactive	It's hard because nobody wants to say something at the same time as someone else Or say anything at all ig Chat allows more people to talk Probably
hrmmmm yeah you know how sometimes i asked for people to answer a small question and stuff it feels super awk because latency = i have to wait like a hot minute for people to get the message, then type, and then for the message to come back to me lmao	oh lmao yeah on our end it didn't feel like the latency was that bad when u ask teh question it's not like late or anything it's just everybody i thinking
ok so it wasnt awk it felt awk on my end	i guess since you have to b the one talkinig it's awkward
Yeah	i think i've asked you before but you can't hash an object to some daa or hash table and have that point to another hash table or daa right
ummm like a nested hash table> ? that's fine	oh do u remember when we were doing that pset question in building 7 and like you were like you can't put a dictionary mapping to a dictionary or smth right
ummm was this the coding	yeah is it just like an implementation thing
yeah this is just a python thing not a theoretical thing	ohhh ok great lmao
:D how's the studying	well tbh i spent today making food reading and playing drawful with my family i just started sp19
yay you deserve the break it's ok pnr :>	idk i feel strangely calm about this LMAO and i really shouldn't
lol you'll be ok	:pp more pnr after pnr
come hang out at OH monday :D	down
with ur fave alex	down
idk how many ppl will be there	what time r u doing
there was 1 kid	i'll just
today	sit in quietly right LMAO
lol	it's a saturday!
that's fair looool my OH is 2-4 EDT	please tell me you did something fun okay i'll go on monday
yay	LMAO jk wait i have 004 OH then
LOL ok jk	should i change my hours
looooool	since i don't really hae lec anymore i can do 004 OH when i want right hmmm
ask terman oh wait terman doesn't teach it anymore	who's termna
:< he used to teach 004	oh yeah silvina is our lecturer now
oh yeah she took weblab	i feel like i've heard of him now
lmao	tho*
yeah he was a legend	eek yeah imo 004 is much easier now BUT the book i'm reading right now mentioned a lot of things i actually understood because of 004 i was actually so fucking impressed i was like maybe this class actually taught me smth
:OOOO what book??	The Three-Body Problem by Cixin Liu
omfg ive been meaning to read that	hack is trying to do a book club as a social activity i was only supposed to read up to ch 11 for this sunday but i'm already at like 27 lmao
wooow it's that good>?	it's like strange and sometimes creepy but like it just feeds into my existentialism it's like one of the weirdest sci fi things i've ever read and like more technical than i realized but i don't have a really good understanding of the stuff they discuss so idek if what they're saying even makes sense generally but sounds cool well it's sci fi too so obviously a lot of it doesn't have to be justified OMG WOW i just realized something well i just looked it up but i watched this chinese movie called the wandering earth a while ago and the entire time i was reading this book i was getting like the wandering earth vibes and i just looked it up and it turns out the author of this book also wrote the story that the wandering earth was based on HOLY
i've been meaning to read it for a while	u should definitely read it it's really interesting not sure if this will be useful for your recitations or oh or whatever but on zoom u can set shortcuts to your personal meeting room like this my/jamiefu will redirect to my id oops idk why that sent again
ooooh wait that's super nice hm maybe we should change our doc	yeah ikr we had to do it for 036 but
putting a string in is pretty annoying	it's so convenient
ill let the instructors know :>	yeeee
how goes wknd? ive been so lazy all day	uhhhh same i made dalgona coffee today tho and kimchi fried rice basically procrastinating here's the coffee tho
Omfg so artsy	Ehe portrait mode
that coffee actually looks really good im gonna need some on my drive back to cali..	It's so easy to make It's just like u whip 1 part instant coffee 1 part sugar and 1 part water And then u whip it until it's foamy like that And put it on top a cup of milk
that's like saying here's how to fly a plane: 1. turn it on 2. fly it :P	LMAO actually that's all u need to do alexx for this problem it asks to find a recurrence for smerge_sort
Ya	and says that every level takes nlogn for every level but i'm confused because isn't finding the s and t n time and merging them also n time
Ummm Which year is this	fa18
are u talking about C one s_merge takes O(n) time right	uh yes
ok but like that's one iteration of s_merge like you see how it says find s and t then recursively call s_merge each time you merge two arrays of size n, you need n log n b/c you call s_merge log n times and each one is n	wait what uhhhhh
so like normal merge it takes n right	yes
you just merge the two arrays together here they're like ok this is s_merge	wait
we use O(n) to find s and t	wdym by merge the two arrays together
ummm like in merge sort	like you have to compare things
yeah	one by one
yeah	ok yeah
it's O(n) right	yeah
ok so s_merge it's like first let's merge half of the arrays (up to n/2 elements) and then recursively call s_merge on the remainder	oh fuck what i'm so confused now i thought it was just doing merge sort on two differently sized arrays
this is a way two merge two already sorted ararys it's not a merge sort (yet) at least before part C like they're trying to substitute this s_merge for the merge step in merge sort	uhhh s_merge is liking merging two separately sized arrays right
sure yeah	ok so it merges the bottom n/2 elements in n time right
"yeah and then it gets recursively called so it merges half of the remainder which is a quarter and on and on log n times each s_merge ""step"" takes n times time* so total it takes n log n"	wait so instead of doing like comparisons from each of the items in the two arrays you have to go all the way down in logn time to make sure there's like only two elements as a base case then go back up? like normal merging doesn't use recursive calls to merge right it just
yeah	takes the two arrays side by side and compares them right the elemtns* elements* why is this a thing
it's not it's dumb	why doesn't it just merge it normally smh
we don't really ask these kinds of questions anymore they're functionally useless there's no reason you'd ever do this	lmao
it's trash lol	LMAO ok i was super confused as to like what the difference was initially because like you could technically also do this smerge on two same sized arrays too right
yeah	ok so that was my confusion i think
and it's like strictly worse	yes indeed
ugh i miss school so much i really wish i could just be back at MIT rn	wait actually i didn't think i was like in love with campus or anything but like last week i had two nights of consecutive dreams both fantasy like but all based on mit campus so fucking weird but i was like mayhaps i like this school
haha m a y b e	anyways dw you'll have a few chances to be back in boston right you'll be in ny right
yeah ill visit a lot ill come to practice :P	yes sir omg that's so sad no more practice w/alex :((
</3 you'll get to see me tho! also ive decided im headed back to cali next weekend :o	Oh yay be safeeee
im gonna be so boreeeed	me in daily life
LOL tru	eek i wanted to wake up at 9 today so i could just see what the 8.02 open oh was like for my lecturer but then i gave up and slept in until 1130
LOL a classi classic how's 004 OH	it was alright tbh i didn't remember half the stuff on the lab i did
lol;	eek
Mood rn I’m pretty tired of being stuck inside	Factual words Can u even go In like A backy@rd Or balcony Or window
we have a backyard haha thankfully	oh good i havent even been in the backyard tbh
arent u done with your quarantine :D	yeah but i just haven't been outside plus my dad is paranoid sinice my county has a lot of cases
oh jeez stay safe.. dude michigan really came in clutch climbing the standings good for u guys :<	:(( Yeah I'm not even sure what's going on i remember you did this problem with our recitation i am confused about how the worst-case sort is O(n+k) though
counting sort takes O(n+u) where u is the largest possible number in this case that's k	uhhh ok wait so the sorting we're doing is basically radix sort though right is radix also O(n+u) and why does counting sort take +u
oh	becuase i thought u were just putting n values in like smth akin to a daa
no so each counting sort takes O(n+u) -> O(n+k) and you do 8 such sorts so O(8(n+k))	"ohhhh so does it take n+k because you have to find the maximum first do build the array like is that where the +k comes from and why does it say ""applying radix sort with a counting sort subroutine"" doesn't radix sort always use the counting sort subroutine on its parts and radix sort is O(n) because the number of possibilities is bounded right by the number of elements we have so isn't the number of possibilities we have technically constant or if they're making the assumption that k << n doesn't that ensure that oh shit jk k isn't the number of possibilities it's the number of digits ok so on the bottom there's this explanation of why you can't use a normal radix sort because it's not exactly bounded by n^c because we don't have that the number of possibilities in terms of n and k is the # of possible characters per like spot"
for our purposes yes yeah so k << n so O(k+n) is O(n()	right ok so i reread some stuff online and i think i understand the runtime arg for counting sort now and this just seems like a normal radix sort problem. why are we putting in the +k part when k << n counting sort just requires the # of possibilities to be O(n) right so the subroutine should be okay as a constant right
u don't really need to as in like it simplifies to O(n)	do i need to explain the counting sort subroutine then if it'll just simplify to O(n)
mmm you can probably blackbox the RT of counting sort in your explanations they're just being rigorous here	ohh there's that whole thing about 36^8 thing though
yeah that's like u can't just counting sort it u have to radix sort it	ohhhhh
:)	f alex F thanks for always helping me lol i spam u a lot :pp
that's what friends/TAs are for lol	<3333
How goes it	the studying? ehhhh i said i was gonna study but i just glanced through some of the problems inyour drive folder so i think that's about my limit lmao should have done more practice exams but alas 4 is my mental limit at this point in time
Pnr	facts lmao i should appreciate it while i can
True And after tmr you can chill Also I think the avg is gonna be trash ngl Given all that’s happened	well it'll also be way easeier to cheat tho which is the problem well i realized today i have like 5 things due by sunday one of which is the pset lmao which i haven't watched the lec for yet
Oh nooooo	ikkkkk my weekend destroyed
It’s ok u have time Also It’s hard to cheat on this exam	it's so hard to work at home my parents always here and there
True haha, but hopefully your internet is ok?	Yes the internet is fine The distractions are less fine but honestly nbd I just lack Self control
lol word last minute tip don't forget to analyze correctness and runtime for every question even if it's a hand wavey thing unless it's like a conceptual question so like for all your algo algo questions those two steps are free points if you get the question right augmentations are of the subtree eom	oh yessss thank you alexxxxx
you're gonna kill it!	kill it or get killed excited for this to be d o n e
Giving rec over zoom is so weird	haha how'd your second one go it was great though You had twice the number of kids in your recitation than you had spots for lol
lol second one was ok, my throat was pretty dead by the end somehow i feel like this is harder than just teaching on a board i have to be more engaging because it's so easy to space out lmao yeah that was pretty troll idk if it's too many	your own expectations are so high omg yeah probably and u can't point to things what did u do about your apple pencil lol
i switched with rachel lmao and just mooched hers i should probs charge mine next time beforehand..	aye nice oh i forgot to let u know but i am sorry to say that pure storage did not invite me for an interview it'll be aight tho
awwww sorry their loss <3	aha thanks alex
it's a weird time tho i think most places are cutting their hiring	yeah my mom also told me ford was like not doing their hiring cycle anymroe but if boston is better by the summer maybe i could be uroping there or i could also just stay at home and chill and learn some interesting things i
yeah lots of good options	am on a personal quest to be a more interesting person
if ur in boston and things are good again ill come visit you :)	because i have no hobbies i realized oh yes that would be wonderful
lmao im pretty sure tennis counts..	well yes aside for tennis ok so here's my list of things 1. learn guitar 2. learn react 3. read more like actual literature 4. make a personal website that kind of goes along w react i suppose ok yeah that's it guitar has been fun so far but it's actually so much prac to just do anything half decently it's so hard
love it blog more i wanna read more of your thoughts :P yeah guitar is hard at first esp bar chords also learn react!!! i love react <3 build ur personal website in react lmao	oh yes i totally should i forgot about it i wrote one more blurb about my week in quarantine which ended up being a tv show/movie list yeah the f chord has kind of been not good for me idk there's so many ways to play it and i haven't figured out the one that i can do easily yet because they're all hard actually that was the idea
practice barring with a capo first makes it a lot easier also im on season 3 of good place	yessssss how has it been so far oh like try doing the barre and having the capo there alas i don't own one atm my guitar is also like not a full size guitar bc and i just have it bc my mom bought it off my preschool teacher many years back
lol when i first started playing guitar i built a capo using a pencil and a few rubber bands yeah like put capo on 4th fret and bar on 5th it's a lot easier than barring on fret 1 it's good! Wait are u don done with good place lol	ohhhhhhh dude i finished the thing lilke 3 days into quarantine excellent episodes in season 4
lmao... ok i have to catch up	yessir did u figure out your thesis stuff and research alex for #4 on the pset i'm debating with jianna atm are the edges the grid lines and the nodes the grid intersections or are the edges the linkages between squares and the squares the nodes
Yeah gutsy Yeah that sounds right Oh Wait Is this Rivers	yes wait which one sounds right
Ummm I think we’re looking for the former But lemme Look and check	ok tysm also i didn't hear your answer about your thesis yet bc i asked u a q please do answer it tho i am curious
Oh oop I often do this thing where I like only read the most recent message Hahahaha Thesis is... eh I think my lab will let me grad I hope Ok yeah looks like we’re asking for intersections And this makes sense because our path goes to and from an intersection	well they better ok so u have to process the squares adjacent to some intersection right
Ok staff is arguing rn about this lmfao	are u still doing stuff for it lmao jianna was very adamant because apparently shreyas told her something
Looool yeah Shreyas and I are discussing this	win alex win! not that it's a fight
So I assume you’re on team intersections	:o yes lmao even though it's harder i just spent like half an hour trying to convince jianna and pulled up screenshots of the pset too so i can't go back now
LOL	i pulled out the records alex do u know what the means????? my dignity is at stake! my pride! i've put everything on the line
omFG no pressure to your dear TA or anything Jk	;)))) lol honestly if it ended up being shreya's way wouldn't that be significantly easier
Ok intersections win Lol Yeah I’m still working on it tho I should start writing soon probs	i feel simultaneously saved and devastated oh goodie am i allowed to read any portion of ti or is it confidential
Loooool do you really want to read it	certainly it was so interesting when u described it
Heh okay when I write it I can’t believe we’ve already been away three weeks	I kmow It feels so weird
Is it still cold there	I was overjoyed at our midday 56 degree weather So Moderately yes But it's not snowing
Wait that sounds so nice	Yeah it's Nice these past few days
My allergies make me sad in the spring :’(	:((( relatable but it's actually not bad rn probably in vegas or cali tho
yeaaaahhh ugh im gonna be so tired tomorrow i dont wanna driveeee save me	are u driving tomorrow? how long is the drive also do we need to specify e and a run in our runtimes anymore for like a python implementation u should have like a visited set right so that would be like e time to check for existence in a set sorry let me amend this statement like if we need to make an adjacency dict for a set of edges the problem provides we should include the e in our runtime to make that right
Yeah but that’s like Within E+ V So it’s fine	oh ok so we should still write it doesn't it make our runtime expected then and should we say that it's now expected
For this unit You can just say like create a graph G You don’t really need to specify too much Expected doesn’t really matter	oh ok great so creating the graph is like greating the adjacency dict essentially right also i have  a question about runtime for 6 i'm trying to do the coding for it and i don't really want to do it recursively but not but so i'm maintaining a list of moves for every single op but i think that may be the thing slowing runtime which is a bit of an F but im also not sure
Ummm that... should be ok Do you memoize	Lol it worked I was just adding to the visited set too late
Looool nice	yeah lol for #3, how much are we allowed to alter dfs and bfs for example can we just keep track of the length of the path so far aka level of a node as we traverse
Bfs does that by default	oh wait really i'm not sure how much capability bfs and dfs both give because there's tons of ways that u can write it to keep track of like path and other things
Yeah mostly black boxable	oh hmm ok so should we not presume that something like dfs can keep track of layers and what about finding the path vs just the length of shortest path also rip i just snapped my top retainer in half on accident
I forgot to talk about this last recitation, you can just say “use parent pointers” And oh noooo :’( rip To get the path instead of length of shortest path	oh i see well sort of
No alg can keep track of layers- you have to make the layers and then run some algorithm on it, so I guess DFS can be used with our layering approach Though it’s a bit odd I suppose to do that	so for number three about romio 0 and julie 8 like can i say store the levels as u perform bfs
Yeah that actually works you can do that	oh gr8
You have to explain why tho Like why this approach works	why you can store the levels? or why using levels works
Why storing the levels helps you solve the problem	oh yes when i draw a bfs or dfs traversal for 1 i shouldn't repeat nodes right like i don't have to account for all edges right so once i've visited a node once if there's another eddge to it from something else i don't have to draw it right
Ya Don’t draw it	Okie yay I submitted it last night at 3am after latexing it all evening and honestly I can't even remember if what I wrote was coherent
looool pnr	Lol I was reading it like I can't process this For proof of correctness can I just I made the graph right so bfs will do it right
yeah like talk abou twhy the shortet path here is the answer	Ohhh ok alex where are youuuu
Lol I was still prepping at 55 oof	Haha we were sad and lonely Bois without u
lol how are you how is home	i should be asking you that question i have been steadily gaining weight not a good look literallly
wtf i feel like i gain weight at school like, buffet everyday?	what bro you're trolling dining hall food is not a buffet plus sometimes u don't have time to eat whe you'r ein school here food is around me 100% of the time
LOL ok that's fair	how's you doing btw i totally forgot u just recently drove back u all unpacked and stuff?
yeah it was tiring	:((
yeah, in the process life is tough	i was about to ask you why you're still up and then i was like
lol it's 9 :P	oh it's 9pm
why are y o u still up	LOL :((( be like that
yeah	uh i had a p full day today it was
tell me about it!!! what did you do :)	"ok wait so my day doesn't usually start until 11am because that is the earliest i can possibly wake up rip my 930am lab tmrw last week was torture i had to take a nap after lab ended cuz i was so tired but anywayssss i did 004 OH from 11-1 then i had about an hour to finish up my 8.02 learning sequences which suck ass btw then from 2-4 ish i was doing ""virtual spring career fair"" which was people telling me no they don't have a job for me and then from 4-5 i actually had a nice break i went outside in the backyard w my mom and brother and we j chilled 5-6 your recitation 6-8 was project proposal emergency meeting for 6.08 lol it ended up going until 9pm tho f oh wait no it went until 840 at 9pm ish i started researching some things for the company i had an interview with later that night 930pm-1030 supposedly but really 1010pm was a hack cpw meeting then 11pm i had the interview but it ended up being really short like 1130 35 pm i was done they didn't have many questions lol"
which company? that's great! interviews are the first step	a bank in taiwan it's for misti china which is
:O wao	cancelled atm
ohhh i see lol wut so is it ???? question mark	so idk why they're doing this it's like in case ig
yeah makes sense	the director of the thing just keeps planning things so i'm like aight whatever u say
hahaha well at least you're keeping busy miss ya, wish we were back at school	am i????? am i????????? i miss u too friendo and sameee
yeah life here is pretty rough but alas i wonder if by summer it'll clear up	alas yeah hopefully
i think it's more likely to not though we'll see it's such bad timing idk like my mom has to be in and out of the hospital so much nowadays	:(((( you're right it's bad timing we 'll get through it we'll all get through it together
yeah how goes your guitar adventures	oh i haven't played in a while for some reason the weeks have been getting busierrr
hahahah it certainly feels that way i overslept my meeting oop i sleep so much now	Oop Sleeping is good tho
yeah sleep > lab meeting i have OH today oof	Agrer Oop Should probably start the pset
LOL dont forget you have late days tho	There's a lot of psets left tho right Wait is it two late days total And u have to use them all at the same time
"i think it's two ""late passes:' "" each of which is 48 hr extension? i forget exactly"	Oh right Yeah that sounds accurate
do you still have 004 OH today	It's Mon Wed U freaked me out for a second I was like Wait Do I?
oh wait for some reason i thought it conflicted with my OH ohhhh wait i guess it conflicts on quiz weeks? idek schedule is all messed up now	that was before i thought wait i can't remember now plus you told me you're always staffing different OHs every week
lol yeah it depends on whether there's a quiz on non quiz wks im R F S	oooh Your mom and I have the same birthday
omg really?? :O what a coincidence	Coincidink Yeah I saw after your tagged your parents in the confession lol
hahahah	AC confessions are the best ;) So wholesome
hahahah omg im constantly flattered by confessions idk who these people are	Your students bro!!!!
My students are too nice to me Also wtf why you awake woman	THEYRE REALLY NOT Also idk It was a bad idea
I’m not ready for rec today oof	lies you're definitely ready you're always over ready
What is Johnson	i'm hoping you'll teach me that since i need it for #6 lol
Looool How is pset going btw	i actually did 1-5 all yesterday lmao i haven't latexed anything though
Wooooow True “chad”	Idk man It could be iffy
jamie im literally so lazy i need to write my thesis can you write it for me	hi there alex me too uhhhhhh uhhhhhhhhhhhhhh idk about that one sir
im so much less productive at home wtf is this lol	been feeling like this since a month ago lo
i feel like i should pick up a new hobby	what r u thinking of my hobby is sleeping
hmmm	you should sleep more
hahAHAHA DUDE last night i slept like 10 hours dont @ me something i can do inside... like knitting or tetris	Niceeee Omg You really are old We have a generation gap It's over
lmao i feel like that's actually false i probably identify closer with you than with people 3 years older than me	OK for the most part yes But how dare u suggest knitting
HAHA	Youre keeping w it tho Got the fancy slang and all
omfg im not that old	Ehehehe I'm just messin OK do u like video games
i play some video games im not particularly good i spent most of my video game formative years studying for the SAT tbh	Lol same Oh no Oh noo
hahahahah	To be fair tho if I was actually good at video games I would play them a lot more and then I would also probably not be at mit
LOL what do you play	Nothing anymore I used to play a little black ops 2 w my daf dad I have this tendency to not like Actually move when I play tho
holy shit lol i used to play call of duty	So I just stand there Even smash too I push thin air before realizing I need to moce move
c a m p e r	Eek
hahaha	Literally spamming right b
smash is so hard i never really got too into it i played a fair amount of sc2 and league	What's sc2 League is the one yeah it's such a time sink There's only that many moves and People can just use them in all sorts of ways
"this is very true but it is quite fun to mess around with friends on sc2 is starcraft 2! I'm actually not terrible at starcraft, a few friends from FB dragged me into it during our internship hahaha but i mean in a quarantine i guess it's the best time to get back into it wait fk we started this conversation with ""productivity is so much lower at home"" f"	LOL Well You wanted hobbies! Sorry I'm out here being a bad influence You could have done something wholesome Like Knitting
Lmao it’s ok we can be bad influences on each other Games sound fun 1v1 me in black ops 2	Bettt
I stayed up until 2 last night mistakes were made	oh damn yeah same lmao
Wait so if you did misti would it be with tencent	yeah probably i had an offer from them earlier on in the spring but i turned them down for smurf and bc i thought corona was p bad there atm
Ahh right	yeah f
ugh i hope things clear up dude i wanna start work lmao ok i posted	on instagram? on facebook wait what did u post
oops	me too
wrong chat haha	lmao aight
i was unsure about how to respond to a confession and was soliciting advice from my friendos who are m a r k e d l y less awkward than me	LOL you aren't awkward and aren't u lucky to have so many confessions to respond to!
hahahah yeah i'm actually so blessed people in our rec are pretty funny i'm lucky they write nice things about me instead of flaming me :P	it's actually more fun than i expect in rec
hahaha i love our recitations getting memed on confessions is actually quite flattering, despite the fact that i sometimes complain about it jokingly though often i have no idea how to respond but zoom actually works quite well i can use like colors and stuff lol	ik you're a big fan of the colors lol
it keeps people awake lol	lol it's nice these days i really want a notetaking tablet thing too the remarkable 2 is coming out soon so i wanted that but it's like not really worth it
do you just do paper rn	ye this big ass 5 subject notebook
old school and classic i like it	lol yeah actually i'm kind of used to paper so i'm not sure if switching to a tablet would create more distractions
lol yeah i felt the same way and then i just stopped taking notes at some point or tried to do the whole laptop notes thing	lol yeah i'm not sure my dad's watching them tho to see if they go on sale
Haha quarantine is the perfect time to shop I bought new running shoes	ayeeeee i haven't done running in a long time
Same I feel like if I buy shoes I force myself to run :p Though uh Idk about that I’m currently lazing on a couch	wait what are the really fancy white shoes called
Lol wut	they're basically like stan smiths without the green they're so expensive i can't remember what they're called anymore
You’re asking the wrong guy my fashion consists of web lab shirts remember	OH COMMON PROJECTS they're called common projects and your class jacket
Ok this is just recently because my class jacket is “I’m in my pjs and want to laze around all day” jacket Which is every day now...	lol i have been in pjs all day sad life
i teach our rec in PJs hahahah	That's the move bro
hahaha it's ok i don't think anyone notices we're almost done with 006!	honestly how could u even notice oof we are?
Ya we’re on the last unit!! How are your other classes	Oh shoot Eh ts alright Not really vibin
Aww :’(	yeah 8.02 is a pain and everything is prerecorded so my life has very little structure atm
That’s good tho right More time for other things	well i spend the more time for other things usually on youtube or sleepign
hahah what do you watch on youtube	i watch a lot of like korean or chinese tv lol my dad just started watching 11.22.63 last night too i watch cooking asmr lol
what in the world is cooking asmr	i used to be really into bob ross too
hahaha	ok so there are somme videos that are strictly cooking asmr i watch more of that now but i started by watching like chinese nature cooking here let me send u a link it's so relaxing
okiiii enlighten me	 that's one of her older videos i'm trying to find the one where she makes the stove
oooh these are the videos where people like live off the land	
very rustic	yeah it's great she does everything like traditional style
her skin is like flawless lmao also the cinematography is beautiful	I KNKOW it's so aesthetic
ive started watching a lot of cooking videos latel y haha	i don't realy lilke cooking that much but watching cooking videos is really fun
Haha ya cooking is hard Learning how to do so is a struggle But I feel like it’s a good skill to have	wait yeah i definitely think i need to learn how to cook i just don't wanna lol it takes so much time
It’s fun with friends tho!!! And you can make pretty things Though baking is better for that haha	wait ngl idrc if the food looks good so whenever i bake i'm just like this is a lot of butter and sugar and unhealthly but as long as it tastes good and i think fondant is kind of gross
omg yeah i always pick it off my cakes ever since i was a kid lol im trying to take up baking again! though so is everybody i think just quarantine things	you had fondant on your cakes when you were little? i didn't even know it was a thing until i saw it in fb videos yeah ikr i made snickerdoodles the other day but really they were just sugar cookies because i had no cinnamon
yeah isn't it used for like making the cake themed and stuff ya know all the colors and stuff my mom was always like that stuff is waaaayyy too unhealthy because it's pure sugars and colors lol	Sometimes but isn't that mostly frosting Wait it totally is so bad for u Lol I may have just submitted an incredibly memey answer to that survey
Awww thanks friendo Memey answer lmao whatever I’m not getting hired next sem anyways :p How memey	no the video was all honest answers my other answers were like memey come up with a name for a new character in our pset alas the classic kason ju made an appearance extra notes: rip quiz 1 problem 9 my essay was in vain
yeah i figured those were not the memey answers hahaha yeah tbh feels a bit late for a midterm survey	lol ikr rip
Hahah I’m excited to see results Wait did you decide to stay in maseeh next year	Yeaaa Can't deny the convenience
ugh true im gonna miss MIT so much	:((((( mit will miss u too
wait also i realized we never wrapped up our fondant convo i literally thought frosting and fondant were the same thing	WHAT omg no what
LOL am i trolling  ok they're comparable wait are they not the same thing?? i thought fondant was the stuff they put on the cakes to make like flowers and stuff	nooooo that's frosting fondant is like that play dough clay shit people use to wrap around cakes and make it look lilke a smooth piece of plastic
damn are you a baking expert or what	waHT no sir but i can't believe u didnt' know what fondant was that's crazy
lol im u n c u l t u r e d	Agree
Angry >:( Should I do a q2 review like last time	ehe oh shoot i never answered your question i just said ehe yes review would be amazing also i'm probably going to ask u a lot of dp questions bc 1. i forgot to watch lec before today's rec so it kind of flew over my head today 2. after i watch it i presume i still won't understand a lot of things also petition to put kason ju on the next pset
rip DP is super confusing i wish i had more time to intro it but unfortunately the course kinda just throws u guys into the ocean it's ok we will figure something out ask me questions whenever!!!	haha ok tyty
Omfg haha I got the coronavirus check	wait like u got tested ?
Nooo like The IRS gave out money to people Right	OHHHH omfg I totally didn't realize that was what u were saying
LOL ok yeah my words were misleading I was just so surprised wtf Like the actually just straight direct deposited money into people’s bank accounts Wild	Yeah actually that is weird to think about
Hah yeah Also are you seeing this 046 drama	i saw some stuff on confessions
yeah it's wild i think if we had given you guys the exam as a takehome we wouldve had similar complaints	it's like a 3-5 hour exam i heard? i guess that could be p wild
yeah that's true ours are shorter 046 was a time are you taking it next sem	uh if there's school then yes lmao otherwsie the only thing i'll be taking is a gap semester probably
what are you going to do in gap sem? that'd be really fun!	maybeeee eh it could be i'm not thinking of doing anythign i just don't want to be online schooled anymore
that's fair you can come to NY with me :>	do u think ny will be good by then wait is there not recitation on wednesday
no recitation! lol most likely not i think im remote for the forseeable future	aight cool oh oof that's safer tho legit i heard fall semester being not a thing is ahigh probability
ya same :/	this is a big rip i am about to start my #third prac quiz T.T 004 OH was hell today there was like persistently 9 people on the queue at a time and i couldn't figure out this one girl's code and i had to switch with the other uta on OH there were like
awww :(	two really silly errors and i didn't catch them lol
it's ok happens to everyone	also whenever we do lab checkoffs sometimes i have no idea what the lab questions are even talking about like i totally forgot why some of them are the case there werre these 4 runtime questions LOL and i didn't understand how they got the recurrence to be fair the kids aren't supposed to know it but i was like nice i don't get this either anyways i was gonna study today but then OH was packed and i forgot about my 8.02 pset due tmrw so i had to do all that oop so that is why i am only starting now lol
you'll be fineee you could probably punt the exam and still pass the class let's be real	please sir don't make me lazier than i already am also so we have three quizzes and a final right waow
ya but they decrease in weight	ye i suppose that's nice
do not stress fam	i'm doing alright lol but i'm just worried my quality of understanding/learning is significantly decreased after coming home lol it'll be aight
hahaha same with everyone productivity at home is so rip also what is going on in michigan rn	it's snowing
people protesting and stuff?	oh
LOL WHAT	yeah that too
are you srs	yeah
it's april hello	it hasn't in a couple days
late... april?	but for like 4 or 5 days
damn	it was snowing yeah it's great
that's wild it's so hot here	the weather just does whatever it wants here dude that sounds amazing
cali perks	be like that
tho tbh if it was snowing i could just curl up inside all day	but i thought it was interesting
doesn't sound too bad	it was really pretty one of the trees in our backyard was flowering and that with snow was cool
nature is quite pretty im excited for quarantine to end so i can go out and explore some more	"thata's what everyone is trying to do ever since quarantine lol have u seen those things that are like ""people who haven't run since birth:"" insert picture of crowd outside running*"
omfg i feel personally attacked running is hard	eheh wait facts i haven't run a full mile since 9th grade
it's ok u don't need to run a mile for tennis	dude that's exactly what that is my sport of choice why else would i eXerCIsE alex how does full dfs work like if i have a directed graph and i run full dfs on it am i still guaranteed to find all connected components properly and i can augment that feature right
Yeah you can just say run full dfs find connected components Usually you do full dfs By either connecting a super node to everything And running dfs from super node Or you just choose randomly And run dfs	oh got it huh
When you get stuck Repeat	yeah that makes sense
Both algs allow you to know when you’re starting on a new connected component But ya Just black box is fine	oh goodie also i saw this question on sp18
LOL dont worry about this	oh ok good cuz i got it completely wrong
we didnt really talk about it	so far sp18 is the hardest prac quiz i've taken
i think this quiz is probably on the harder side is my intuition actually idk maybe that's just because my first impression was that it was hard	oh no this one u just took? or sp 18 as in the one we have to take tmrw
Yeah	holy rip ok
I think we made it more straightforward tho	hopefully i'm scared now lol the way i've been doing these prac quizzes is like writing 3 lines about the approach and i make the graph and run the right alg in the mostly right way then i'm like aight i got this
yeah i did that too when i studied for this quiz i actually just straight up read solutions lmao	lmao dude this is what dourmashkin is on all the time he's like do problems and don't look at answers so u learn it so then he assigns 4 learning sequences 1 pset and 1 friday problem solving session a week
l o l	"that reminds me of someone in the water beong like ""halp"" which is coincidentallly how i feel atm nah jk i just like complaining i'll be aight tmrw it's chill lol me reassuring myself like"
you got this just remember that	dfs does not find shrotest path
don't read into the BS too much on problems ok?	oh yes that too
like focus on the graph it makes	ok yee sometimes i don't understand why they give u some piece of information that's pertinent to the graph but then it sort of becomes apparent as u look at the runtime and stuff lol also u can only ever have as many back edges as the # of cycles right
ummmm yes but you might have more cycles than back edges	right if something says there exists exactly one cycle tho that means there's only one back edge which u can remove to make a dag right
ya but the problem with this usually is like which edge do u remove lol	like u mean the back edge or the other one right? this is the problem in specific i'm referring to which had me a little confused but i think i understand
Yeah It’s like There two paths Through the cycle Which one do U take	what do u mean two paths throught he cycle
Bank Snapchat drawing Jank ** There are two paths from one red node to the other Like you either go through the upper part of cycle Or lower	oh rip ok i get it so it's saying u should remove either the edge from middle blue to top left blue or to the bottom left blue and see which gives u the min path to t
Ya	but technically this is not a dag tho right because it's undirected edges
Ya but there’s only one path You can just like DFS	oh because there's only one cycle
Dfs doesn’t find shortest path But it finds A path So	oh
If there’s only one...	it says to relax in order of topo order by dfs tho but like u don't even need to do that right
Yeah you can just get the single path with DFS I think	dude rip so confusing i declare this question my least favorite question
LOL The edges are undirected right	yes
Ya I think that works	so if there's only one path bfs will also work right u jsut have to keep track of the weights too when u run it
Ya You can just reconstruct the path	oh okie btw the pianoguys are giving away a free piano every week
Wtf LOL are you serious That’s amazing	yeah just look them up on youtube the number to text is there it's great
I love the pianoguys	you know what i haven't studied yet today but i've decided i need a break
I’ve been following them since forever	they're great
LOL yesss Do you play piano Are you classic Asian child	i am classic asian child but i stopped after 9th grade i took the michigan level test 10 and stopped to be fair tho i have no more prac quizzes left to take i feel like going back before sp18 is excessive and i am not that dedicated 4 is my limit i'll look at the review questions later but a lot of them were just from sp18
Ya ur probably fine	lowkey i went to bed at almost 5am last night
oof what were u doing till 5	at least a good 2 hours was me on my phone u know that clinton swag album trend going around ig rn
No should I Enlighten me	 u just find your favorite albums and put them on this meme and post it on your story i got tagged in one last night and was conflicted for like over half an hour about what albums to pick i don't really listen to full albums either so it was hard
Hahah what did you end up picking?	ØZI in the back but nobody knows who he is :`)
the only one i recognize is Lauv	broooo ok so let me walk you through it
lol	nct 127's new album neo zone which i actually listen to like 75% of the songs from Ruel's older album Free Time which i listen to like 2 songs from but i feel like i'm going to be listening to more of his songs in the future (+ i have a few others not from that album) Lauv's album which i got into because of my two friends who only llisten to sad music and OZI who has like 1 really popular song but it was so good i just put the entire album on there plus i should probably listen to the rest of his album too it's not bad i gave it a shot yesterday the probelm is i don't listen to albums so i just put like recent artists' albums whose vibes i kinda like rn if u were to really go through like my playlists tho i probably have like 9 songs from khalid's free spirit album but it's not like a bop yanno don't u feel like all of khalid's songs u just throw in the background and simpt o
If I had to listen to a song from your music collection what would you give me	oooh i love doing this also u should do a clinton swag meme too i'm really interested in your music taste also i want to recommend u smth u might like so what is taste like
hmmmm ok ill think about it i listen so much random stuff it's hard to condense down into 4 albums hahahaha i feel like i just grab random songs i like	do u have like a preferred genre
i like chill stuff that melodically interesting	hmm ok will find wait do u listen to 88rising at all  i didn't think too hard but i picked it because i feel like i can't find anything that's the same song type or vibe
Ooo ok I’ll take a look Tbh I listen to like A lot of a cappella music Hahaha	oh hmmmm lolmaybe our msuic taste is really different
LOL have you Ever heard the Vanderbilt melodores They’re so good Or something more mainstream like PTX	i think i saw a couple of their videos on fb
this is nice! Im into it tbh i listen to all kinds of random stuff so im not too picky  Phillip Kim's voice is what i aspire to be	oooooooh oh shit this is so good wait they're so good
ugh i know their blend is just amazing they can even make a 4 person small group sound super full  yeah anyways LOL that's my melodores endorsement they're insane Do you have a fave artist?	no not really lol i listen to a little bit here and there for everything i feel like i don't listen to that much obscure stuff but it's like usually some of the top songs from a lot of diff artists in similar genres
ok yeah that's fair	do u have a fav artist
not really, im not too attached to one artist though i've followed Ed Sheeran for forever just because he's been consistently around i had a kpop phase last year haha I find Lauv to be a really good musician and Charlie Puth	i read this thing that charlie puth tries to make the vocal ranges of his songs like either up or down an octave from what most people can sing which i find to be sus because i cannot sing charlie puth songs i used to be really into kpop too
LOL wait a sec	now i'm really only following llike nct
this man's songs are actually humongous	so i guess i'm still into kpop yeah ik so he's like fake news
do you know charles cornell	no who is this
lol ok so basically i watch a lot of stupid shit on youtube like this: 	what the fuck i'm dying ok first of all why are u sending me funny yt videos right before my quiz
IT'S SO GOOD	second of all this is cold gold
omfg u have 40 minutes dw :P it's beautiful	its so good omg
yeahhhh i know right it's too good for happy birthday	ok but real facts the note at which u start happy birthday is super important because if u start it too high then everybody is fucked at the unnecessary high notes
I think the standard key is F major because you start on C	sorry i'm musically illiterate idk what this means but is that high
depends on which C lol but yeah people usually get screwed on the happy BIRTHday parth part	YES
and then it's just :'(	i do it's very rip
same it ok	lies don't lie to me
singing is hard omg have you seen this like musical IQ test thing circling around	yeah the harvard one? i watched twoset take it they said it's fake news
omg I love twoset they're also so good at like music	ahaha yes eddy's perfect pitch always gets me i'm lilke what how
i really want PP :'( alas cursed i assume you don't have it either then?	No definitely not haha
it's ok u have knowledge of graphs and that's good enough	LOL OK I will carry this sentiment with me Throughout life
lmk how it goes!	will do alright so i never want to think about that again
Omg LOL How was	how was it? uh significantly harder than any of the practice i've done in the past year's exams i've been able to look at a question and generally think up the approach before writing shit down but this time i was writing shit down as i was solving it and i also forgot to include a piece of info in question 1 which is kind of rip it should have been easy oof and the last question was fucking insane lol
Lol what did you figure it out in the end	I mean I feel like I should've just settled for bellman Ford at some point to get partial but I tried to do some graph augmentation like in Johnson's to get a positive edge weight graph And run dijks on it
Yes!!! That’s right!!! Ahhhhh yay I’m so proud of you	Oh shittttt Nice It was ridiculous tho my write-up was probably awful And I forgot to say run dfs on 1 and get rid of extraneous vertices I realized it like 2 seconds after I ran out of time oop
You’re probably fine lol	Otherwise I out an answer for the rest of them the second to last one was a bit iffy
Sounds like you did fineeee Good job	Thanksssssssssss Whew that was a journey Glad it's done
i got really tilted at Jason lol because he named the last question bellman fjord or whatever	ohhhh yeah f he's playing us i used bf for the second to last one so i was hellllla confused when i saw that
I was like Why Why would you confuse the kids On purpose Like wtf Anyways	yeah he's
Lol	hardcore
ugh tmr is grading all day again	oh rip that souunds intense and not fun
rip what are you up to now that exam is over	uh i had a hack meeting and now i'm debating whether or not i should buy a remarkable tablet
Are you officially running HACK now Also did your dad find that sale	Haha I'm co directing hack now Nah I don't think u can find one for the remarkable One of the smaller iPads went on sale the other day but my dad didn't get it I don't think I'm that into the  ecosystem so I probably wouldn't derive as much benefit from. Jt
you mean the apple ecosystem ?	Yes
do u have iphone :O	No I have a moto rip I should get a new phone but Im always hesitant about making big decisions
ugh yeah i feel that	And my dad would probably give me shit for it since he's always about saving da money
that's a good habit to have though learning how to splurge isn't a bad skill either	Well I'm just bad at decision making tbh Also I feel like I don't really need a new phone It'd probably just look and feel a little nicer But Im already used to this thing so it's aight tbh
well that's a good attitude you'll get spoiled at tech internships tho	aha yeah it's like when i tried out spotify premium for 3 months and couldn't let go after that for the last question on the pset does the prices on each day need to be consecutive in the chronological order of prices
ya or like if you pick 2 prices from the same day they need to be decreasing in time order	ah but lilke in the list of prices do they have to be next to each other like p0 p1 p2 if p0 and p2 are like or can i put those on the same day without picking p1
no they don't have to be consecutive as long as they're decreasing and you dont skip days	oh f and u have to fill all n days right damn this is so hard
no not necessarily it's just if you decide to pick prices on day 5 and day 7 you'd better have a price on day 6 too but u don't have to pick one on day 8	oh man so why do the days matter then if i don't have to fill them all
because u can't skip a day like u can't have a bunch of prices on day 5 and then a bunch of prices on day 7 with none on day 6 you need at least one on day 6	but like aren't i looking for the longest subsequence of decreasing prices so can't i just find that and then randomly assign days to them
oh the days are like set a certain price has a certain day u can't control that	oh wait what like on a given day there's k prices? ok that makes sense actually
yeah	and i can select some subset of them
yeah they have to decrease and you can't skip days	like pkj has to be greater than pkj+1 ? like the order the prices appear in in the set have to decrease too/ ?
naw the prices can be in whatever order but u have to pick like decreasing ones like they can increase or decrease in the original prices but you want to be able to like pick prices that decrease does that make sense	ummmmmm so like i can just pick some subset of the prices that appear on day i right but then no matter what subset i choose can't i reorder them to become in strictly decreasing order and then as long as my max is less than my min from the previous day it's like ok?
"oh no you can't reorder stuff so like if you have days like this

[1, 4, 5, 2],
[8, 6, 3, 0],
[10, 12, 14, 11] ah actually that's bad let's do [14, 4, 5, 2],
[8, 6, 3, 0],
[10, 12, 11, 1] you're allowed to do 14, 5, 8, 6, 3, 1 omfg i can't do anything fml"	lmao
you're allowed to do 14, 8, 6, 3, 1***	i think i get what you're trying to say
because it decreases you can't do like 14, 4, 5, because it doesn't decrease you can't do 14, 12, 11, 1 because you skip a day but you can do something like 8, 6, 3, 1 (doesn't include day 1, but doesn't skip a day)	but u can't do something like 14 5 4 2 because that reorders the prices on a particular day right so no reordering allowed
ya	ok
otherwise u just reorder everything	yeah
ya	ummm oof ok so like if u need to keep track of having at least one value per day so u probably need to keep track of days, last price in your current subsequence, and whether or not u still need to include a price for that day right actually idk about the last one but i can't thiknk of a way to make sure u keep track of including a price for each day without noting that
yes — so this is a problem where you care about the last value you picked right remem last rec we had this discussion	yeah
and like a price has an index	yes
so you can get where it is within a day, and also which day it was on just based off of the index right so yea	oh
idk	uh yesh
you can include whatever u want in ur SP i think you'll just find it's extraneous you only need 1 variable the idnex index	hmm ok i think i may have some ideas now ah hm maybe lol idk rip this is hard
think actions	OK so like i is the last index I was at And if I want to include i then the next thing I choose should have a value less than the value at i and it should also be within a day And if I don't want to include it I can pick anything after i
yeah	Hmm alright I'll go with this and see where I can get tmrw Thank u chen
ur welcome jamie fu did everything work out?	with #5??? yeah i couldn't really tell if my answer was correct just by writing the reltion so i just figured it out as i was coding it it turns out i was indeed wrong on a few points but i figured it out
Ah okay good	yeee now i just have to latex it all tmrw
Ah ok	no worries tho it's chuggin along do we need to justify how we create our relation?
Maybe just Tell us why you have these cases	ah yeah i ended up doing that haha it wasn't too bad to write up tbh
Did you go to OH today	no haha should i ahve
Ah okay no I was just curious haha	ehe yeah i just spent most of today latexing it and i submitted it now
Nice nice	we're in the home stretch bois how's the thesis chuggin
Haha I’m taking a bit of a break	good good that's healthy
For the next few days	also i ordered the remarkable i couldn't stop myself
Family is going through a lot Oh that’s great! Splurging is good c:	you all doing okay? take it easy alex
My mother passed away this morning	oh i'm really sorry

Yeah Yeah It’ll be okay	ok i won't bother you anymore make sure you take some time for yourself and don't worry about anything else you're always looking out for others first

Wotb? What’s that	word of tanks blitz lol even tho it's like high ranked on steam idk anyone else that plays it but him and his friends
Do you drive tanks	they'll play like murder mystery and stuff on it too you do indeed drive tanks you can ask my brother about any country's principal tank among others and he can tell you everything about them
Haha I love it What have you been up to b ?*	i actually wasted away an entire day toda i doon't really like studying honestly so since we're kind of getting into final seasons i'm on my last few psets so my to do list looks shorter than usual but it doesn't mean there's less to do yanno like i have to study but it's not on my to do list so i didn't do anything today lol
Hahaha I feel that Can’t believe the year is over	Don't @me I'm not ready
Same Though nothing is gonna change We’re still quarantined F	rip that was hard i already know i flopped one of the problems i hope the curve is really good this time cuz last time i actually answered eveyrthing and still got like 60%
don't worrryyyyy curve carry	really tho no like the curve is going to break it's literal backk trying to carry m and it won't this time because i know i did it wrongggggg T.T
omggg i'm sure you did fine	T.T rip i did not it's fine tho i mean it's not but i feel like i've whined sufficiently
hahahah last exam!!! dont even worry	bro the final bro do even worry
u probably wont even have to take the final chill	i do be worry i am worry lol ok
lmao	i mean i'm hopefully passing by this point
yeah i think you are probs the final isn't worth THAT much	but like i kinda want an A lowkey not even sure if it'll be on internal but like mehh i just feel like all this hard work should go to smth
that's fair oh yeah you might need to report it if ur trynna TA someday	oh i mean i'm not that ambitious i just my lil letter and i'll be trotting along but i'm a little ambitious
lol i thought that when i took this class too but TAing is a blast u should do it also wtf i feel like ur a lottle ambitious like a little but a lot	please 006 will never want me to TA yeha like a lil' but like a lot ig idk i just don't want to flunk this so close
inb4 ur a TA in a couple years lol	whats inb4 ughhhhh woe is me is that froom a movie
lol i think it's just from the internet but dw youll be fine	wait what is inb4 tho
"it's like ""watch this happen""  used on reddit a lot lol do u read reddit"	oh the fuck i feel like in teh recesses of my mind i've seen this but i have never actually experienced it tbh i'm actively avoiding getting sucked into reddit cuz of the inhuman amount of hours i spend on fb and instagram like ig i used to not use as much but recently i've been using the discover feature too much for memes
m e m e s	i think i'm using these social medias wrong tbh i just go to them for memes not like the social the day i'm a TA for 006 will be a strange one indeed i don't hate this class or anything i'm just grossly unqualified ^don't respond to that self-deprecating statements are part of my humor learn to accept it
so i've learned :P	"also my phone has this ""digital wellbeing"" feature which i've been using recently and i thought it wasn't working until today the one day i was supposed to study i reached my timer limit on facebook"
what does digital wellbeing even mean	ok so
oh LOL	you can set timers on apps and i put 30 min ones on fb ig sc and tumblr (all for the memes) and tumblr is the originator of memes and long-winded things to read so i've timed that one out before at like 2 or 3am in teh mroning but those aren't active hours anyays but like i don't really get close on fb or ig and like nonexistent foor sc since that's kind of dead for me
omg can i read ur tumblr	oh wait i don't write on tumblr i'm a smol lurker i had a brief stint when i first got it when i thought i was going to be a literary but tumblr as i've found is not meant for literaries
tru u are a literary, it's so cool that you actually write medium posts and stuff	LOL rip i need to think of something else to write i think i should write about the three body problem book i've been reading that series with a couple kiddos on hack
omg!! i still need to read that thanks for reminding me	that's like the only thing i'm doing aha yes you should it's so good the past 3 days i spent my time binging this the second book a mistake as evidenced by the exam today but worth it ok tbh tho i studied and went through all the DP relevant materials from this semester i just panicked it's on me i am highly type A i'm a fake literary tho like i've seen some people write some really artful stuff i can't quite capture
takes practice i suppose i feel like i've been kind of dropping the ball with my TA duties recently should've prepared my students (including u) more probs	nah u did a really great job i learned dp first from you then lecture lol yeah that's def true
we're done now!!! yay just the final left	The final is the hurdle of all hurdles But yes Home stretch
What’s your plan after school ends Did they get back to y’all about going to Asia	Yeah I'm not going to Asia lol I'll be remote uroping for the summer Xp
Ooooh which lab	Tegmark haha He's a physics professor who's like apparently into NLP research I'm still not done with my current urop tho So probably have to grind that out sometime
Ooooh interesting NLP Damn	We'll see the Prof is kind of weird He's this Swedish guy who is trying to learn chinese So he talks in Chinese to me sometimes
LOL omg Is he any good	Uhhh His accent is good But it's like A lil creepy He sneaks it in from time to time
well at least you'll be home nice and comfortable	Haha yes Gaining weight Nice and comfy at home
i think ive actually lost weight at home lol	nooooo don't lose weight u have to eat well
it's just because like dining is all u can eat	Omg noooo you shouldn't lose weight tho I heard that gaining weight for guys is always harder than losing it
i gotta make a commitment to hit the gym that's the play	Home gym Is the play I don't have the motivation

:P	you're offficially done with all 6.006?
well i still have to grade the final	lol i joined the zoom call and there was nobody there i was like lmao oop
lol oop	oh facts
i need to finish my theSISSSSS	go go go you got this
i met with my thesis advisor today and she said i didn't have enough related work which is sad because related work is h A R D to write	hmm unclear what this means but send when complete! are u going to do like a virtual defense
lol omg are you really going to read my thesis nuuuu it's going to be so bad no we don't need to for masters	damn i would have attended tho dude please let meee it's great ik it
loool ok reluctantly what are you up to lately just studying for finals?	uh i haven't started studying yet today i just chilled had a couple meetings but just chilled  also do u watch twoset i shit myself watching this it's so funny
Omg I love twoset have you seen pachelbel's chicken holy shit i actually haven't seen this video lmao oh wait it just came out today lmao	Lmao wait no I haven't Haha yeah now u know what site I've been on all day
 a classic	This one is one of the funniest I've seen tho
please play this at my wedding	Oh shit wait I have seen that one LMFAO
omg i didn't know making lofi was this easy haha holy this is so interesting	I knowwwww
have you seen Beethoven's Bad Guy	Haha nope I only watch some
hahaha ok ive clearly wasted too much time on YT rip	It's gr8
hihi wanna test something for me	Sureeee What am I testing
it's something im working on can you tell me what's going on this video	Haha is this like a virtual hackathon Or career fair
ya or virtual conference haha	Oh that's so cool
so what do you see like what's going on in this video	You're like walking up to a company booth And then away from. It
ok good, what else basically just describe what you see	"OK so a small figure approaches a company table from the left. When it gets near it receives a prompt ""press x to interact"". The figure moves back left again and the prompt disappears"
great ok that's super helpful let's say that you wanted to talk to this company's recruiters	Haha yayy
how do you think you would do so	Press the x key on my keyboard probbaly
i see and how did you know that?	The prompt that appeared on the screen said press x So I infer that it's the x key on my keyboard
ok perfect and when you came to that conclusion how did you decide that the x to interact was referring to that booth vs something else on the screen	The prompt only appeared as I neared the booth So it must have been related to that particular element 9n the screne
ok excellent thankssss i have failed my task unfortunately but this was extremely helpful lol	Oh nooooo What were u looking for lol Tbh I'm looking at this from my phone so it's very liekley I missed something on the screen since. I couldn't zoom in from here
oooooh ok that's reasonable im not going to spoil it yet, lmk if you have a chance to take a peek on the laptop but the feedback was suuuper valuable regardless	Oh okay haha I'm glad I'll take a look at in on my laptop later loll
yayy what have you been up to lately	I've been cramming 036 But it's the night before and I'm still kinda failing the content lol So I just stopped for tonight I took a look at some 9.00 stuff this morning cuz I have that tmrw too
good luckkk you're gonna do great <3	haha thanks alex <3
you got this!	Hi do u know if we can assume that sequence AVLs keep track of index for us
hihi Ummmm Hm yeah i think you can blackbox sequence AVL operations but if you augment with anything else u have to tell us how	OK sureer Rip quiz 1 material I couldnt do any of those questions on the prac final
hahaha yeah that's lowkey how i feel quiz 1 was hard	I'm still shocked how I did progressively worse when clearly I understood quiz 1 the least lmao Anyways we about to go over this answer key rip hi do u have any guidance on this justification i don't really get how it could be more than k edges?
oh this is old BF like before this sem	9h huh Like Could it still be more than k edges tho Like in the graph dup I remember can it still be more
ya it can	:o wait does relaxation double the number potential edges each time I feel like I remember that from 009
ummm gimme a moment in the middle of something but want to answer your question right haha	Oh yah no worries don't feel obligated I can always ask around
So old Bellman Ford Just relaxes all the edges V times If you got lucky with relaxation order You could relax all the edges on the first round But don’t worry about it we didn’t really emphasize it this semester Not quite sure what you mean by relaxation doubles the number of edges The edges in the graph stay constant unless you’re adding stuff to the graph as you go	Oh no I meant like the number of edges on a shortest path doubles But It's ok
Hm, I don’t think that’s true for our definition of relaxation right Like you can relax an edge I’m not sure why the SP would double?	Uh yeah I'm not really sure either I just thought it was like When u traverse a bfs tree Idk maybe it was Dijkstra's we did in 009 So one relaxation could get u something that's more than k edges?
On bellman ford? Ummm What’s k here? Sorry I’m confused :o	Oh k was the number of edges in the problem statement Like if u relax k times You could potentially get a path between two vertices larger than k
Relax k iterations	Yeah
Which means relax kV times Actually This is old bellman ford we didn’t really teach it	OK I just Will forget about it then lol
haha okay i think you only have to worry about the one we presented in this iteration	Ah whew okie
:D	How have u been
ive been sooo busy	Nooooo why
lots of work also i realized i forgot to register for the degree list big oof	O rip Ok Good luck You're in the endgame now aren't u
lol true i've started my next venture though!	Yayyy what is it also if u have any time i have a question about one of the q's on quiz 2 my explanation wasn't really clear and it didn't follow the staff solutions but i think it works lol? I never really got around to looking at it during the regrade period but i just want to make sure that i'm understanding everything correctly
ya sure send it ill take a look when i have a chunk of time i ended up cofounding a startup with a few friends so that's been soaking all my time	tanks sir
which problem is this	oh what that's so cool oh rip mb it's quiz 2 count cycles i can send the q too what's it about
uhhhh hmmm i think that works? not the standard solution	yeah i was looking at the answer key and like the approach is basically that if a vertex v has a negative path to it it's like reachable from a neg cycle so instead of separating into components i just traced back for every vertex keeping track of which nodes i'd seen which was like kind of how they separated into connected components so i figured it might have some correctness to it
yeah i think it works oh wait ummm oh you hash each individual vertex right ohhh wait each vertex is only touched by one neg cycle mmm yeah i think it's mostly fine there are some nuanaces e.g. ABC hashes differently than CBA	ah i see yeh ok thanks alexxxx  alex if u have time u should compare music taste w me
ok!! happy end of sem :) damn dat 47% basically quiz 1 average	happy end of sem to u too !! Ahahah rip
is that bad idek	That hit home
i feel like 47% similarity is like pretty good	Ig between us two it is
LOL ok zoomer	I got 77 with a friend who doesn't even listen to any similar music as me OK old man
algorithm is broken confirmed i see u with that BTS	Eek it really weights all the listening history the same It should weight recent listening heavier We need weighted nodes Bts is never leaving my Spotify history
dijkstra	It's like dark history that u can't escape
ok im going to stop 006 is now my past i am no longer a 006 TA	:')
time to spread my wings and evolve into my new identity	It was fun while it lasted
true	Ahahaha yes
will miss mit	Oh so the grading is done mit misses u already
lol we're almost done we got a lot of blanks like on questions so	"Ahahah yeah the 006 gc after was like ""i just submitted my blank final"" ""I submitted a story for mine"" ""I couldn't even get a 0% by not answering the questions"""
lmao yeah there were some very good memes grading was fun	Haha I'm glad I wasn't funny in mine unfortunately I should have been lol
hah, tbh i was surprised that there were not more just blanks	Everyone has that little ambition haha
true im impressed	Mmmmm were good kids haha Who make more work for the TAs haha
can't believe we're done feels so weird no more school for me :o	haha does it feel good?
hahaha yeah a little bit are you excited for summer	ahaha a little bit i have this urop that might be time intensive but i'm gonna work on some personal projects/startup ideas this summer and do some personal developmenty things
That’s awesome what kind of ideas :o	haha one of thtem is like a social spotify/music sharing platform the other is a student pubbing platform for opportunities like research, programs, events
Would this be on web?	yeah i think both of them would be we haven't even begun working on them yet they're just ideas floating rn
Who would you work on it with	One of them is a team for hacklodge which got cancelled then converted to sandbox The other is just a friend ik and somebody else she's friends with
omg you `were going to do hacklodge?	yeahhh i was originally not gonna bc i didn't have ideas but someone asked me to join their team and then we brainstormed and came up w something
i did hack lodge!!! i was one of the early hack lodge ppl	oh no way
yeah im pretty close with brian who started hack lodge he's asked me to come back and mentor a few times but i've always been too busy it's great that you're doing it honestly though a lot of the fun was actually being in the house gosh that was so good like idk i just really enjoyed hack lodge	wowowowo hahah that's great it's not really happening this year tho T.T
Yeah sad what’s this sandbox thing	It's like mit startup funding and mentorship
ooooh interesting :o should be fun	We have not secured the bank yet tho

Npnp	What's your phone # I'll call u when I get out Im almost done
9784932253 I’m downstairs lol in the Microsoft office On the river side	Do u want to do fencing w me next wuarter Tue Thur 1pm
Hmmm Is 6.004 lecture nec? Is there something that fits with your sched too?	Lmao my Mondays and Wednesdays are full tho
When is pe Regis? Tomorrow right? Send schedule! Lol only one that looks like it fits for me so far is tennis on Tuesday Wait looking at wrong schedule	yes lol ok wait i'll send
How can you find schedule for next term?	i'm firehosing it but studentschedule.mit.edu not official since most of the times u can switch plus we haven't registered officially for classes yet
I mean Pe schedule	oh uhhh 
Lol Rip	lol
It’s the first thing in the site	u suck lol
I actually do XD	no can do :pp
Don’t you have something At 2 TH TR	Yes It's only an hour class tho
Wait But it says 2-3:30	What fencing? No I mean fencing TR 1pm Only goes to 2
oh wait I was looking at fencing at 3:00 lol	Lol whatttt
nvmnvm MW fencing at 1-2	NO TR
Oh rip	Ugh fine At least we'll be able to talk about it
Wait hmm I’m shifting things around still lol	Make sure u take archery next quarter too then! Haha have u taken a PE yet
are you gonna be a pirate?	Jopefully
bruh I took 2	I haven't passed my boat test yet bur We'll get theee Oh which ones
haha yeah squash and ice hockey	I've only taken one since pistol got canceled For one quarter U take such exotic sports
then you got guaranteed next quarter at least	That's so interestinf Yeah I did So that was nice
uhhh pistol is probs more exotic lmao	Eh I guess
1-2 on TR is taken by 6.004 lecture:( and that's not movable:( hmm I might actually try to go for pistol at 2PM MW and if it doesn't work out I'll go for fencing	It'll be super fun
Quick question! How much more taking is there in 6.004 Compared to like 6.042	What does this mean
Like do you think How many pages of paper do you need Per lecture	Oh note taking Uh none in 6.004 there's lecture slide handouts How many pages of notes do I need for 036 And 006
Very little for both I used like 50 mini (9 by 6) pages for each Both sides	aight awesome what's your kerb and student id
awang23 921518052 What’s this for?	Guest list
Yeeet Lol me making fun of Claire	lmao Beautiful  what's the difference between a classifier and a hyperplane
Hyper plane is the actual mathematical thing A classifier uses a hyper plane to divide the space	how to tell if two vectors on same hyperplane
If you have the equation for the plane Like theta dot x plus theta0 = 0 The vectors lie on it if they satisfy the equation If you’re stuck in a problem send me a photo!	okiee i think this sort of makes sense hard to explain over text tho also idk linear so this makes things harder
Sometimes you use a hyper plane as an intermediary step And the actual classifier is like a twisted hyper plane or something	sad
Classifier are also more general sometimes there are more than 2 categories Hyper plane linear classifier is a specific type of classifier that uses a hyper plane to split points in space	ah yes i feel like i understand that p well
Lmk if there are lin alg confusions!	will do
I think you have def good ideas about how things should be done And know what you’re doing In hack You have fin experience from startlabs and you can learn a lot I think the biggest thing you should think about is how much time you’re gonna commit even after you delegate	Yeah I know Feel like this is still the main issue im thinking about
On top of that Are you going to stay in dev?	yeah most likely jack said even as director his primary focus is still dev
Hmm I think co is prob a good decision then Bp you might not have a co but that’s more chill	yeah i guess so i'm still thinking would u become my supporter
Yah duh Lol I highly support this	LOL thanks allen
Yoo do you know if you are allowed to give a checkoff off duty? I waited in csail for 2 hr today lol and the guy said he had to help everyone on help q first and then now he’s like go home come back another day Or las in general? Nvm I signed up for tomorrow lol	Oh nice Yeah u technically can but you're supposed to sign up for a scheduled checkoff
halp! what's going on	Lmfao Hi
hi so confused lol	I am in class rm But can explain sometime tonight
yay !	i have lab until 10pm tn most likely will get back around 930pm if i'm fast
Ty	 ^tmux guide also do u still need 004 help
I went to rec and it makes more sense now ty!	:DD allen are you on your way
Yes:p Best of luck today! I’m sick so I’m staying at home today	Aw hope u feel better Thanks lmao
A vote for fu is indeed a vote for _you_ This is true	lmaooo thanks allen appreciate the support did u let jack know you were missing
chilllll I'm not gonna forget to vote lmao	Wait no it's not about that I'm worried because of your attendance record
my attendance is good I think	Damn u really did that to me OK fair
Those rhetoric skills pulled thru haha	Omfg You weren't supposed to text me this soon But thank u
I know what they intend to do: have the word X be at location 400 What’s the point of the dots	just to tell u start address like where that line is in memory
wait so . = 0x0 what does that mean? it means that line is at line 0?	yeah like the first execution instruction is at 0x0 because your code has to be stored somewhere in memory too right
oh and . = 0x400 means at location 400 we have word 0xc0c0a0a0 ok cool ty	yes
Quick question: why is the middle on A+B Oh wait it’s a mux nvm	Haha that worked well
Ahhh sorry another quick question Is demystification This stuff?	Possibly? Did u guys do pull ups and pull down yet
Yup The stuff on P=IV And P= CV^2f not on quiz right?	Uh yeah there's no physics
hack hed! we're reading apps!	allen how do you calculate the partial derivs for the weights on a neural network
Ok I’m here remember you square things for loss L = (1 + 5x_1 + 5x_2 - y)^2 or actually, it's better to write L = (w_0 + w_1x_1  + w_2x^2 - y)^2 in this case so for example, derivative of L with respect to w_1 would be 2*(w_0 + w_1x_1  + w_2x^2 - y)*x_1 where I used the chain rule in the sense that: dL/dw_1 = dL/(d(the expression that is squared)) * d(the expression that is squared)/d_x_1 dL/(d(the expression that is squared)) is just 2* (w_0 + w_1x_1  + w_2x^2 - y) while d(the expression that is squared)/dw_1 = is just w_1's coefficient, which is x_1 I meant /d(w_1) in the very last expression also I'm getting super hosed tomorrow:(( idk what I'm gonna do:((	ohhhhh that makes a lot of sense oh no what do u have going on wait allen i am trying 2 * 1 (error) * -1 (which is x_1) which is -2 right but this is not working
I’m here again I have a massive pset due Tuesday	haha if you're busy you don't need to help me
Rip Nope it’s fine	thanks allen i appreciate you what class
I also have a midterm on Tuesday but I’m gonna go in raw :p	niceee good luck allen you got this
Ok let me check the answers to see if this is right so far	lmao nice thanks allen
I might need to dip dev meeting tomorrow rip But I will come to all team	damn ok all team is gonna be really fun tmrw
Mainly because jiahai who I’m gonna beg for help sleeps earliy	jiahai aye what class is this again
6.437	bro are you a god or smth
What number question is this? It’s not in screenshot	2c
Oh wait exercises	yeah haha i finished the homework
Yeah -2 is right for w1 Derivative What did you get for the other ones?	so like [1, -2, 2] is what i got
Check the first one	0
W0	is it 0 i tried 0 too
Nope	oh is it 2 wait i'm dumb thank you allen
Think about if the same way as the others	i can update the weights using the normal step func methods right
I’ll be up for a while so lmk if you need halp on the others	just like w - loss*step okay haha thank you allen are you going to be free
I think so?	this weekend we should hang out because i never see u anymore
This weekend? Yea sure lol	because you decided to kill yourself this semester
The problem is	put it in your calendar!
I’m kinda sick still	it's ok
So we’ll see	the guys across the hall are also sick so oh u mean you're not feeling well i thought u meant corona
I just have a dry cough	ok yeah take care of yourself first

But I’ll be online so ya It’s a bio lab	oh what interesting why choose bio
My high school English teacher texted me That he husband needed a uroper So I agreed lolw	ayeee that's so fun
So I’m just staring at brain data rn and trying to learn neuroscience	and so cool ahaha i love course 9 tho
I wanna take 9.00 9.01 at some point	i'm in 9.00 rn waste of time if you're trying to learn but interesting and fun
Oh! How is it? Oh hmm Sounds like a chill class	gabrieli just shows us optical illusions and psych experiments super chill but there are 3 exams that he doesn't really teach us the content for so i have to do some serious reading this weekend it's all good tho
yeah haha	9.01 would be more technial for sure tho
do you still work in music lib?	not so much anymore it's usually too warm that i want to fall asleep i still really like it there but i'm also looking for anotehr really nice place to work

They ok	if it's not i'll stick with medium for now
Ayyy	lol i can't focus tho my whole body is just like recovering from the stress of the last week it's physically and mentally drained although i'm still bored
What was the stress from specifically?	mostly packing trying to see everybody earlier in the week it was because i thought 006 was still a thing
Oh :((well it’s moved now yay! I’m catching up on schoolwork—almost there lmao And then... not sure, maybe app stuff, oh wait! I was gonna grind for usaco lmao Worst thing is I have a curfew at home so bye!	bro i haven't even started catching up wait what what are u doing usaco for wait what you have curfew? like when u need tos leep by?
For fun! (As a spectator you still can move up the divisions) Have to shower by 1 but sleep whenever lol	wait what really? oh i see strict curfew but makes sense
Yes Lol Up so late lmao So many of my frands are so bored lol	is this considered late
Someone stated player poptropica Wait this is pretty late R ur parents waking u up in morning?	wtf lmfao what would they wake me up for
Wait it’s first day for you	i have nothing to wake up for
To be productive lol	this is standard
Did u sleep this late in hs?	it is break yeah around 1 or 2am
Bruh	i didn't have a first hour senior spring tho so i only needed to get to school by like 8 i sleep more in college than i did in hs for sure tho maybe less on weekends in college but on average a little more
Wait I’ve always had my breaks productive lmao	omg no stop this allen
Feb break was always math grind XD	you're making me feel bad for being a bum all day i've LITERALLY been a bum all day oh jesus you're too motivated stop this rigth now
In hs! Not rn tho Wait but I’ve been so unproductive recently I watched like 10 videos straight on people analyzing coronavirus today	bieing unproductive is A oK
Yes maam	take some time to just relax and chill yanno i'm watching a tv show called the good place rn u should catch up

Wait why? Oh :((	just don't wanna give anything i might have to my parents
So you never see parents? Ok yup makes sense It is more difficult to do social stuff... I’m not allowed to leave house for 1.5 weeks either... Maybe it’s time to start reading for fun again hmm Aight too late for me—bye	i call them on the phone lmao good nightt allen what was your gf's name agai
Grace Yah I think she sent u frand req lmao	oh wait she friend requested me i'm pretty sure
Ayyy nice blog post!	thanks allen aha i was trying to make sure i kept a memento of some things i did also i want to make my own website and write too idk i got kind of ambitious so hopefully i'll learn react and actually make a website at some point
Ayy that’s good	lol i don't think i'll follow up
I should prob mentally blog to see what I remember	you should actually just blog
Haha I used to but discontinued after September	oh what where's your blog
It’s a collection of random bits from high school Some of it is overly nerdy and cringe to be read Some other bits are more meaningful 	wowowowo u were on aops as your blog? oh it's like a microblogging platform like tumblr but better ALLEN YOU GOT INTO HARVARD TOO???? wow
I customized it w css I stole from somewhere lmao	you're actually a fucking g it's nice honestly i like reading it are u going back there like ever
I think I may get back into aops bloggin lol It’s a good place to hide out Blogging privately is nice because it gives you an abyss to yell into Wait matcha latte????	can i read your abyss blogs yeah boi
Wait Was this before strang meeting? Then why didn’t u get a matcha latte like both Sarah and I lmao	i like chai lattes more bro didn't i get a chai latte
I think so	i keep trying to get chai for teh stata forbes cafe
Hmmm interesting	and they're always out chai is #1 matcha #2
I might try chai latte someday then	i like matcha but it's basic and i have it too much in everything asian
Ah this reminds me of something I’ve thought deeply about Like when u go to restaurant	what is it
Do you have a set order And if so how did you converge upon a specific order? Like I always get taro milk tea But that’s becuz the first time I had boba a friend recommended and I haven’t really tried other flavors	ooh yes i do have a specific set boba order
Why do I always go to same order if I’m not certain it’s optimal?	but i try to get new things when i can wait depends on what restaurant tho
What’s the correct ratio of exploration ca exploitation of the current optimal solution	if i've been before i generally know what's good
Like chipotle	oh huh
Or McDonald’s	i feel like it doesn't take that long to find the optimal order at chipotle though oh facts i have thought about this too the answer is kind of just whenever u want
Nahhh The answer is reinforcement learning :p Just kidding lol But i had an epiphany in 6.036 when I thought I could apply machine learning to my orders lol	omg
Existential crisis rip:(	u rn?
Nope just reading ur blog FROCT sounds like a lit group	yeah existential crisis was real atm froct was p lit i didn't realize how much they meant to me until like every other bullet point included them
Well u do basically everything w one of em	eek yeah
Meanwhile we can also look at how important your clubs are in order	i should try to expand my circles a little more
Of how often they are mentioned	oh that's facts i never mention wbl club tennis is actually really fun but i didn't mention it bc prac is just prac
Hmm I had prob a super spread out friend group	in hs i actually never really had a set friend group either i was a jumper lol welll no that's not true i sort of did but i never got to see them bc
Oh haha I’m jumper here	we all did different stuff i like being a jumper but sometimes it gets lonely i mean froct is just like a living space too so in some ways i still feel like one becuase i have like david and saaketh who hang out with some other friends i'm close to but don't hang out w all the time
Yeah I’m a jumper in college U prob can tell based on how rarely u see me lol	i think that's just cuz you're overcommitted but ok
And I hope to be less overcommitted next year!!!	:DD YES
Wait r u doing counterpoint? And harmony Nvm too early to think about this lol Also	possibly
Do u realize	i'm not sure if i'm that into music yet
We’re gonna be sophomores without gpa Cuz we’re on forced pnr	yep i do we can calculate our own internal GPAs right
It just hit me lol Yeah	that's what i'll be listing anyways
But strang hit me up with the b+ So I’ll leave gpa blank haha Alright too late ttyl	damn he really did u dirty good nightt what's unravel?
Anime song ppl in my wing listened to	oh interesting what instrument r u trying to learn it on?
Piano!	oh did u play like intesively in hs
Not really Just for fun largely	hey that's cool tho i wish i still played honestly
Never too late to start again Practice outside of 26-100 lol	Ahah that piano is kind of gross ngl
Mmm that’s kinda true Next house has a piano:p If you take harmony and counterpoint u get access to the practice rooms in building 4	Oh shittt Thats so cool did you change your blog url
Nop still same link	oh what it wasn't working yesterday
hmm interesting u can always google verticy and vertexapodes	what was the inspiration for that name bw also i can't believe i just read a math proof on your latest post
"in any geometry class no matter how hard people try someone eventually screws up and says verticy and vertexes this greatly irked MathILy's program director who then put a clause into a form that we will pronounce ""Euler"" correct and use the correct plural form of matrix and vertex but anyways people still messed up and then we just gave up and used verticy and vertexapodes as the singular and plural vertexapodes is based off the plural for octopus: octopodes"	i have just glimpsed into the world of math humor
lmao u r a nerd also	i am also nerd but perhaps not that nerd
lol I am many diff nerds	Agree milo uses dvorak keyboard
milo? also random thing I remembered: remember we signed up to write blog posts about hack? it was like during the meeting after hackmit	LOL yeah i never did anything milo cress
i didn't either lol	idk if u met him but he lives across the hall or lived* across the hall from me
oh hmm nope haven't met him i gtg in middle of poker meeting lol elections*	oh what lmao
spicy	eek
zoom	spicy indeed
Wait on hack U can technically see our recruitment cycles notes right? That’s scary :O	Uhhh I can't see ours no
hellohello! you knew I was gonna be back with 6.004 qs lol I'm trying to do 1.4 on Lab 5 which is building a faster sequential Multiplier by using the faster adder from lab 4 Fastadder in lab 4 passed the fastest test but I'm wondering if you can hint me as to where I can continue to speed up the code? (Before I used fast adder it was 390 ps, now its 370ps which is confusing because I thought it would reduce the time significantly... the goal in the lab is 280ps) Just kidding—I figured it out!	Oh wowowo On great haha lmao when did wendy think this
I think she really liked the class Although she didn’t really pay attention haha Also do you have thoughts yet about a fall ci-h?	maybe intro to world music i'm not sure yet Wbu
Lol for hasses for the most part I don’t have a strong preference so I think I’m just gonna take classes that have more frands in them Just sent off the email about the uplifting note Hopefully I followed the directions I’m kinda dead at 3 am	Aww yayy OK so I'll let u know what cih I end up choosing then Yeah go to sleep
I’m also thinking about philosophy But I think I would probably enjoy a philosophy course that is less writing intensive though and not as difficult as the cih courses so I’m not sure Oh well gn	I heard the philosophy ci-hs are really hard Gnnnn
Wait are we 8pm est Monday from here on out regularly?	yes always
Rip me	are u not able to make this tim ever
I’m eating dinner rn	oh well you are the only
I thought it was nine oops	unexcused today lmao
Oh well added it to calendar now	it's always on the hack calendar fyi just copy it ovre or show calendar
It has all the bdays and a lot of others clutter that make me seem busier than I actually am lol Ok I enabled it on my phone I’m gonna hop on go nm to catch up after eating	lol good idea
Quick question: What does skillsheet viewer —> linkedin mean?	Facilitate sending emails Between sponsors and hackers
Rip I prob can’t go retreat:( Oh well I’ll catch everyone some other time	Boooo
Halp! 004 killing me lol	Wow I feel the same way about 036 What can I help u with
I spent 3 hr debugging this case block And the thing was like “cannot parse” and wasn’t giving any clear indication of what the bug was Turns out I misspelled brFunc the whole time	sir lmao what was the error message
Lol that was the error and I kept thinking i was doing something wrong w case turns out I’m bad at capitalization of letters and missspelled	oh rip
You’re in my fb ads	Wait I haven't even seen that before That's so cool tho sqlalchemy.exc.OperationalError: (psycopg2.OperationalError) could not connect to server: Connection refused have u ever experienced this error w gavel also do u know if export to csv prompts a download
This I’m not sure Check requirements.txt I recently updated it, so maybe psycopg is outdated Also which database are you connected to?	should i update psycopg2 uhm unclear db_uri: postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost/gavel how do i start up postgres on my machine again
Oh lemme send you the link replace db_uri with this:  it will show you a link that justin said to keep secret lol	ah thanks allen is there a specific broker uri i need to too
Broker uri? I’m not sure... if u have issues send me screenshots	ok i wanted to test it earlier today bc jianna wants to figure out how to do an exportcsv which i know existed on gavel at some point but i'm too lazy rn so maybe i'll give this a shot later
Wait Gavel has an upload csv And a download csv Just clarifying also I think I accidentally deployed it on heroku oops so if you need a quick thing like a test you can try this link:  admin pass is admin	what steh username
admin	i just tried that no work
admin and admin?	yeah
wait I may have forgot pass lemme reset admin pass might be	just keeps asking me to sign in lol
change-this-before-deploying	lol that worked
lmao ok feel free to do anythign with the deloyed version I'm just playing around with stuff	thank you :DD hey do u know where the code is for the download csv link i can't find it in the develop brnach
Like the code for the download csv button?	oh did u just send me the csv files yeah i meant the csv code frontend
Okee gimme one sec	haha tytyt
It’s not in develop It’s in master On line 142 of admin.html	are we looking at the same thing
Yeah it should be right above that Oh hmm Now I’m confused what version of gavel I’m on lol While I check I’ll send you this:	sorry i thought i sent u line numbers yeah i'm confused where r u
Right above add project there’s a download csv which gives api call The api call looks like this in flask	oh hmm yeah your version def looks different from mie that's fine tho there's no get or post specified tho how does that work
Ok I think something bad happened rip The version were on (old version) has no csv stuff added The heroku version I deployed is anish version I’m gonna figure this out l8r but mom wants Mother’s Day attention so I gtg rn lol	yeah haha gogo
yeah so basically the deployed version is anish's version which is ahead of techX's version  ^ that shows the details behind anish's commit our version, shown below, doesn't have download csv capabilities yet in fact	Yeah rip lol
Question of curiosity: how’s LAing for 004? How much work is it and how much work is required, and are you planning to do it again?	it's not bad at all i'm not sure if i'm going to do it again it's by far one of the easier LA positions it seems like but you just have to do the labs every week but this semester they were almost a copy of last semester's with some small changes how's 036 LAing i might want to give that a shot if I do decently this semester we'll see the final is yet to come
LAing in 036 is like super super chill Lol even during OH and lab It’s also quite good revie Review But yeah I’m still thinking about which to LA for	Oh u wanna try 004? Is there any work u have to do ahead of time for it
Nope There’s a three hour lab meeting with dinner provided *la meeting The whole group goes over the lab and hw but most of the time I pset and glance over the material when ppl are doing the nano quiz	Oh lit that's nice lol Wait is it LAs that staff lab hours Or just TAs Three hours is a longer time than I was expecting But dinner is nice But also idk are the instructors good for this class because I feel like they're been kind of AWOL and not providing any support or material
LAs staff lab hours and office hours This is questionable tbh... I get that last semester was better	Got it Like it's questionable that they're not good or they are
If they are good Last semester was Leslie kaebling who was good	Oh right She is good do u know if last year's final was cumulative
Nope Actually, I’m not sure but I remember there was perceptron on the midterm and not the final	Oh fuck lol I just started taking practice exams but they're so fucking long and hard I'm only on like 7/40 on the first one and I've been like Blindly guessing what to do lol
for some of the qs it really feels that way:( first practice exam was rough for me haha but you'll adapt	T.T No time to adapt lol
you have a week still right?	It's this Friday lol allen what do double brackets mean like specifically in this question
Ahhhh sorry sorry I think it means the matrix where the entry is 1 if f was > 0 Other wise the entry is 0 It’s kinda like an “indicator matrix” And it appears basically when there’s a derivative and a relu involved Since the relu’s derivative is 1 if x> 0 and it is 0 otherwise In fact drelu(x)/dx can probably be written as [[x>0]] Sorry for late reply! You probs already figured it out lol	Ah I see Yeah no problem you're probably really busy Thanks this test is slow going but I'm just about halfway through lol
No worries send me any confusions Not busy lol life is chill at the moment	:oo Ok Will do :D ok i have another question lol so part j gives this 10x10 input image and u apply the filter as described what exactly is l asking for because i thought it's just asking about the filter dimensions
Lolol looks like the question is missing a word	dude idk i haven't been understanding the questions
It’s asking for dimensions of filter volume This wasn’t explained in class either But was really subtle from a diagram Do you get the part where the output is 5x5? Since filter size is 2, you move by 2 and padding is 0	i didn't draw it out or anything but it seems legit and there's like the formula calculation so
So applying that filter gives soemthing that is 5x5	yeah
But in cnn Each layer has not just one filter But many filters Each of these filters will produce a 5x5 thing Which is why they are talking about output “volume” since they are implying there are three dimensions And in the last sentence they say there are two filters	yeah i get that it'd make a 5x5x2 output
So the result is 5x5x2	right what is this parameter sharing thing tho
This is actually so hard to understand Give me a few min	lol no worries i can ask on piazza this question doesn't really make sense to me because if the filter is 2x2 then shouldn't u only need like 4 weights
Yeah that’s what I thought But then again what do they mean by convolutional layer? I think convolutional layer is the result after applying the filter	i don't understand the result of the calculation 5x5x2x5 like where is the extra 5 at the end coming from and is it just asking how many activation values are there after an application of this filter? meh i'll ask on piazza
Yeah ask this one on piazza—lol I’m a to ok reading it and am completely lost You prob shouldn’t dwell too long on badly worded questions and try to cover content:)	lol ok thanks allen:) honestly the cnn section is like the easiest for me to grasp just cuz i do some computer vision stuff so this question made me question everythign
Still send me questions lol I will try to halp	okieee
Imma go review now actually lmao	do u not have a lot of finals lol why are u studying 036 lol
I have 2 Next week	oh which ones oh that's nice
Just to soldify 6046 6437	oh shit how has 046 been
It’s been fine It’s more of a math class for sure	also r u tight with the other 036 LAs
I did like 006 more	just curious
Some of em	ripppp
I met jett	i'm so awful at math
Who I’m quite close with Wait oh shoot I have a meeting at 5 lmao Shots hit shit	ok gogo
Lol be back in a bit Take 046 at some point next year!	lol will do will do i have to do get my degree anywyas
046>045 Quick comment on 046: it’s prob the hardest class to teach since the range of experiences across the course 6 and 18 students is almost impossible to work with	how was your meeting
The problem set takes from 4-10 hr depending on many things	i guess so but it's hard either way
Like I feel that 006 is nicer Since the concepts are fundamental enough so that ppl can grasp it	ugh i've been doing worse and worse in 006 i failed the last two quizzes p badly
Wait don’t worry General trend was that Cuz it builds and gets harder	i literally just keep doing worse tho lol like i felt that i enjoyed the material from quiz 2 and 3 better than 1 but i did way worse successively
Hmmm... is it like silly mistakes in your write up or blanking on problems? Cuz I often felt like in 006 I either got the problem or like got a 0 of the problem Also has Alex Chen shared with y’all his folder of past exams? I’ve heard those are quite helpful—and practice is good	Yeah he has It's like panicking mistakes Where I just like forget what to do And I always get docked for small errors because I rush I never work fast enough
Keep practicing! The problem format and styles repeat in subtle ways. Ik you’re shooting to do well even on pnr, but for these things practice and experience and some creativity is what it breaks down to	"Rip ok Thanks allen to clarify the offset parameter is the like ""y-intercept"" right i don't really understand the answer for 1.1"
Offset is kinda like y intercept But not exactly	so like the answer key says the answer is -7 but i don't understand that at all they like sum the number of erros * correct label for every data point
Yes exactly Recall that perceptron adds the label of the point each time it makes a mistake On line 7 of the photo above Line 5 is saying “if we make a mistake” then do lines 6 and 7 which update our weights	oh so does it check all the data points when it does the iteration
Theta_0 is updated by adding the label which is 1 or -1	yeah ok that makes sense sort of if u look at the graph tho how could -7 ever be the right offset tho oh
Ah ok yeah so the offset is hard to interpret geometrically	i guess there's two x's yeah wait just to clarify the t is like the length of the number of data points we have because we iterate through each one once right and then for every time we iterate we update our theta based on the number of mistakes so like the actual fact that we're iterating through a certain point is like doesn't matter right
In the photo I sent t is the number of iterations we do over the n points T is the dimension we’re in So perceptron is: do t loops over all n points each time updating Thera when we make a mistake on a particular point Yeah so to update theta_0 it doesn’t matter when we made mistakes, since each iteration we updated by adding label if we make a mistake, to find the final theta_0 we only need to know the labels and the number of mistakes corresponding to each point Does that all make sense?	"so if we're iterating through n points over and over until we reach convergence how can there be some number of ""perceptron mistakes"" at a certain point like associated with a certain point bbecause i'm thinking like the number of mistakes for all points should be associated with the iteration we're currently on oh you're saying in total i see ok yeah that makes sense haha ok thanks allen whew"
Also to clarify In perceptron there’s theta and theta_0 The equation of our line (or hyper plane) is theta*x + theta_0 = 0 So our y intercept is -theta_0/theta Or I mean -theta_0 divides by the second coordinate of theta	hmm ok seems complicated cuz it's actualy like theta1*x1 + theta2*x2 + theta0 right = 0
Yeah yeah	so u just need to convert it to some x2 = slope*x + y-int x1* yeah ok yeah i misinterpreted
It trips people up sometime since other sources put theta_0 on the other side	oh hmm ;pp i don't remember using the alpha learning rate before with q learning how does that work i only recall the second part of this term in the solution oh jk we're good i found it
Yeep	the actual final was a lot shorter than the final review whew i thought it was gonna be teh same length lol for this question what does rank mean also i am confused by this notion of average activation and how you'd select the activation for it
Yo I’m so stupid I just rm -rf the folder with all my java files on accident lmao	oh shit loll why how could u do that on accident
I wanted to try running java on terminal So I made a test folder And then when I went to delete the test folder I deleted my java workspace rip	omg lol i can't even begin to understand this lol howwwww
I was doing things in Test and then I deleted my java workspace instead of Test folder I’m so dumb Okay wait lemme check this 036 q	lol holy
Rank is a linear algebra term which tells us how many rows are linearly independent Rows of a matrix are linearly independent if you can form one of the rows using multiples of the other ones for example [1 0 0] and [0 1 0] are linearly independent similarly, [1 0 0] [0 1 0] and [1 1 1] are linearly independent	so if it's 1
however stuff like [1 0 0 ] [0 1 0] and [1 1 0] is not	that means all the rows are multiples of one of them
yeup or all the columns are multiples of one of them :P	ohh hmm i see
if its rank two, it means you can pick out two rows and the rest are cominations of them a fact they expect you to know about rank is that	so that means u can def find a U and V that fit perfectly if it's rank 1
"well not quite it depends on u and v's dimensions if u and v are vectors I agree it's rank 1 like if M = UV* (I'm using * for transpose) and U is n x 1 and V is 1 x n then then M is rank one in general rank tells us ""how independent"" the rows are (kinda like how muhc degree of freedom there is) and so when we decompose M into UV, if M has rank r, then the decomposition can only be exactly true if both U and V have rank at least r"	:ooo i see
so if M (m x n matrix) has rank r, and we have M = UV exactly then U might be a m x r matrix while V is a r x n matrix	wait why is that x r necessary to have M's rank be true oh is this like a combinations thing
yup	ok i think i see i don't need to know this too deeply right
the weird thing is I think before last year they had 18.06 as a prereq which would be helpful in this unit	oh lol i see yeah going in all the instructors acted like we knew linalg which was weird i thought and they just like expected us to know it and i was like huh but it would make sense that lin alg is useful math is just useful in general lol i should have tried to have more of an interest in it during hs but all the kiddos at school were doing math so i was like nahh
haha the community really shapes it... and math kids are sometimes a little weird to say the least or hypercompetitive	LOL there's just
and often they have like their own lingo	so many math kids
at mit? novi? or in the world?	the confession on mit confessions was great tho in the world and mit at novi it was mostly a select few indian kids in middle school
gender of kids?	all the kids went to this center called icae for math and i quit in like early middle school cuz they didn't really teach well it was just indian kids flexing and i didn't learn from it and didn't have enough motivation to learn it myself lol but yeah anyways from then on competition math was just like out of the picture for me mostly boys ofc
yo indian kids who flex trigger me lmao *bois	i mean the it was indus center for academic excellence (ICAE) so it was bound to be
ohhh the gender thing is a problem	all the teachers were old indian men with heavy accents who never explained the problem just asked if we knew how to do it and made some kid who could solve it explain it in like 2 sec
my sister has trouble finding ppl to work with and stuff	oh rip :(( yeah that's true
I had a chill group of friends who I hung out with a lot and did math with	i mean
we were the ones who flew paper airplanes at hmmt proctors lol like very chill dudes	"ok wait also to clarify icae was mostly indian AND chinese kids like a good portion of chinese dudes LOL nice ""chill dude"""
nOoOOooo lol theta xi's 2023 are like math kids chill dudes	i mean does your sister have like a math friend group or all high schoolers still in their like avoid the other gender at all costs phase oh i have tea btw remind me to spill later
she had one in middle school, now the other little ones started doing other stuff so it's harder to stay motivated lol yo also update I'm course 15-3 at the moment	wait what how
XD	WHAT u declared finance
yup	bro where did this come from lol
ok wait wait wait	wdym little ones is it for the sloan goodie bag i bet it's for the sloan goodie bag
the other high school girls^	ohh
that's like 20% of it lol	does she hang out with a lot of guys bro you have to show me all the cool shit when you get it i should've done that damn
now it's a solitary sport for her :((	just went and straight declared 6-3 noooo
she does math in my room to stay comfy my siblings turned my bedroom into their office	LOL your siblings love you
when I come back my bro's books are all on my bed	my brother avoids me at all costs ah to be loved
he's younger though	aren't your siblings younger too
but like junior and freshman in high shcool	yeah my brother is in 8th grade
yours is like smol right	the difference is
oh	marginal
he'll come around dw	LOL i just act like he's small cuz he's an immature pos lol that's mean it's his birthday today i shouldn't say thta he's cute sometimes
oh damn hbd	LOL
to your bro	will tell him
anyways I declared 15-3 since I wanted goodies	haha what about the other 80%
I wanted an advisor who doesn't know what classes I'm taking so I can convince them to let me take what I want	omg lol i think course 6 advisors are super chill tho cuz they just want u to take whatever 6 class u want as long as it's 6
I think I'm gonna declare 6-3 very soon as a double and them sub out 15 later on	LOL nice
I think the course 15 community is really tight it's < 40 ppl in class of 2023 majoring	oh damn i see should i declare my 15-2 double soon then
and I think it's nice to interact with a different group of people oh and I forgot to tell you I'm actually 15-2	ok so
wait it's complicated lmao	u lied to me
it's like	u lied LIAR
no I'm 15-3 officially	what what what
but I was gonna go for 1-52 I'm shooting for 15-2 but 15-3 sounds cooler to declare first wait this sounds awful	ughhh you;re so strange allen wang
ahhh I'm diggin myself into a hole	this DOES sound awful yes
so basically at the end of the day	the hole do indeed be dug
I wanna minor in 15-2	omg twins lol i don't actually want a double in 15-2 the course requirements don't overlap at all it's painful so a minor is just like chill
yee lol but next year I might be recruiting into quant/trading so I felt that 15-2 major might not be as of a buzzword so I declared 15-3 so I'll have the sloanie benefits and meet the same community	oh you wanted finance instead haha
but I plan to stick to the sloanie club until like senior year	i thought the quant/trading companies liked math and physics better honestly
and then I'll drop 15-3 add a 15-2 minor and 18 major	holy ok this sounds like a mess you confused me
I'll prob have all req done by them so switching nbd	won't your 15-3 advisor be like what the heck
but I don't wanna change my major until later since I wanna still have a course 15 advisor, go to their events and meet sloan ppl yea	when you take all these other classes tho
yea oops but I'm taking 15.780 next sem so it's all good	if i declare a double will i get a 15 advisor too lol nicee
and a backpack	when am i allowed to declare this lol
I think sometime in fall sem, but goes into effect in spring officially? not sure regarding this	hmm alright let me think about this haha omg haha thanks for getting back to me
the average activation is used to help regularize it's not actually used later on in the neural network the activation function is chosen based on the problem's situation (I'm not sure if they ask you to choose it in this problem) but here, their just asking what would you use to keep p_hat close to p	is this almost like batchnorm
same motivation	so i should pick something ideally with p_hat - p in it
yup	hmm ok
or more precisely pick something that is minimized when p_hat equals p	haha yeah so NLL is also valid
aight you go back to study I've distracted u sufficiently lol i gtg figure out what java files were lost forever	LOL ok thanks allen let me know how the 15 adventures go oof i should take a 15 class next semester
Has! *yas! 15.780 Is one of the few that counts as an elective for the minor that happens in the fall Many of the other requirements are offered in spring	oh really? what class is that
15.780!! Or hmm I might take another 15-2 class too not sure yet	i know but like what is it about subject
15.780 is about stochastic models in business analytics	hmmmm
I just finished a deep reflection about a confessions post rip wasted like 10 minutes of my life lol you had tea to spill? :P	Wdym reflection about Oh yeah it's not good tea lol I heard Justin and his gf broke up Which is sad tea tbh
justin who? Oh wait	Bro
:(	Yu Yeah rip Claire did some stalking today so that's how she found out
sigh... that's why you don't post pics of your SO on fb and instagram lol	Lol but isn't that like Anticipation of a break up then I think it's fine to do that
yea i guess	And if it's a good break up U don't even have to delete the pics lol I have friends who just leave everything up From what I heard tho Justin's wasn't eek
:( it's hard for me to picture justin sad he's always so cheery and helpful and dedicated to us all	Yeah same :(( I know Even when he's hosed
lol he helped me debug gavel and missed his class:( anyways why was claire stalking them is the bigger question XD this indeed was sad tea:( aight imma go to sleep with sad tea	Haha I have no clue either I didn't ask her if u have time wondering why the answer is yes here
We start by initializing theta to 0 And each mistake we’re updating theta when we make a mistake by the point times the label our hyperplane tests whether theta * (x) is < or > 0 if we updated using a learning rate eta each time we're adding the point times the label times eta our theta with the learning rate is proportional to the original theta (by a factor of eta) if originally our hyperplane tests whether theta * (x) > 0 with the learning rate, we're testing whether (theta scaled by eta) * (x) > 0 which is the same thing	wait why is that the same thing cuz like wdym by scaled by eta
example: if we started with theta = [0, 0] and we misclassify [2,1] labeled as +, we would then updated theta to be [2,1] since we add the point [2,1] if we had an eta = 0.5 we would update theta by adding 0.5[2, 1] = [1, 0.5] note that after this making a mistake on this point if we have theta being [2,1] and [1,0.5] in the two situations but note that theta with the learning rate is exactly eta = 0.5 times the theta without the learning rate and the hyperplans 2x + y = 0 and 1x + 0.5y = 0 are the same hyperplanes!	ohhh ok
so the new classifiers after the updated are the same	i thought that the hyperplane might like classify a point in later iterations differently but i get it now it's like the same equation lol
yeah that's what our intuition tells us haha but in this problem, they told us there's no offset so its different if there were an offset (say the offset is 3), it would be completely different: we would have like 2x + y = 3 and 1x + 0.5y = 3 be the other equation and things would def play out differently	"hmm ok i see sorry i have one more q well i had a lot of questions about this whole set of questions but whatever anyways for this particular one why would anding like this random noise help reduce underfitting like how would it ""contain some information about them that can be exploited"""
Oops sorry just ate dinner	Haha no worries
Trying to undetand the solution at the moment—I think I got this one wrong last year oops ok imo this question is really bad lol but what they're saying is that even though the coin flips are random, with high probability they might be helpful in fitting the data during training for example lets say you had 8 data points with labels 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 and you flipped a coin 8 times and for each of the 8 times, you flipped T H T H H H H H obviously if this happened the neural network would easily realize that whenever there's a T, the label is a 0 and whenever there's an H the label is a 1	I got most of these ubderfittting questions wrong lol
lol that section I got so little credit on XD but what's more probable is that	Lol riperoni
"say you had 10 points labeled 1 and 12 points labeled 0 maybe for the 10 points labeled 1 you flipped more heads than tails and for the 12 points labeled 0 you flipped more tails than heads the intuition was that as long as you don't flip the same number of heads as tails, there's going to be some artificial sense of ""difference"" that we add"	Oh lol Ah I see Well
even though the artificial sense of difference makes no physical sense	This sucks
"their reasoning also was weird they're like... ""More
concretely, for n datapoints the probability of this happening is (
n choose n/2
2n → 0 and 0 for
n odd, this level of detail was not needed for a satisfactory answer"" what they did here was reason: if n is odd, the probability of flipping same number of heads as tails is 0, so we're guaranteed some ""difference"", if n is even the probability we flip same number of heads as tails is (n choose n/2)/2^n, which approaches 0 when n goes to infinity in either case we have like a super puny difference that will help us fit but as you prob know, this approach makes no sense---we're just using randomness to overfit to the data, we're not actually learning anything lol"	Yeah Ok
this whole question is garbage lol	Thank u for your support lol I thought so too I'm just worried that the exam will be very different from the practice cuz the final review and precious years exams have all had varying ranges of styles and questions
it's always a surprise, and often doesn't really test the core concepts unfortunately	Yeah lol f
but I'm sure everyone is the same boat... help queue lines and stuff showed that	Oh haha yeah piazza has been blown up I was gonna go through it But that's more time exhaustive than just practicing on my own
How was 036? I heard logistics were bad:(	uh i did decently on it the logistics did end up pretty bad but it just gave me more time to think they extended the deadline until 6pm but by 530 my brain was exhausted so i just stopped i think what i got is enough to get me an A
Ayyyy 006 final left? Grind doesn’t stop does it	yeah boi almost there
Done w freshman year!	Yes sir how does it feel
I feel hungry Freshman year went by way too fast Didn’t get around to doing somethings I wanted to do this semester And didn’t make progress on getting to know hack ppl better oopsies (but I can’t complain cuz I wasn’t putting much of an effort oops again)	Lol Eh I sort of feel the same way but like about people in general I didn't really have the chance tho second semester
Reflecting... I think I learned a lot?? I also concluded I will prob not get a urop for a while cuz they’ve always been the highest source of stress. Hack is second highest source of stress lol I feel like i have a better idea of what lies ahead and what I wanna do And learning Dvorak has helped me realize how bad I am at qwerty so I gave up on Dvorak and tried to improve QWERTY first	hackk has been making me stressed recently yeah yeah lowkey i would regret not getting a urop this summer but also they are indedd highest stresser LOL wdym i don't think i could ever switch to dvorak i'm too used to qwerty like some words i just type out automatically without thinking what are u diong over the summer again? remote internship ?
I feel like these are more high stress since there are ppl counting on me. In classes or other stuff if my grades take a hit, it’s just me and so it doesn’t feel as bad I was learning which fingers go on which keys and I realized I had horrible qwerty habits lol like never using pinky or thumb, hitting space bar with index finger etc I got moved remote and open source but I have a couple of side projects that prob will be main focus this summer tbh	lol i'm positive i don't use the shift key correctly like no matter what i always use the left one like when i want to capitalize A I just move everything
wait I also only use the left shift	Ah I see this is Google right What kinda side projects
before I got a mac which was a few years ago I did something even worse instead of using shift I had some obsession with capslock so I'd use capslock + key I wanted to capitalize + capslock thinking about making an app that involves video streaming or something	Holy Ooh interesting is there a specific video genre
Shopping 	shopping videos?
more like livestream shopping not sure yet	oh interesting so like your shopper doesn't steal your food? like instacart?
ummm more like taobao from china like live demo of products + q + a	oh interesting hmm
Shoooioot happy belated bday Head of hack!	Hiii Thank u very much
:p yee	LOL RIP hannah wants u to speak up more during general sir
I’ll try haha Most of the time during general meeting my sister and I working out so I’m multitasking 	LOL i see how it is
Dev I pay full attention since timing works out and it’s more relevant	also we should schedule a judging meeting sometime
Oh shoot	to talk about gavel and how we want to do judging in general
Wait when was the logs dev meeting Yeah we should	wait idk if that happened already
Justin mentioned it That judging will be discussed then	oh the sponsor ux meeting
But I couldn’t find it anywhere on hack calendar	do u want to be added there's a w2m out rn
Ye	ok i'll add you to the channel you're attending judging tn right i was hoping you could lead this meeting more to describe some of the features u want with gavel
Yup I’m attending I'd be willing to lead but I don't think the conversation will be driven by features we're building in gavel, but rather by how are things going to be different given jack's comments about judging, the design process of hack penguin, and themes from the hackerUX meeting also what does leading constitute of lol?	yeap i was hoping that we'd hone done on what the plan actually is for judging together that way u can discuss what's feasible for dev to do to handle the new changes i think it'd be nice for u to come with a small agenda of topics u think you'd need to know about when building gavel and the judging process on the dev side this year
Aight I’ll do that at 6ish when I get out	sure
Where do we put the meeting notes?	do u wanna make them and make a go link
How has summer been for ya?	dude i've been feeling like i'm in limbo everything is weird i haven't done much sometimes i get some inspiration and go hard for like a bit but most of the time i j chill how's work been
work has been slow and boring I think I'm never gonna go do corporate again lol anyways yea life has been kinda weird how are you staying in contact w mit people?	what kind of stuff u doing at work but rip yeah corporate what would u do otherwise uh tbh not much i'm in touch with hack friends a lot but that's about it
lol same the ppl who I have most recently texted are claire justin and jack	yeah it's really sad but i don't have like energy
and about gavel gavel and hackpenguin it's nice that you're hack head tho cuz you feel more involved and talking I literally joined UX meeting last night cuz I was feeling lonely and down and needed humans I think I'm gonna be trying to join like an early stage startup/maybe unicorn for the future... I feel like the work is more impactful then	we were so glad u spoke up hannah made a point of mentionoing you later while we were texting
"""we""??? bruh"	that's so cool like jack and hannah
I literally said one thing lol	have a gc w us LOL they were shook
whats so shocking? I can speak?	you're welcome to talk to me anytime tho btw i'm always j chilling at home LOL
ok I just feel that	they've been trying to increase team engagement for a while so just like
yooo	hearing others speak up with like nice
I feel like this is a huge thing like I keep tabs on who's speaking mentally lol and I feel like it's like 20% of the ppl doing 80% of the speaking	yeah it's not that we don't waant them to speak but just everybody else feels like they don't have to have a say or an opinion so i feel like they don't care
wait during general I think it's ok	yeah it's better in most committee meetings
I feel that the purpose of general meeting, ppl are just there to remember who's on hack lol I've told jack this before but I feel that some ppl prob don't even have to go to general but then this risks things being not as tight knit	yes but also
and a loss of the social aspect	we want to make sure like everybody is at least sort of updated on what's going on social aspect really suffering rn i wish we could do smth but it's just not the same
we had 0 retreats lol	I KNOW SO SAD can't believe both just
I would go on retreat if and only if there is a guarantee that there is a bed for me to sleep in lol that's like my only must have	i'm pretty sure our house had enough
so many ppl rsvp lol anyways yeah social aspect is interesting on hack I feel like getting in hack is mostly about how much you vibe with your interviewers if you vibe socially with them then you get in, and you echo that social vibe and it continues	oh that's an intersting note u make
like I don't think I was qualified by any means lol but I totally vibed with justin and jason	tbh same lol how did i end up here jason is my guy yeah i really vibe with those two too
during hack I got to be closer w jason and james and then they just leave!? I was so shook after	HAHA u picked the oldies yeah i'm sad they left
also i've been observing the gender ratio for clubs at MIT and it's quite itneresting for example in Scioly and Hack its more of a 70-30 split favoring females whereas in poker and hmmt its a 30-70 favoring males and startlabs is quite homogenous	i think like frat dominated groups would be more male leaning
oh true @SBC	and hmmt is math so rip
ripp	have u noticed that in like wait actually in poker what roles do the females have
last year co prez and CR out of the 5 roles this year no females took exec roles	yeah like someone said that like in traders all the girls were in logistical roles and ig possibly also the same in poker
I'm trying to recall... but I wasn't really involved in much logistics	yeah i'm not sure about poker
wait I just realized something did hannah assign hilary to guide photobooth discussion? *gasp this is all a ploy to encourage participation I like it!	she asked kat and hilary to lead discussion haha HAHA u exposed us
how long is hannah staying for?	shes leaving after hack 20 i expect most sophomores too to
why do ppl leave? this is so frustrating lol in poker ppl aren't considered alum unless they stay all 4 years lol	"oh shit really wdym ""stay"" like on board"
we have like alum retreat and spend money on alums and we don't consider ppl alums unless they are part of poker	well there's a lot of burnout associated with it
like yeah on committee	oh i see that's intense what if u don't join board until like sohpomore or junior year
ok yeah sophomore then stay 3 years	anyways the thing with hack is that once u organize hack a few times you're just exhausted from it
but I think only freshman and sophomores have joined...	i see
I feel like there's just so much to learn lol	well like
I'm also only on one committee so maybe I'm burning out at a slower rate	kevin is still on that's probably true
I feel like I wanna enjoy my chill time on dev	LOL literally kevin is like this
and then maybe try to run for dev head next year at some point	he doesn't want a head role but he wants to give a lot fo input
and when I done I go join marketting or something	oh that's be great illustrator
yee lol like many asian ppl I was once an art student tbh I see myself prob staying until like junior -senior year	:oooo yes i'm very excited
Sorry about the meeting:( Something came up in the middle and I had to leave rip	No worries haha We didn't finish We'll continue anothertime That one will be more dev focused allen judging meeting tn? want to continue leading
Tn? Yuh sure haha	haha thankss you should have come to bonding yesterday it was really fun
oh rip I'm been kinda busy lately	:(( nooo
i'm trying to find something to do w a gap semester but recruiting is just as bad lol if things don't work out I might be at school anyways lol	yeah i don't think i'd have anything to do in a gap semester most likely end up at school no matter what but also i could just fuck around and do nothing
I just really hope its pass fail and no credit limit then I can get a lot of stuff out of the way what happened at bonding yesterday?	LOL true played a kahoot game with the stuff from go/game
Can you remind me of the meeting goals	Identify dev tasks And further implemtation heyo sometime before general can u drop in your thoughts under meeting updates for judging at go/nm
Whoa this seems so cool	Yeah I talked to my other Korean friend about it last night and he said pangyo and FL would be good for me too
I’ve been to KIS pangyo when i was in high school and the school is pretty good—they don’t have the best facilities or anything but it’s a very well-known international school	All right coool Awesome
so the students you’ll be teaching there will most likely be very smart lol I never heard of future lab but i looked it up and it seems pretty interesting I feel like you can do more cool expts/workshops at future lab than kis pangyo if you’re more into that!	Hmm OK maybe I should rank FL earlier then? I have pangyo and then FL because I wanted to work in a school because idk if FL is super established yet But From what u said it might be
Yeah if you want to work at a more established institute, i’d also say kis pangyo would be a better choice just bc it’s a school that’s been around longer Also pangyo seems like a nice location since it’s a relatively new city and it’s close from seoul (if you want to travel!)	Yayyyy OK great I think I'd enjoy either one but yeah I hope I get it! We should catch up sometime btww
We should meet up if you get the chance to come in january And yesss	Omg yeahhh
I’ll probably stay in korea until mid-january	Oh shoooot That'd be so awesom to see u there
Yeahh I’ll take you to places when you’re not working	Omgggg wait we're acting like I'm going to get accepted hold up
Hahahahahaha I wish you the best of luck!!!	Thank uuuuuu HAPPY BIRTHDAY ALLY

Lol nice I’m glad	It was so intense bro like I can't even descrive
Reading that was probably the most exciting thing that I’ve done all day	Like my entire body temperature went up like 3 degrees and I started sweating profusely
LOL I can totally picture u doing that	Dude that was the most exciting thing that happened to me todah
AHAHA	Ughi know its so tragic I can't even kill a dumb bug right
U didn’t ask anyone to come in and help u find it ?	I asked my mom at first
Ok but like bugs are pretty sneaky so	She looked for two seconds Then was kike I gotta sleep good luck bro

No mines not until June 18 But I’m going for a research thing	oh shoot that's exciting yours or someone else's?
Nah not mine I emailed this lady and she’s letting me come in to volunteer/work at her place Not sure exactly what I’d be doing since she said she’d explain more in detail in person tomorrow since it’s difficult to do over email But it’s like working with kids and studying brain development	no way that's so cool amy making big moves is it with umich psych stuff? no way what if u meet celina
Nah says you fu Yea their lab is with umich which is partially why I wanted to do it so that I could continue it through the school year I think it’s more neuroscience Probably psych related too though Who’s that	celina cerf she's the aceing autism program director in ann arbor i think she's doing med school rn but she's a clinical psychologist or smth like that i can't really remember
Oh no way really at umich med school? That’s cool If I do I’ll tell you	yeah it's her first year of med school
Probably not though it’s pretty big	but i think she's off now
Does she know u	yeah ik her through aceing she's actually coming over on wed to pick up some stuff
Dang look at all these connections JAMIEFU	hey hey hey now i ain't got no lab to work in this summer i wish i could tho
lol so	smh i need to get a move on my life
U can make big moves at MIT plus	small fish big pond amy
Aren’t u doing some computer science thing in New York	? my research from last summer?
Or I thought u were applying to some computer programming thing	it's just an event not an actual thing how dope would that be tho if i had a real ass job or smth smh my parents don't want me to get a job this summer anyways i have like 3 placement exams to study for
What why nott Aiya	but i really wanna get a job like an internship job
You should	but nobody wants to hire me because i'm unqualified
If ur unqualified what are the rest of us Use ur connections jamie	more qualified
Aiya stop	bro i ain't got none
Just literally email around You know I did what u told me	to a company? LMAOOO yeah
Remember at hosa states u were like just email people I was like lol ok	yeah i would do that too but
So I did	ann arbor is far
Wait This is thanks to you	and even if i worked in a lab LMAO
Wow fu I owe you Thank you	omfg stop
Lunch is on me tomorrow Even though I can’t go	LMAO shutup
Come over and I’ll give u somemoney	cuz my parents want me to focus on like preparing but i want to do smth meaningful too so that kind of sucks ig idrk it's like weird
You will be preparing for something for the rest of ur life dude	like mit cuz they're like
U can’t not do something just cuz ur preparing for something else	if you feel fulfilled from your job then
Then u won’t be doing anything	you won't study it's just far that's all lmao
Ok but ur smarter than that	that's fake news
It’s REAL news	ughhhh i could try to go back to comerica but that's in auburn hills the commute is an hour every morning
Plus are u really going to feel fulfilled from ur internship	yes it takes a lot of time and work and then u get lazy as soon as u get hoome this is facts amy
And be like wow this is what I want to do for the rest of my life might as well just not strive for anything better	what my parents want me to find something relevant anyways ugh whatever man
Isn’t that prior experience though can’t u find something similar to that near here	in novi? getting an internship is different than finding a spot in a lab tho cuz there aren't postings for any internships esp not with my experience i think it might be better this way anyways idk i should focus on just a couple of things gotta become proficient in java before anyone wants to hire me
Or that works too Either way I believe in u jamie U can do it Lol I’m watching cantomando rn	hmm idk i just feel bad i don't have like smth concrete to do this summer yanno everything is super self motivated rn and i don't have any concrete tasks i watched their dumpling episode earlier today it was good i was really surprised they all quit their jobs
I mean it’s ok you’ve had stuff to do all other summers might be good to take a break Plus most people aren’t doing anything at all this summer so Wait yea same here I watched their video I don’t think I could ever do that	eh but like yanno that's why i want to do smth this summer my parents want me home tho so i can't go far ydah neither could i i probabbly wouldn't want to anyways very brave
Yea probably cuz ur not going to be home for the next four years I know right	amyyyyyy
Jamieeeeeeeeee	ugh you know what i'm just going to learn java this summer so it's easier for me to get a job later feelsbadman
Hey no that’s a good plan	amyyyyy why is computer science computer science that's it i'm switching out
Lol what Why would u do that	it's tooo hardddddd
fu everything is hard If it were easy anyone could do it U gotta use ur smart brain juices	amy i don't like your practicality stop this right now
Ok fine Quit	AMY STOP USING RHETORIC
AHAHA Seriously though just relax this summer it’s well deserved	AMHYYYYYY i have been so stressed for weeks actually like not highkey but lowkey and idk what to do
Why? Because of ur summer stuff?	yeah like i have to learn all this stuff but its all like self motivated
What stuff like java?	Yeah And bio And chem And python
That’s good you can train yourself to be more proactive Why so much	no creds
Do ur ap tests not count	Nah
So then there was no point ?	Yah Fun ik
Wow that sucks I mean I’m sure u remember enough of it that you don’t need to study that hard Like it’ll come back to you faster	Hopefully
Lol so we got lost but now we know where we are it’s gonna take us like 15 min to get to ur house is that ok	Lmaosure

JAMES FU HELLO HAPPY HAPPY BIRTHDAY YAYAYAYAY 🥳🥳	HI AMY THANK YOU ugh i'm sorry we haven't texted in quarantine i'm bad at keeping in touch but let's make sure to do that from now on lol
Nah it’s ok I haven’t really been talking to many people either I realized I’m kind of a loner and don’t need much social interaction to survive lol Saranya and I might be calling tomorrow though if you want to join Anyways any exciting plans	lowkey as long as there's a few people same and like i don't talk to my parents much during the day since i have meetings but the physical prescence is all that i need ugh idk like i want to talk to people and know more people but sometimes i just don't not sure what tmwr looks like yet tbh but i'm more free sunday u can meet some of my mit friends u didn't meet last time too i think i might be calling them
Lol dude that’s relatable are you taking classes rn Man you’re a busy woman Oh shoot really hm maybe that’s intimidating	Nope I just finished last Wednesday thank god They're not intimidating trust me
Are you not taking spring classes? What are you’re plans Also hello you can join our call if you would like We’re calling rn	ayooo lol i'm about to go to bed tho i'll text u tmrw if i end up calling my other friends and we can have a party no i'm not taking anything over the summer just doing remote research hi amy this is my official check in with you how are u doing
Hello hello I am ok Your Facebook post was very well said I appreciate you How are you doing	aw thanks what r u up to these day i'm j chillin
Honestly nothing much I’m just taking classes all day and then my family and I play mahjong every night And then I do Chloe ting	Hats that Aw that's so nice
She’s this workout person on YouTube I just do her workouts otherwise I’d just be sitting in my bed all day Wbu what are you doing	wow that's liek 10x more exercise than i do
LOL you should do it with me it’s fun	:ooo I'm not that good
That’s ok man the first time I did it my butt hurt so much I couldn’t sit on my chair LOL But now my butt doesn’t hurt anymore So that’s PROGRESS	LOL My butt kept hurting the first few times I went biking
That’s improvement dude You should keep on biking	Im over it now Ive decided I'll just be unhealthy And unathletic
nooo:(( Where did you bike??	Just around the sub
You should bike to my sub	I haven't left in 3 months That is so incredibly far
And we can hang out 6 ft apart	T.T Rip
You can do it	No like physically I would not be allowed to go on such a trek They're like what if a car hits u Too many people Too far
Hm makes sense See that’s where Chloe ting comes in You can exercise in the comforts of your own home	Noooooooo I don't wannaaaaa What r u doing this summer
Idk yet my original plan was to volunteer and research but everything is closed for nonessential people So still figuring stuff out What about you	yeah all my plans got cancelled so that's a rip so i'm doing remote research for the summer and working on some projects on the side not that those have gotten very far yet
Oh wait that’s cool what research are you doing?	it's supposed to be detecting news bias but it's not really working out so far
What why not?	I think our research is kinda not it Like our lab isnt well organized
Does the head person not do anything about it	Oop Sorry im just seeing this I think he's a primary cause of the chaos
Man that sucks is it too late to join another lab	Eh probably It's fine I'm getting paid to do nothing
LOL that’s always good I didn’t know you were interested in news bias	lol i don't follow the news enough so this is kind of a good way to get more into it
It’s like ap Lang kinda I never followed the news until I took that class	oop same and i stopped right after
Ahaha me too I just try to listen to a podcast everyday	oh that's really smart what are some good podcasts like i don't listen cuz i feel like everything other than like basic news is either not covering everything or not interesting like non-news podcasts
Omg oops sorry I forgot to respond But like I just listen to like those 4-15 min news podcasts I also occasionally listen to this asian podcast for fun with Philip wangs fiancé and two other asian girls and they just talk about random stuff some is like cultural experience related and some is just other random stuff Idk if that made any sense lol that was really bad English	Oh huh that's ibteresting Maybe I should give that a shot
Yeayea do you have any recommendations	Hmm the only podcast I actually stuck w and listened to was RobinHood snacks daily But I don't listen to that anymkre
Robin Hood snacks?? What’s that	Robinhood is the investing app Snacks is like the name of their podcast These two guys talk about companies and their stocks and how well they're doing They pick like 3 a day to talk about I stopped a while ago tho
Oh what the that’s intellectual stuff I also don’t do stocks lol but I should probably learn	lol same i used to listen to it so i could learn a little here and there but i've recently beeen soooo out of it
Aw why	Just cuz I'm lazy
LOL well I mean if there’s any time to be lazy I guess quarantine would be the time	f i'm not tryna be i just am
Oh I was wondering why you messaged me It should be like 1:15 max??? But don't worry if you can't stay for the entire time	do i need to dress nicely i want to tho i'll be there :D
Nope you don't need to bring anything or dress anything specially! Thank you I appreciate that :)	oki :DD i'm excited to hear u play
Don't get your hopes up	r u going to have like a break time or time to give a speech or anything people who hold like senior recitals and dances must be so tired even holding a grad party is tiring
Yeah I'm gonna talk and stuff Not for too long. And I might have an intermission idk	oiiiii noice
It depends on how tired I am	got it got it
Thank you for this tho :))))	well i'll try to be there the entire time and if not i'll let u know ofc certainly wait kind of a weird question but like are my parents allowed to stop by or anything
Of course ! Why not ??? Idk if it's an inhibiting factor but not too many other parents will be there I think, maybe a few But they're certainly welcome	ok i'll see if they want to go then cuz they like going to concerts and stuff like that so i feel like they might enjoy your playing esp my dad lmao
Oh really??? Dude I had free tickets to like almost all the dso concerts this year	oh shoot wow well that's in detroit too so
Trueeeeeeeee Not always But most of the time yeah	oh hmm ok well that's alright

Nppp	Btw ry working this summer
Nooo I'm not	U quit China cafe?
Yeah	Was it a good experience
Definitely	Well then that's good Why'd u quit
I was struggling with my grades Like even if I hadn't worked I'd still be struggling So ofc I had to drop it	Was this like Diff eq
And plus I was starting to hate some of the workers Yeah diff eq And physics	Damn u reminded me about physics Well shit now I gotta worry about scores too
Yeah same I reminded me about physics	Lmao
I'm screwed for it lol	Did u end up taking the e and m makeup
Yeah	And… ?
It was alright	Wow that's better than I can say for myself You're in good shape then
Yeah but mechanics Was the definition of rape	Oh Thats ok The curve is pretty good
The moment I read this I immediately thought of something inappropriate to say :))))	Is it because it's me or because youre just dirty like that Glad u didn't say it tho
You're curves are good too Bet	Well
It's def cuz of you	U done messed up the grammar
But also I'm dirty Yeah your*	Well
Whoopsies I almost never do that ripperoni	Thanks I guess
Wanna see a picture of A friend of mine	Who And why Would u ask me that
That just finished freshman year at curtist Institur of Music and was placed on the sublist for the PSO	I don't understand the musician talk But If u want Which one
The quality is so ass thanks photographer but The good looking dude on the far right	Well Thanks for the picture I've now become acquainted With this friend To an extent
I said Far right	I never imagined Omfg Alright bye
What why	Since when R u
What???	A friend of u
LOL It's the dude on the far left btw Sublist means when the Philadelphia Symphony Orchestra needs a substitute player, they call up a certain number of people	Oh shoot
To see if any of them can fill in for that concert	But he's like Young
Yeah it's dope Yeah He's insane tho	Wow
Actually nuts He's ridiculous	I'll take your word for it
Yeahhhh I like don't even understand But whatever I'm still gonna brag about him I kinda miss talking to you	We don't really talk over text tho Its like Weird conversations always
No	We haven't really talk talked
Disagree We don't need to always have deep conversation in order to consider it talking Brb	Well That's not what I mean But I just feel like whenever we text It's like The things we talk about are either just for the purpose of banter or just like Silly
I enjoy it Usually I call if I want to talk about Other things ig Sometimes I'll have convos but Idk I didn't want to disturb you during the school year	Oh see that's kind of interesting tho
Why	Most people like to text these days Which honestly like I do a lot of too
Oh	But not like On the go If I have an immediate question I call
I like calling soooo much more	Yeah U can multitask
Oh not just that	And not move your fingers
I don't usually multitask too much when I call	Oh
If I am I'm playing league or sth But league takes a lot of brain power So Hey one sec I just realized I left all my laundry in the dryer Shttttt Brb	Lol I need to learn about league a little bit I feel like I hear u guys talk about it all the time But I know notbing But idk I guess I was kind of busy during the school year so I didn't call too often I probably could've on late physics nights I never get as much work done when I call tho OK see I like working with people but I'm so inefficient when I do that I feel like the only person ive ever worked next to that has actually like motivated me to work more is Leon Yeah typing takes a lot of work and it's hard to convey inflection
I don't ever call while I'm doing work Unless Narayan is helping explain something That's it I don't get anything done in a call	Lol maybe not to that extent But same
Yeah I get nothing 0 So I decided to try these boxers I got from the senior party Also because the rest of my clothes is in the laundry But also cuz why not And it's Too big	I got boxers too! I got one of the last smalls bless Theyre green and they have pretzels on them and my mother does not approve™
ohhhhh I went later so	Yeah I went like Right in the middle And dug through that box
Ah okay Yeah there were like two mediums But they were Whack	Lol
So I got these even wackier ones	Nice
I would show you but I realized I'm wearing them and that's kinda strange But they also don't feel like boxers	They're more like shorts
They're like long enough to be shorts	Just like
Yeah	Regular shorts
Yeah	You're so spontaneous sometimes
So do you wanna call rn for a few minutes or no	I would be too lazy to try on something at 3am Eh I'm about to go to bed
Oh no im gonna wear them to sleep now	I'm getting up at 630 tmrw so
Yeah me too	Loll
Why are you?	Thags a good idea Wait why r u
I need the car	I just have to take my brother to the bus stop
So I'm dropping my mom off at work	I'll be going back to sleep after Well Hopefully
I might also do tgat	Hopefully not actually I should fix my sleep schedule
I've been running and I feel proud of myself	Before I ruin my entire summer
Yeah I need to	Omg I kind of want to all the time But I'm weak and lazy
Yeah my days are so much longer when they're early Dude everybody is lazy It hurts so much to run two laps around Churchill dude Like especially because it's two laps Because after the first lap you're given the option of going home	And u know u could stop after the first? Yeah I can imagine the feeling lmaooo
So I'm probably gonna start finding other paths to run It's so hard dude	But You'll get your reward for it
Hopwfully I want to lose some weight and gain it back in muscle	I kind of feel
I think I probably need to lose like 40 points tho if I want the body I want before muscle gaining Which is not feasible So I guess I'll go halfway with that Maybe I can lose 20 pounds idk it'll be my greatest accomplishment if I do end up losing the weight	R u actually like over the average weight rn tho
Yes I dont look like it do i	No Not really
Yeah Oh so I kinda look overweight ?	R u nitpicking my words right now
Nono I'm serious	No U don't
What do I look like ??? Jw	Average
Cuz I'm pretty lucky with my facial structure - there was so much room for fat Like if I was skinnier my face would be very structured ithink Like back when I had a really nice jawline	Lol I have no idea what you're talking about
Back when I was a cute boy Rip	U analyze yourself too much You're still a cute boi
No No	OK fine let's not do this whole denying thing
This is called fiction Yeah I was a nice little boy With less fat and more motivation LOLOLOLOL ANYWAY so I ran today	Lol I mean u can't have it all
Yes you can	You're not even like Fat No u can't
Yeah but you are	Wow I feel like I was just betrayed
Lol fatty	Again
LOL	Thank God I have the self esteem to combat this
I do not	What to do with a mean andrew Actually I was about to tell u this You are one of the few people Where I'm like If he's mad He won't hold back He has a lot of capacity To be mean
This is very true	So it's a little scary sometimes I n t I m I d a t I n g
Usually I'd be offended but 1. It's not that offensive and 2. I completely agree and am aware of this	Lol I felt like u knew too Idrk
Yeah lol	Its not like Oh I should be like scared of 247
I'm not gonna kill anybody But I'm an angry boy I'm just very emotional	U have very little room for people's shit lmao
I cry really easily too though LOL	No wau
That's the True*	I've never seen u cry
I cry so fucking easily Like Way too easily L like	OK ngl after I got into hs
It's bad but also nobody can tell during the movies	I cried a lot easier too
Or during speeches	Oh whale No shame
I started crying more my sophomore year	Reason?
Hard to explain But part of it has to do with being with Val sort of It's like something else came along with being with val But yeah	R u guys on like good terms Or no
Also I think going to my freshman year of all State No Going to my freshman year of all State really messed me up emotionally It was such a good fucking year fuck	Wait I'm so confused Having a good year Messed u up?
Yeah I became so much more emotional And like I always think back to those days because they were so great	Oh wow
Andi haven't had a great day like that in a long time	Kind of the nostalgic type?
Very I also get extremely intense cases of deja Vu It's very strange	That's interesting
And it literally gives me a mini crisis	Like Existential?
Yes Like What the fuck what the fuck what the fuck For a fleeting koment	What's your 16personality thing
Moment And then it's gone Intp??? Logician	Damn youre so much different than I originally thought Like Not recently Like way before
It's probably changed from the time I took it I knew you would comment on that	About Everything?
Like how you thought I was different	Yeah U seemed like it tho Like Whenever u argue w me You're always very rational
We don't usually talk so now all of this comes at once Hmm	And like logic bam bam fact here
Oh oh	Fact there
You're talking about my logician Personality type	No
Yeah I see that	Just like In general
Oh Okay okay Yeah I see that	Between u saying you're emotional and like How u behave sometimes
But there's like layers it's weird isn't it	But I also kind of get it Yeah
I think it's possible that I'm extremely complex as a human being Typing that out just Made me chuckle And also gave me a strange feeling	U microanalyze everything too it's just so crazy Like u understand yourself on certain points and I'm just like I human
That's probably why I can't focus very well	And that's it
Lollllll Yeah I think about things too much It's very distracting I'm just so very emotionally attached	I was about to tyoe Think less But then o was like That doesn't make much sense
Nice! 	OK idk if you'll like to hear this
I don't really mind	But it some ways you're similar to Zoe Like
Say what you'd like to say Interesting	OK so right off the bat U guys of very different first of all
Honestly the fact that you said idk if you'll like to hear this is what made it worse	Because your values and lifestyles and manner of living is very different Oh
What put you under the assumption that I don't like Zoe's personality or that I don't like to be associated with hey personality	Was it bad to say thag
C'mon now protein Princeton*	Well o was under the impression that u guys didn't like each other
No??? I guess it's just her	Oh Sorry to break it to u then friend
LOL no I had heard it before	But like Zoe is hurt very easily
She doesn't like me because she thinks I don't like her because I only talk to pretty girls or girls I can get things from	And she thinks too hard But about people Ohhhhh that is true
Which is kind of true but..... Like.... Idk	She says you're only nice to people u respect
Oh	And that u don't respect her
Hmm I think I'm pretty nice I definitely don't show intentional disrespect to get Her	I mean your style of joking around is too much for her tho She doesn't get it
Only people I show blatant disrespect to is people who disrespect me first I don't even joke around her dude Like not at all	I guess maybe it seems like u brush her off then
Whatever anyway Yeah I do	Eh I don't really know
But it's not because of her lol she just overthinking it I'm like that to you too sometimes	YEAH
But I only brush her off when she's like	u are like that to me
OOOHHHHHHHH I LOVE YOU ANDREW	LOLL What
Like if course she shouldn't expect me to be like	When has she said that to u
OMG ZOE I LOVE YOU TOO Like weed	LOL
Wtf*	that kind of made me laugh out loud
Like she acts like that and expects something similar in return	That's OK some people just don't match well with others
It's not gonna happen though and she should know that Just because I'm not going for ahug with her every five seconds	She's someone who needs a lot of love
Or telling her that were best friends She's dating somebody now Also SO DO BO SO DO I * I NEED SO MUCH LOVE DUDE	SURPRISINGLY U DO NEED A LOT OF ATTENTION
I GET SO FUCKING JEALOUS SHE'S NOT THE ONLY FUCKING ONE	LOLLL
YOU LAUGH NOW	That's why people are different Wow This is so fascinating
UNTIL YOU SEE ME CRYING MY EYES OUT IN COLLEGE BECAUSE I MISS MY PARENTS OR MY FRIENDS OR BECAUSE I COULDN'T FIT IN WITH ANY FRIENDS GROUPS	OK wait don't do that to yourself already lmao
There are many things I've done to myself :))))))))))))	Tjat Was A huge Shift And I was unprepared
It could mean Two very different things	Oh You're right
Which one did you think it was?	Well I usually expect The dirty one So
Btw we need to quickly switch back to the topic you bright up but didn't get to finish earlier	Which one
Cuz were gonna forget why we started talking about zoe And my personality	Oh Yeah like You're similar in that you feel everythinf Like Very strongly
Okayyyy I see Was there more to this analysis?	Idrk
You said I was similar in many ways so	It just kind of had to do with
???	How u guys look very different on the surface
Ohhh	But underneath yalls brains thinking so hard Idk r u the type of get real upset if someone doesn't like u tho
Playing devil's advocate Zoe kinda seems like the type to be very emotional though Hell yes	Oi then u guys are similar there too No she is
I want everybody to like me	Like I don't hear much from you
I want everybody to give me spotlight I want everybody to prioritize me That is	But Zoe she gets so upset when people don't like her
Me too	And although she knows u can never please everybodh She wants to so badly
Me too. But I don't show it	Yeah Build up your self confidence andrew
Like	U got this
Dude it's hard I've got so much not going for me it's actually really difficult	Wdym
Like remember we always had talks about how I was insecure about my looks Well looks is one thing I'm still not over that, but there's so much more that really ruins my self confidence	We're not perfect human beings
It's not really something I can just tell you out of the blue???? Ig but it's there for sure	At some point we gotta accept the fact that There are limited beautiful and handsome faces in the world And nobody decent gives a shit anyways So like fuck that shit man Make some potato memes out of your face
Wtf	Name yourself jimmyfood
Um	Idrk what to say sorry But like Fuck that shit man
"LOL no you're good It's just That I do? Care about looks... So it's hard to just ""fuck that shit man"""	I mean like everybody does a little bit
Like I value it in others too	Glad u think I'm a little good looking then Lol Ok but facts tho man Who doesn't
And also I believe that I as a human being without plastic surgery have the potential to look better than I currently do so I'm never satisfied I never said that ^^^ :))))	Hmm How do u fee like
What	U would go about changing that then Because honestly if there's nothing like
My main thing is fixing my smile	Concrete u think u should change
That's my number one	How so
I'm not sure I need to practice it But I also need to find one I like	Well U got a whole summer to do that So Smile away Although I will say
Lol I've got my whole life to do that	I feel like a lot of this pressure Is self induced
Yeah for sure	Cuz ain't nobody thinking ANYTHING about your smile
I want to look good No people do know	Your goals for self realization
My natural smile is fine	Are too lofty for us peasants
I like my natural smile It's the picture smile People actually notice it's bad And I ofc despise it a lot of times Sometimes it's good but that's rare	That is a HARSH word Wow U feel very intensely about this OK but also like SELF ACCEPTANCW
Yeah it's been a problemo for	Love your foddamn seld
WHY SETTLE IF I HAVE AN ALTERNATE OPTION	I have come to the acceptance That my eyes will always appear small in pictires
I'm not ready to settle because I know I can change	And my smile will always make my face look fat And it's like
Oh I'm pretty lucky about eyes I think	Whatevermam
My smile makes me look fat but sometimes it doesn't So I strive for those	OK I give up If u have a goal Then
Hehe Yeah!	U can achieve I'm going to slee
There are definitely some things	P I'm cashed out man But
That I'm insecure about that are dumb and unreasonable But for now this one I'm not quite willing to give up	Yeah Get rid of those dumb an unreasonable things Love your goddamn self
I'll do my best	Good night Sleep tight
Gn and good luck walking up tomorrow Good night	Well I wonder why it'll be so difficult Lmao Good nifjt R u awake If not that would make sense But remind me tmrw morning that I had a question for u
I am awake why  ?	Oh Okay
What's up ?	So a friend of mine just broke up with his gf Because he thinks they won't have a future together because they're going to different unis next year And he doesn't want to drag it out and just hurt her more later But he's real sad about it and they both really like each other Was it right for him to do that
That's the same thing that happened with val ajd i And i	He doesn't think long distance will work Wekl What do u think
It almost never does	Is it worth giving it a shot Theyre 3 hrs away by train
The thing is I know of a story where they tried and it worked for a little bit But then eventually It ended badly	What about abhi and anjali And Robert and Lucia
Yeah they lasted for 1 year in college then in the summer or sth They ended badly	Oh abhi and anjali? Welp
Whar No I'm saying The story I gave They lasted for a year and then ended really badly Mine also ended badly even tho I did the same thing and tried to avoid it from ending badly But	Oh But I feel like my friend is just scared of that happening Should he at least try Because they've been together for almost 3 years now
I think it's still the better move because you should have a higher chance of ending well if you end it while you like each other you know I mean I was with val for 2	Hmm They're both real sad tho And there's like An entire summer So And he's like clean cut so idek if they'll still be friends after this
Oh Yeah that's what happened with val and I Idk. I'm not an expert, but mine ended badly because I didn't know how to handle the breakup And she was kinda mean too	OK I see
But by concept idk	I told him to sit on it for a few days And see which one he'd regret more
I think the way Val and I did it is the better way but idk I don't have much evidence ig is what I'm saying	To me it just seemed so sudden yanno like
Yeah	This occurred less than 2 hours ago Idk if he's just like In a funk Or if he really means it
It was way too sudden for me too .	Ig it always seems that way
Letting him sit on it is always the safer option ofc But it's like Eventually you're going to have to address it	I mean He already broke up w hee But yeah they didn't really like Conclude the conversation Either
Oh what the duck really	So
Wtf Okay Val and I had it planned lol For a while	No it seemed like she wasn't expecting it
Jeez... That's rough Honestly tho	Sad vibes
Relationships are so hard dude.	He said
Like they're so fucking difficult	Yeah fr OK I wouldn't know
I could literally still cry over my relationship if I was in a bad spot in life	Oh I'm sorry to hear that
It's just so frustrating because Like honestly Idk what the best option is I know of people who break up and are still friends But I also know of Val and I Who struggled to separate and then still liked each other But then she got over it and I didn't So she started hating me and I was acting dumbly And we ended off on no speaking terms And a lot of tears for me	Yeah I see what you're saying
But like it doesn't always end like that That's why there's never a best choice ig Evey single relationship is unique and deserves its own unique analysis	I guess in the end he should just make a decision and stick w it? Yeah
Yeah.	Oof Okay Thanks andy
If he's not like me he and he's not clingy and insecure Then he'll get over it eventually If he's like me, then wish him the best of luck Because it's been 10 months and I still low-key kinda struggle sometimes. I don't like Val anymore don't get me wrong	:(((
But that's because I see her now and I don't want to be with that But I miss how she was when we were together So I kinda miss.......somebody who doesn't exist anymore ? Like somebody died LOL	Oh that's like a real thing tho
Yeah lol	Understandable
Weird vibes	MOVE ON
Sad reacts	Life's got bigger and better things for u
It's fine I'm ready for other things	Time only moves forward
It's just annoying sometimes	Get that bread
Uh I mean. I can try	Good
I think once I meet somebody else who likes me back	U do u
I'll forget or sth	Does it have to just be A romantic relationship tho Like
But since Val I have gotten zero interest from anybody so the only thing I can hold on to is my last relationship	I definitely think u can move past it
Well guys don't do the trick all the time	Without a new one Like Being w other people
I miss being treated as the number one priority	Platonically or romantically

oh lmao wait how do they do that now how does that work take my hands now you're the cuase of my euphoria	thanks but no thanks?
when im with you	also i forgot to respond
im in utopia	i was in the middle of a response it's zoom zoom style cpw
zoom zoom like a car?	zoom zoom like a zoomm university
oh shoot are you busy rn?	huh? um i just got off a call but i don't have anything until 5pm
actually shooot nvm actually	lol ok
you're weird	so are you
I’m not gonna dent that lol Deny	good
I’ll take it as a compliment	that's optimistic of u
im quite a pessimistic person tho	i know stop it
no u i am quite confused now	what why
because you're too smart with your MIT brain	Uhhh No
Your brain is confusing Because you’re so smart And I’m a dumb Ass	uh nah
nah he is a HUGE dumbass	who he lol sorry we never got to call that one time
Wait which time?	i forget
oh okay i do not remember	me neither
goodie the messenger app for windows is surprisingly good lol	there's an app now? i've been using a chrome shortcut i make open in a new window

Tell me Have u seen a sunset turn into a sunrise?	is this from a song that's depressing won't it come up from the opposite horizon tho so technically it won't turn into it you'd have to turn your head
Lol wait I didn’t think of that But what if you face the south That means u can see both in ur peripheral Hehe	Peripheral is peripheral It's not called watch8ng
But ur still using ur eyessss I guess we don’t really have eyes tho	Rip U really did that to us
Lol I have no shame dude No shame wanna help me with something? idk python well enough. how does this work lol piles is a list of numbers and H is just a number	wow i've never seen <= used in python before for all p in piles get p-1/K and sum them all up then i think that's a pointer and return a pointer to it sorry late response
lol nah its okay	sorry forgot the +1
but doesn't sum take in a list	was it right was it actually a pointer yeah so for p in piles
oh huhhhh does that create a new list then?	u can like compute p-1/K + 1 for every item in piles like not anything u can reference but yeah basically it'll sum up all the computed values
ahh i see so wait im just curious can you do like newList = sum(... for p in piles)	yeah
WAIT DISTRGARD THAT i meant newList = ... for p in piles	uhhhhh i think so it's just syntactically short for it you know
i see interesting. i like that hehe	python has a lot of shortcuts i don't really use lol makes the code less readable
yea i feel the same way	i once saw my friend put an entire coding problem in one line it was kind of ingenious nobody understood it tho
lol that is WILD pretty cool tho	yeah python is nice because it doesn't waste your time with syntactical things means we're all a bunch of high level noobs tho
hehe better than sitting there and doing it urself dude i was writing this coding question in python and c++ python was literally half the lines omg	yeah facts fuk pointers
lmao fuck delete i rather it get auto deleted garbage collection :)	wait what i have no idea what you're saying anymore but

What is the mit personality	well personally i think the outsider perspective if different from whata i think but from your perspective the mit personality is nerdy and a bit strange
Okay a little but sure *bit And what’s your perspective?	They just crazy We all crazy Some are nerdy But then others are just like Party all day Every day is their last
Omg you MIT guys are too wild So which one are you	I'm a pretty cautionary mit student

Oh huh Is that what kids nowadays do? Interesting Wow I’m old	He's just into video games
Watch someday or one day It’s so good	what is it
A drama WATCH IT 	OKAY
YES LETS GO	Is it cheesy romance
its really not its so deep literally top 10 asian drama of all time	Okay I'll take a look when I have time then
YAYYYYY its probably my favorite of all time	oh wow really oh i've been seeing all the osts for thisi on spotify
omg wow you're unbelievable now you actually have to watch it BUT ON THE OSTs, THEY ARE SO FUCKING GOOD   is literally #1 in Taiwan on spotify	Lolllll Okok
so are you going to watch it?	Yeah probably sometime
yessssss DO IT WE CAN FANGIRL TOGETHER	Lollll Alright alright
Is Aaron Huang the same person as Erin shi? This is a legit question	no
They look same same	What No
Okay nvm We are going nowhere with this	Yes I agree
Talk to me about smth serious	ok i'm working on a few web apps rn not actually making real progress
what kind of apps for what?	Just react flask web apps
oh you already know flask and react? thats pretty impressive	not that well i just know a little bit here and there i figure u know it as welll plus i always just use bootstrapped templates to set up react
Well I took a class on web systems so I know a little I’m honestly very not good at web LOL NICE I feel like that’s the way to go with react	Eh same Idk what else is there to learn that is immediately applicable to cool projects
Honestly that’s pretty true	Create-react-app just makes the boilerplate So that's nice
Web is pretty easy to get into LOL yea exactly No setup required Actually I don’t remember Does it setup web pack for you?	What's web pack
It like builds the Js/react package You probably just use something different then How are you displaying it on a website?  Maybe you can use it sometime For fun	What do u mean it
Wait you’re making a web app right? How are you displaying it on a browser As you’re making it	Oh ok you're asking what server it's running on So create react app installs react-scripts And I just looked at its list of dependencies It does use web pack At least for a dev server
Oh yea that’s a better word for it I couldn’t think of it lol Ohhhh I see Ya that makes sense	Yeah idk anybody that uses it directly tho They just use react-scripts
Oh wait I didn’t know that I use it directly lol But I put it in a makefile	That means you're good
LOL NO It’s just cause I was taught that way React scripts is probably smarter tho	U should teach me sometime I gotta sleep now tho
LOL	But let's continue this interesting conversation tmrw
Okay good night Wow so this is an interesting convo?	Yes Absolutely Good night to u too Lol met James today for two seconds He was so Not amused by me
LOL HOW CAN U TELL He dared me to do it	Dude he was so deadpan He was like Wtf
And he didn’t believe I actually would	Hi I guess Dude
LOL	U do it all the time
True Hehe Also why do I feel like all my friends are named like James or	U have one friend named james Another named jamie Are there more
Wait no like 5 James LOL	Oh Fair enough That's a common Asian name
True true Why are Asians like this	Basic af OK actually gn this time This is it Done
Lol okay	Gn
Good night babe ;) Jkjkjk Hehe	Omg Ok gn
Gn You missed a video chat with little goon LULU.	sory in a meeting
:( OMG MEETING UR BOYFRIEND?	for hack
Oh Yikes Bro bro bro bro	what's up
im bored but i have work to do	rip that's life
 why am i like this HEHE APPLE CARD couldn't resist	wow you have so many cards
lol wait its not that many tho	that's a lot
i mean, its mostly just like membership stuff and coupons	yeah u have many of those
lol yea cause im cheap	i mean yeah same but that's a lot
LOL im also lazy so would rather put it on my phone rather than carry in person	You look like A true Gen Z
LOL what the actually you know what ill take it as a compliment Wow did u just leave me on read?	Oops I didn't mean to It was a compliment Truly
why do i feel like you are being sarcastic	i would never
  	ok
 	sorry i can't understand this
	what
what	what
hat WHAT	nvm
im confused now	Me too
	This took me like 3 hours
Whoa that looks pretty good Did you make the boba from scratch?	Yeah But I didn't cook it for long enough this time
oh lmao oh well now you know for the next time	It's too tiring idk if there will be a next time
why not what else do you have to do you know	Lol I could learn some stuff
LMAOOO so true like any remark he makes somehow	Why do I feel like
belittling	He's looking down on me Yeah what the FUCK
are u sure @jame LOL	I can't I just feel like I want to punch him sometimes but the guy is a frickin twig it'll look like I'm beating up some middle schooler
jamie*	Yeah why would he say that
lolol just be like yes i'm sure	Smh
u know his family gave me a combined $200 for my grad party	Im disappointed by how much he thinks he knows What the shit
aAFTER inviting themselves	Uhhhhh
and paying me to dance at his  yea lol	Holy shit You're gonna be at his?
but he probs knows alot since he knows alot of ppl going just no need to be belittling about it	Cuz he asked me if o was going to his
yea his moms paying us rip are u?	OK yeah I agree he knows a bit but why does it make his opinion always right I told him Uhhhhh
yea exactly	Yeah probablu If I cant I'll try to stop by
I am pleasantly surprised however	I don't want to go fuckkk
that he even answered my questions about which advising to do instead of being shady about it	Lmao first time ik
then don't, i'll def just leave after dancing	It takes a while to get the answers out of him usually
exactly oh no it has commenced again	Lmfaooo Wow I can't
the thing is idk enough to defend my answer lOL	There we go He's gonna have something to say tho You're right thi I mean they talk about the average number of people in each learning community each yesr And some of them aren't even app based But they're only around 50 usually So it can't be as crucial as Ajay says For a great college experience
yea it def isn't	Ajay is just someone Who wants to find a group of people
and ngl, concourse seems like the biggest load of bs	Who will like him fast
yea LOL	Yeah I need to look into more
and where he can be w a group of people he deems as superior to the rest	YEAH What the fuck u can't drop out of concourse????
but concourse actually is just like, okay you will discuss science implications on humanity that's cool what else you can't drop out of these things	It's like a weekly sem too right
i believe so yea	OK why do I need a specific 49 other people to discuss this with tho I'll ask around tho
Yea lol exactly Everyone I ask says diff things / doesn’t reply	I only have 2 people to ask so I feel like You're doing much better than me I'll let u know tho And if u find anything else out Plz hmu
Bro I know nothing lol Yea I will	Bro
I’ll give updates tonight I’m waiting on some stuff	Do i Okay yah lmk
Esg seems good tho Maybe	I am not opposed to a learning community As long as I feel like Confident That it'll be good
The thing is I’m not confident Bc I have a feeling These all seem good on paper But then when u actually do them, they’re a waste of time and repetitive	OK so advising sems are only first semester And then your advisor just approves shit for u after that And it's pass no record So It's all right
Yea What about traditional advising No credits	No credits
 Which course stuff have u already sent MIT /can I use the descriptions u sent them For this thing	I never sent a description? Just a syllabus and the form
Kk I got it thanks tho So they rejected when you tried asking for diff eq credit right	Uhhh Yeah No fourier Low-key the form WAS super quick But Ajay kept asking me for it He texted me a few weeks ago asking where it was too and I said oh just search up math transfer credit online and it's right there But then he was like Oh can't u just send yours And I was like uhhhhh no? It's really quick and I'm not at home rn? And then he asked again today and I was like Are u just Not capable of finding it Or not capable of filling out Two lines worth of info
Lolol It took me like 2 mjn I think he’s not used to people denying him stuff LOL Wait have u signed up for 18.03 ASE yet	I don't know if I'm going to take it Yet
O I don’t even see a sign up for it anywhere	R u U have to request to take it
Depends How request it tho Bc if wasn’t on the ASE sign up	U have to email the person It's on the ase schedule thing in the office of first year page

Fuck I’m sorry :(( it doesn’t even matter just keep being amazing 	Congtats thooo You're going to stop by innovation initiative today?
Yep we have a group of us Setting up a stand there and all	perfect tysm how did innovation initiative go
It was fine we set up a booth and one person talked to us Wait were you going to assign me to a grant?	Yeah there's an innovation initiative grant
Oh kk What exactly do I do w it	Also out of curiosity do u know who else got mcg Uhhh U submit it
No clue So you? Do*	Nope Lol It's on the finance knowledge base doc Sent in the slack a few weeks ago
I’ll tell you once I find out Kk will look into that	Yee Lmk if we can get sum money

What time does it start/end	11 to 4 baker foundation update?
Brendan never replied to my email 	Can u fill out as much as possible For mission and stuff there's budget defenses To look at as samples

Wait wya	hi baker foundation update?
Working on it rn Should funding period be fall? And should I make primary contact Brendan or Wilson	Brendan Fall Availability best for me post 4pm mondays
And what is project budget total and requested amount?	Oh actually let me check with this and I can let u know in an hour put 2500 for now for requested amount what's the context for project budget total like how much we need for it?
I think it means how much total are we spending on it as a club And do we have a complete, itemized budget for the fall idea factory	no not yet can you set up a meeting with the events team, me and you to discuss this this will help us a lot we don't need to have this in by any specific date but we should continue to work on this over the week and ideally we'd have this done by next weekend
Yes how do I set up a meeting with them? Like who’s in charge of that team Also just finished #6 ayyy Thanks for the insight lolol	aye congrats lillian wang is event head she's probably more responsive over messenger
Ok I’ll text her	ok great ty
Ya	i'm going to sleep now lol
Go 2 sleep smh	u should too soon
Lolol	lmao wbu
The grind don’t stop Jk imma snooze	i agree but i gave up so i'm stopping the grind but the grind isnt actually stopping

Get hype Issok that’s what all day tomorrow is for Events team is having a meeting today at 5 if you wanna stop by? I’ll be at a meeting at 4 but can probably make it by 5 Maybe	Uhhhhh I don't want to go to the meeting if the stuff they're talking about isn't directly pertinent to baker
So what to say to her	i'll text her  here's the itemized spreadsheet for idea factory idk how much you can get done before our wednesday meeting but if you can have smth to talk about on wednesday that would be great Yo Did u leaveyet
No why	Omg I have a huge favor to ask of u My replacement credit card just came today But 8 literally left this morning So jianna has my new credit card If u don't mind could u bring it back for me

Shouldn’t you do it for 2 weeks?	yeah i technically should yeah will you also quarantine for 2 weeks you'll be interacting with your parents right
Nah lol I probs won’t Or at least I’ll try to take regular precautions	Hmm OK I feel like at least a little bit might be good because you're also traveling by driving too
Do you wanna go on a walk later today/ I can give you your card While social distancing Ofc	haha after i took that walk last week with my mom she thought she sick so i haven't been able to step foot outside the house in a while she thought she got sick* which was paranoia
Oh fuck Is she okay?	lmao she wasn't it was just a little chilly outside
Lmaoo	and my dad is so paranoid too lmao
I can just drop it off at some point then I mean yea it’s scary times	aha yeah if you're around that would be great
Like honestly it’s expected Kk sounds good Are you still quarantined to your room	:pp i don't even need it since i'm not buying anything atm nah i'm just quarantined in the house now lmao
Yea relatable  are you dying of boredom Did you hear of these novi children’s college acceptances lol We boutta be seeing srihari around A year ago today :,))	Oh shoot yes What the heck how did I not see your earlier messages That's so fucking wholesome Can't believe that was a year ago tho I feel exactly the same
We were at the sloan talk!! Yea holy crap Idk how that went by Crazy man	YEAH OMG I haven't been in Sloan since tho lmao
LOL Had a hass there but that’s about it I Remmeber they had such good food at that event lolol	Ik and then it was just downhill food from there

Hellooo it’s under your front mat	oooooh thank you bbb happy birth friendo
THANK UUUU	What's the celebration move
Well Got this thing in a few days called the 036 final So studying for that will be a banger 	Dude rip So rip Ive not really started tbh
exactly Same Big rip Boutta be a phat L	also i just have like no idea what we need t know because we've literally never taken an exam in this class
HAPPY BIRTHDAY JAMIEEEE Hope your day is as splendid as possible 	awwww thanks bb
^das u	ahaha it not me
It’s a bday cat So you!	it's a dandy saturday after finals so i'm feeling good rip you tho
Haha yesss Finally done w it	lesgetit
How you gonna celebrate Perhaps take a nice stroll outside	i'm just gonna make some food w mom tmrw and yes take a nice lil stroll
Ooh Bonding time My mom says she sees you guys walking often Then proceeds to chastise me for not walking w her	ahah i've realized that all the good food we want needs to be made by us now ahaha yes i feel guilty cuz i usually sit at my laptop all day and feel very sedentary
Lolol too scared to order right Yea rip	yeah my parents yanno
It’s like we’re home but not super free Yea rip	walk with your mother girl
Boringggg	ik i'd rather be hella busy but have to move around green is good for your eyes
Yea I feel you, it’s like all the bad parts of it without the good LOL is it actually	it's less bad sometimes it feels so surreal stepping outside cuz i'm just like wow the only thing confining me to my four walls is myself and this zoom meeting but like irrelevant am i right
Lolol yea If you think about it too much It messes w you Sometimes I walk around outside and I’m like Wait... I’m not supposed to be here lol Like this feels like high school or something But we freaking went to college Ya know	YEAH I KNOW every day feels like meta like i'm in the matrix or some shit
Exactly It’s like being home, but not truly being home But also thankful for the unexpected extra time w family I suppose	yeah i guess if u think about it we'll never spend this long at home again
Yea which is scary and weird to realize Tbh leaving to college I thought we’d never be home for longer than a few weeks ever again	ahah i wasn't really thinking when i went to college eitehr way it's crazy
Hello friend Show me these videos You were telling Saranya about From the good old days	 Haha heres the highlights
HAHAHAHHAA HAHAHAHAHAH WHAT ARE THESE	YOU
LMAOOO PLS SEND ME MORE	OK WILL FIND
People reacted very strongly to the video LOL	LOL wait wdym
Like I showed everyone And they’re in disbelief	OMG HABA U used to talk in an Indian accent all the time
BRO WHY DID I DO THAT IT WAS SO BAD	HELLA FUNNY
Who tf did I think I was That’s so embarrassing fml Bruh these sci oly pics Who tf designed our shirt It’s the ugliest possible thing	WAIT YEAH THE V NECK
With the ugliest possible aspects BRO V NECK	dude I literally can't
whcih can be nice but also not if you like the original room and want to just move in and be happy	hmm ok
but in maseeh you get to keep your room if you like it and are guaranteed to have it and you can still like try to switch floors or rooms if you choose like any other dorm	ok that's good
i tink it's mostly because they don't have as much of a difference ebtween floors compared to like BC	oh right cuz bc is very culture-y
we should like make an offering to the dorm gods to say thank you maybe a cow or something like a stuffed one to clarify not the live kind	W1-6/052                 333   SLEEPSTD W/OBATH   CAMPUS RESIDENCE oh agree 333 square feet looks big compared to the rest
wait does that mean it's a quad instead of a double	oh wait really...? there's only 5% quads tho ther'es no way
hmm ok hopefully it's not i feel like it's either a small quad or a big double	i'm looking for a floor plan rn
cause that seems pretty high compared to other sq feet?	Maseeh Hall is home to roughly 480 residents. We have 77 singles, 158 doubles, 15 triples, and 13 quads in the building for a total capacity of 490 residents. there's no way we got one of the 15 triples or 13 quads right
i wish i could download and sort the data to figure it out lmao	holy shit there's only 25 rooms with over 300 square feet i just counted
yeah... i was gonna say i don't see many above 300	roommates are supposed to come out tmrw i ranked quad like dead last tho u and i both did
ya i would assume they'd put us in a lower ranked dorm w a double instead of maseeh w a quad	interesting maybe they just really wanted us in maseeh lmfao milo cress is next door to us the floors are really spread out for the kids in maseeh there's kids on every floor
ok i also think during orientation we could try to leave the qua and get a double but stay within maseeh maybe?	yeah we'll try
like i know leaving a double or quad is a thing cause have 2x roomates	holy fucking hell
and less than 1.5x sq feet	it's a quad
is really suboptimal	check your email
... i guess we just try to switch during FYRE or whatever i don't even really get how the process of room switching works cause i was hoping to not but i'm confused i guess there were no doubles anywhere so this was what we got or just that 50% of freshman get quads or something i also don't get why there are literally triples that are bigger	ok but like nobody wants to switch into a quad that's the thing
i don't think we have to directly switch with people i think it's more like if someone swtiches out of maseeh into a different dorm then we can take their room	oh hopefully
and then if different people switchi into maseeh they would take the quad if they wanted or whatever but also apparently building switching is before room switching so i really don't know i guess that was a risk of maseeh	yeahhh guess we can only get so lucky
ya but like is a quad in maseeh better than a double in other dorms idk i guess it's better than no dorm in the top 3 choices or whatever  but this person like one of their only maseeh cons is the quad sizes	oh the quads are unusually small?
idk how they compare to other dorms' quads but the quads are defintely small like maseeh is known for big rooms but if you have a quad that doesn't apply	if u have a quad does that apply anywhere tho simmons doesn't do fyre tho right
that's probably true idk about simmons i'm also trying to find a picture or video of a maseeh quad anywhere on the internet but i can't	 join the groupme
ok i did lmao i found that ten seconds ago	aye nice
"Hey guys!
My name is Jianna Liu and I’m from the Bay Area in California. I am a hopeful aerospace engineering major and am still shaking from yesterday’s news.
Some fun facts about me are that I love reading (especially on Audible, not sponsored but wish I was), playing piano and tennis, dancing, baking (please try my vegan cupcakes you WON’T be disappointed), and wasting my time on Youtube. I am also a boba fanatic, but honestly what else can you expect from someone who lives in the Bay Area? My favorite movies are probably Hannah Montana and the Sound of Music.
I love listening to indie and pop and am so excited to * be in Boston for the next four years;)
I am so happy for all of you and hope we can meet soon!! hey everyone! my name is Claire Dong and i’m from the bay area, california!
some facts about me:
-intended major: course 6-3 (computer science) or 15-2 (business analytics)
-i’m interested in entrepreneurship
-i do cross country, soccer, track, and student govt!
-favorite tv shows: suits, himym
-favorite artists: chance the rapper, childish gambino, ajr
-i love photography and am always looking to go on photoshoots! check out clairedong.com for my pics lol
-i’m a huge foodie, and i can’t wait to explore Boston’s food scene
-i plan on bringing my ukulele to mit if anyone wants to jam w me!!
-follow me on instagram @clairedongg
lmk if we have anything in common and hmu if we’d vibe as friends or potential roommates! im excited to embark on our college journey together this fall :) those were the roomate people's intro posts"	LOL dang u did your work
nah if you go to members on fb and ctrl f and click it gives you the people's posts in the group so it took like 30 seconds i have not much talent otherwise iw oudl've found a pciture of a maseeh quad by now smh should we like start a gc w them or not because hopefully we can move out within the first week	sure we can talk to them first
tbh they seem like perfectly cool peopl ei just hate the space issue and also like all 4 people coordinating	right
in terms of sleep times and stuff	i'm guessing they don't want a quad either so
like i'd love to just be friends iwth them	we shall see
i just really can't live with that many people gosh	ik same tbh ok i just sent two friend requests once they accept i can probably make a gc we can discuss
i did too  says 95%+ keep their rooms so i don't think we're likely to switch	and we're not guaranteed to keep our original if we enter the lottery? i mean
no i think you're guarenteed to stay in maseeh	it might not be so bad oh but we'll have to move if we enter the lottery no matter what?
actually wait	is that what it means
ya i guess we're not guaranteed to get back to the quad which would mean we could be split up if there are only single spots left in triples and quads or something	right which is like hmm
wait someone said i got a double but i might want a triple or a quad so maybe there is hope?	WELL COME ON IN
at least the room is like close to the bathrooms and elevator? kind of conventinent or just loud and annoying when people come in in the middle of the night also where are the common rooms on the floor plans i think the X is just a space where you can't like keep anything not a sink or antyhing just like not a living space fyi	yeah true right there wer're like right there yeah that's what i thought too
also idk what to say in that group of roomates like hi none of us want a quad probably at least we have a good view tho? maybe it'll work out let's pray? ok more stats say that lots of people try to rex into maseeh and people don't erally rex out so i feel like it's only worth leaving the quad and doing the room assignment lottery if they say it's likely you can keep your pair or if the quad is so small anything is better	lmao ikr it's not i mean is it isn't it facing the front of the building like the student center okay we can ask when we get there right i mean duh they're excited tho so that's a nice sentiment
lowkey with bunk beds if we maybe move the desks into an interesting configuration maybe it won't be so ba and from their bios	yeah
it at least seems like they did a good job w pairings	it could be nice
like they're interested in rap and tennis and cs and stuff	chlidish gambino
and we're near the common room and bathroom and elevator which could be super convenient	yeah i like the optimism
ya i think it's worth trying to become friends over this month cause also if we all click and maybe can like ask them about living habits it'll be ok?	aight down
wait i thought you weren't doing an fpop mindy is doing flp and this girl maggie zhang who i met and is the nicest ever you should become friends with her	LOL yeah i wasn't gonna kind of like just wanted to in the end and wasn't sure if it was helpful or not but everyone seems pretty cool from the gc so far and it's supposed to make some nice connections so good
yeah i guess i just want to see the room but i suppose the best move is to accept it and try to make the best of it	yeah i guess i just need this time to absorb ok i'm honestly going to be fine either way it's just a matter of possibility of higher preference at this point
ya like maybe worth trying just for kicks but i feel like i'd be fine w not getting it i think end of the day maseeh is key	yeah i mean i just wanted the maseeh walking distance guarantee right
also the stupid maseeh tour video has a triple double single and. no. quad. shown what is that	ONLY 13 QUADS YAYYYY
ok to be fair i was thinking about it and 5% quads actually translates to like a solid chance cause they mean by room	Ah
but that means like 52 people in quads	Ah
and then another 36 in triples	Ahh
divided by freshman	So Thats
which is only a small part of the domr	Indeed
so it's actually not not particualry unlucky	A numerous amount
maybe something we should've forseen	OK but this guy from my school
i also hope their clean	Alsk got into maseeh
cause in the video	And he's in a double
if people keep stuff everywhere	And I dislike this guy Furthermore
i feel like the room looks so much smaller	So that makes it the worst probablh Yeah The spaciousness feeling is key
the whole period of not knowing exact details is so frustrating like even now at least we have it but then could maybe get reassigned and i jsut want things finalized	Oh could we?
so they can appear as fully formed unchangeable facts in my mind well i'm saying if we lottery	Right right Og Yeah That too
with a very small percent but the fact that there's some chance makes me think like hmm maybe	You won't have that peace of mind
exactly	Yeah I know what u mean
wait i just realized I think they will come in 2 bunked beds, but you can unbunk and have 4 beds. Also depends on the room you are in. I was in a corner quad x036 and it was a weird shaped room, so a bit cramped. If you're near the lounge, you'll have plenty of room. we're near the lounge idk if you got that when you sent the screen shot earlier i only like parsed the part about bed arrangements but i just went back and realized this is promising?	Hmm ok Wouldnt bunking them save more space tho
idk i guess they didn't bunk also can i just say i was like coming to terms with things and happy and then i looked closer at the floor plan the two rooms next to us are each 260 and one is a double and one is a triple so there's a quad with 320 and next door a double w 260 why couldn't they just make two triples like that makes no sense we have double the people and the same amount of space...	Damn So they gave somebody a 260 double
"apparently that's a common double size? like mostly doubles and triples can be that size if they're small triples or triples are the size of our room normally but i'm guessing freshman got the smaller doubles but who even knows JK
they gave is to a freshman so we just have bad luck also singles are literally half the size of our room like exactly half but you know what instead of being salty i will be happy at the opportunity to have a bunch of built in friends plus life experience i guess i just hope the room can be a study space except we're all mostly cs people so probably that isn't even a worry so you know what i'll go back to being happy about maseeh"	Lmaooo Glad u reasoned it out Yeah automatic pset buddies What course 6 stuff r u taking first sem I have work tmew so this was a bad idea but I stayed up to re firehose everything after further analysis Ok I failed I forgot to put a hass in one of my semesters Which is really unfortunate
Hahha I think I’m gonna take 6.009 and 6.03; 4	6.004? Computation?
6.034	Oh How r u fitting in like Discrete Physics 2 Or are u testing out Diff eq I am gonna retake too
Then I wanna take 6.042 and a humanities Well you can move three GIRs as PNR to later terms so that’s where I’ll take chem bio physics I’m trying to ASE out of Multi and then I have to take the CS one Technically if I duck up the Multi ASE I’d have to take it this term What are you ASEing?	Bio and introcs I was thinking of doing 6-2 Oh you're 6-14 so it's different right So that's why I need diff eq and physics Cux u need it for circuits and signals and stuff I was saving chem as well What's 6.034 btw I wanted to save physics 2 honestly but the problem is I want to figure out if I like ee this year so I'm trying to take signals this spring But that requires physics And diff eq Which is just unfortunate
Wait no Not 6-14 I’m 6-3 with a minor in 1; 14 Cause 6-14 is 50-50 cs and Econ classes and I want to take more cs classes I didn’t know diff eq was a requirement for 6-2 But I don’t think it is for 6-3? And I don’t need physics chem bio for anything So I figure they’ll be a buffer later and I’ll shove as many (presumably hard) cs classes first term as I can This is 6-3s thing 6.034 is AI	Lmao I had no idea 6.034 had no pre reqs Except 6.0001 Yeah 6-3 doesn't need diff eq Or physics immediately I'm tryna minor in business So idk if 6-2 is good What the fuck is this 6.0X requirement tho It's just like Unfortunate U need a humanities every semester tho I thought I would try to do some hard classes first semester too but the thing is I'm worried that even tho there aren't any official prereqs I should have the base knowledge And also the possible redundancy of taking a lower level class after I've already taken the one that supposedly comes after
Yeah idk I feel like they structure their prereqs so that you’d be okay taking anything you’re allowed to And I also feel like in general there won’t be too much repetition But that’s prob a valid worry Idk what’s better w 15	OK now I'm not sure Cuz I was just gonna kind of sweep up the ladder
But if you’re interested in 6-2 I’m sure it’s fine	But u make s good point about
Tho in real life you maybe wouldn’t use the EE stuff as an entrepreneur But if you’re interested in it why not	Idk if I am tho So that's the problem I think it could be useful
Well I just wanna take the hardest possible classes while there’s no grade tbh	That also have no prereqs lmao
Ya exactly	Yeah I see u What ci-h u doing first sem I'm gonna think about my schedule hmm
Ok I’m not positive cause it’s hard finding something to fit in So I might take a suboptimal humanities course to take all the cs classes (Suboptimal not meaning like something I don’t like but just maybe not my first choice)	(RHETORIC) I haven't picked the other hass I want for spring yet So like Presumably 6.00Xs are easier than the other stuff right OK that's probably true Considering they're foundational stuff :p everything is just Idk
Ya but I think 6.004 is hard From what I’ve heard	Oh goodie
And 6.006 requires 6.009 as a coreq	?
So also needs a knowledge base	Isn't it discrete I thought it was discrete Not programming
Intro to algorithms ?	I'll check Yeah u just need discrete and introca Says or Why do they have all those intro eecas 6.0Xs if they aren't pre reqs to anything
Dude I really have no clue How tf their stuff works Hopefully like The advisor knows what’s going on Except if the advisor is from some random department Will they?	They should Yeah I think taking discrete is important ok so here's what i've learned 6.02, 6.004, 6.033, and 6.046 are the hardest cs requirements and 6.046 is the hardest followed by .033 but both have a few prereqs
Hmm that’s promising? I don’t think taking like the very hardest cs requirements first terms is possible pre req wise nor advisable transition wise	Yeah after I sent u that I spent like another 3 hours figrig it ot And I think I have grasped the concept essetially Of what I'll be taking
Wait so what have u decided Oh wait you still have to keep first term the same Cause you need the eecs prereq Regardless of the research right Like physics diff eq humanities and discrete? But then you figured out later terms?	So I figured That I should probably check if I like ee before I take diff eq
That sounds logical So what are you taking instead?	So I'm gonna do ci-h, 6.042, 6.02, and 6.004 Then next semester I'm going to take 6.006, 6.009, 8.02, hass, and 6.034 I was thinking about taking .009 instead of .02 but then realized there's no point because I'd die in .031 & .033 I was going t save it for sophomore year One at a time Then .046 junior year ig It could change in like Two seconds tho Because m brain is too fried to think anymore
You’re gonna take 5 second term? Ok wait I think I’m taking 6.006 and 8.2 second term So that’s fun And we’re both taking 6.042 obviosuly So someone to relate to over struggles! And then probably 6.01 So kind of a lot of the same classes except in different riders Orders	Still doing 009 and ai first semester Yeah nbb I was thinking of taking 5 eah Tbh it's just to test out if I can do it and be ok But if it doesn't work I'll just drop 034 or physics
Ya I feel like five is manageable potentially just depending on the difficulty and time required for all of them But since dropping is easy I guess why not	Yeah idrk
Ok I have a question For hack mit did you say you want to be put in a random team or that you’d find people sometime before yourself Also can I just say the categories for the tracks are very vague and that bothers me Also they finally sent it after forever cause apparently they extended it by a week Which I guess happens w student run things But at least it came lol	Oh okay good Uh I think I said find by myself I'm not planning on making anything tbh I was just gonna go and learn So I put fintech first and then like health and smth else
Ok cool I talked to a bunch of people today Cause there was a barbecue for people in Massachusetts And everyone said basically they’re going for the free stuff and to learn And have no particular plans to do a project at all lol	Lop OK great same thing then
Wait	Oh was it like a farewell thing
Have you heard of a tennis  layer Named Derek From Michigan But like a long time ago	Last name?
Like moved to massachusetts Shen I think Apparently he’s like really really good And used to live in Ann Arbor and moved	No clue lol
But I thought you might know anyway from whenever Oh nvm then lol Idk how many really good Michigan tennis players there are	Is he like beyond my time
I suppose Michigan is good at sports in general No our grade	Oh wow no
But he moved to Massachusetts before high school I guess and like was saying hes ranked nationally or soemthing But Idk about the middle school tennis scene lol	Smh he's too good for me to have heard of
Well he lives like directly below us so Maybe you’ll see him in maseeh and recognize him from a thingy or something that’d be wild Michiganders unite!	Oh shoot lol Would indeed be wild Did u know All 4 novi mit kids Are in maseeh
Surprisingly yes Only because I saw their names But that’s pretty lit	Oh well we don't really like ajay So That's a whole problem Did u sign up for ases yet
ya got confirmation for the cs one but not for the general form	OK me too hey advising is open btw
ya i got an email from my advisor person so i realized before the post about advising on fb who did you get? are you in a seminar or just traditional?	James paradis Traditional I knew I was going to get traditional though Because they emailed me before when they told me I didn't get into an advising sen
oh right he seems cool science and media	Wbu Lol competitive studies and media
Kai von Fintel	Comparitive
he's a linguistics professor	Traditional?
no seminar	Oh also interesting What sem is it
24.A03 That's Just Semantics: The Search for Meaning information theory, cryptography, linguistics, logic, psychology, anthropology, computer science, philosophy, and literature those are like the mixture of topics	Oh yeah I did look at that one
i think it was my second choice maybe so it should be cool	It sounds very interesting Damn Wonder if any seminars will open up during orientation Try to squeeze my way into one if possible
tbh they might if people get like their fourth choice and decided they don't want it but maybe it was one of ur top choices and you can just borrow their spot permanently	Mm okay lmao
also i was curious since you're like off campus for fpop do you still like come to campus and just leave immediately or will you be around for a while	I'm staying there 20th leaving 21st morning Also what time r u going to arrive Because low-key want to take a look at the dorm and pick a bed before leaving Did u get an email about move in time Mine says 2pm for some reason
mine says 12-2	What the SHIT
maybe they all scheduled us to arrive around the same time or something?	Damn
wdym before leaving tho	I put On my orientation form That my flight lands at like 7 tho So I don't really see How this is convenient for me
wait 7 am	I could theoretically Just go right I emailed them about it last night Like before fpop I want to kind of claim an area In the room
can't you just do that in the night of the 20th or like afternoon kinda depends on when the other people are coming too i wanted to go early in the morning too cause it's more convenient for my parents	Yeah I mean it doesn't matter when we pick beds or whatever I'm assuming just whoever gets there gets therw
but i assumed they put us all at the same time but if they didn't then what's the point	But since my flight is so early I'll be on campus way earlier And I don't want to carry ny stuff around if I can move in Yeah I'm not really sure
wait but how much stuff are you bringing are your parents coming during orientation or are you bringing all of your stuff for fpop	My parents are bringing like also everything I'm bringing all my clothes and bed stuff
oh gotcha hmm ok i might email them too cause it's way easier for my parents if i go early cause they have work but also we're dropping off helen potentially cause she's staying with us the night before	Small Helen?
which adds a layer of logistical complexity helen wang	Right Uh Texas Helen? OH
yeah to harvard	She's flying up early and staying with you Okay
she's flying the night before cause there were no flights	Yeah OK got ir
that didn't arrive late on tuesday we could also all potentially get lunch or something idk what's happening	Good idea
also how early do you have to leave to get here at 7 am i just realized i was thinking red eye but michigan is not that far	Well does she have to move in afternoon
jesus christ	What's red eye
like middle of the night like you leave at midnight but get there in the morning	My flight is 5:45am So u know my parents will be awaking me at 330am I went to bed at 4 last night so I feel like I night as well just stay up
wait it's only a 1 hour flight damn i was thinking like 3 so i thought you were out here going to the airport at 2 am	It's like 545 to 732 specifically
not that 3:30 is that much better	U knkw Michigan is not that far rifht It's a 12-14 hour drive
ok but on a map it feels like it would be far away like in my head there are all these states like ohio and shit between us and ohio feels kind of far away	Uhh Ohio is like Siuth of us
wait what in my head things are different	Uhhhh bro
wait so then ur ubering with all your shit that's very painful	My partner's r driving through Canada to make it a little faster
they'll definitely let you check in early if you're just siting there	Yeah I hope so
your partner? also maybe i should email them idk we'll see	I want to uber because taking the subway sounds cumbersome Parents Sorry
OH but they're coming a week later right?	Yes
i guess i'm dumb cause you also drove to new york so i should've known it's not that bad	Lol Yes We did
ok wait i just realized so helen's checkin is at 11 but ideally i'd be here earlier but if helen comes with us the three of us can just like hangout or get brunch or lunch or something after checking in until helen has to go potentially like that could be a nice amount of time to do it that doesn't invovle traveling to another campus for anyone	Lol works for me I want to hermit so bad on the 20th But I feel like I shouldn't But I also feel like not even everybody will be there all day So What's the ooint
i don't think you have to go around that much on the 20th i mean like meeting people is good but also outside of ur FPOP if u do the like hi what's ur name thing and then don't see someone for a week unless it's an actual conversation, do u even remember them i feel like i want to spend a decent amount of time putting some of my shit away in my room the first day especially since there's a 95% chance we;'re staying in it also i think sometime in the afternoon my mom and i might go to like some store like target or whatever to get a couple of things that i don't want to get until we see the room so if there are anythings that you can't bring but need to buy (like toiletries or food or whatever else) ur welcome to come if we go	Makes sense Aight I'm finna down Wonder if those guys are bringing a fridge Cuz my parents were gonna just bring it if they could because I don't think we'll move And on the off chance we did I'd make u help me carry it So it all works out
i don't think they are cause jianna said she's flying and cindy shipped her bedding to my house which means she's also probably flying i was gonna potentially bring one but it's really small and kinda old so if ur parents are driving that works out better also i just confirmed w helen that she's down to come early so we can all meet up so i guess i'll email them although tbh probably doesn't matter	Oh shoot I thought her name was Claire for some reason
fuck it is	Just like in my head I thought that Holy
i'm literally looking at her name cause she messaged me about the thing arriving	Oh jesus Had me worried rhere
but then typed a completely different anme idk why	Yeah we'll see if it can fit
other than mental instability	Right now the pile in my living room is looking quite laege Large
dude kinda same and the amount of storage seems less than like simons cause there's no chest thingy that's big only a small one that goes under the desk	Oh what Wait what storage
but hopefully the closet is a little bigger to compensate	Oh like okay I got it
also did you just email residence@mit.edu?	Yeah
like responding to the email ok cool	Also let me pose a quick idea I didn't reply I sent a new email So My family friend who just graduated from school told me that this is a good idea for making small rooms seem bigger Put the two beds into a corner then loft them slightly and put the dresser underneath Then arrange desks however
wait wdym loft them slightly also we don't have a dresser unless you mean the big closet thing but isn't that too tall dresser is normally like the smaller drawer thing but there isn't one also when you say into a corner do you mean like next to each other side by side? also which meal plan did u choose? also which ases are you taking? also which discovery thing are you doing for the 9 credits	Oh shat You're right
sorry i just realized i had a lot of little things that i've like done that i'm not sure i've done correctly	Yeah like perpendicular To each othwr
so rapid fire seems like the best way to address them	260 Intro Cs and bio U? 8m going to try to take a business class See if they'll approve it
wait business as a fifth class? instead of discovery? i have to take multi cause it was a class at my school not a college credit and then cs	I mean there already are some course 15 discovery business classes
and i did the 190 thing OHHH gotcha	But I might try to take a different o e We'll kind of just see R u going to fill your extra 6 units Oh really I did more my mom said the price difference was small for the number of meals difference So I'm just going to eat there a lot Yeah sucks u probably learned more in multi than i did
yeah the price is probably better but from what i've heard there's a ton of free food around and people have too many plus i'm not a big breakfast person so i wouldn't really go in the morning anyways i mean it's nice cause at least you don't even have to bother asa-ing out you can just be done with it i have to like go back and try to remember calculus which is really taxing my brain man	Oh loll Yeah thank the transfer credit lords
this is inequality at it's finest!	Ehe ok dude wtf why is professor lander such a homie not only is this dude like a key founder of the human genome project he submitted a brief to the supreme court in a gene patenting case that was like the basis for their unanimous decision that no genes cannot be patented like wtf bro why is he such a homie
Dude he’s so cool Everyone I know says if ur taking bio take it in the right term to be in his class It’s wild cause I like knew who he was as a famous geneticist before knowing he was a professor But yes SUCH a homie Also did you ever hear back from the residential people	Yeah they were vague but I think I'm good
Wait wdym they were vague?	"""you can come to campus as soon as u arrive"" Even though I was asking about moving in to maseeh"
hmm ok i haven't got a response yet but i sent the email a bit later than you and also i'm guessing they have a lot of emails which are probably more relevant if people have actual move-in issues but since they seem very vague and weren't like we'll put you on a different list or whatever i think i'm just gonna go cause i doubt if i'm there w a suitcase they're gonna be like wait 3 hours and come back..	Yeah I think I'll be fine
I met victor Big moment I won’t even lie	Cool guy?
Oh very He’s kinda quiet tho I don’t know how to approach And become best friends you know	He's like that No can do He recently got braces
What does that have to do with anything Is he gonna bits me if I come to close	I just wanted to tell u
Also are you coming back	I mean Swim test
How are you texting	Still got half an hour
If you’re swimming Liar	I brought my phone onto the pool deck Shut up
Oh that’s low key smart Your parents are doing lots of things My frickin orientation leader wants us to meet at 5:15 tho so idk if you’ll even get back before I go What a catastrophe	Yeah what r they doing
Putting all the stuff and things away Have you been to the room since you got back st all	I let my parents in yeah It's a mess
I mean it’s getting there I feel like you can have it done by tonight	That's good Because I want my bed
Your bed is done It’s just all the other things that are left I think	Oh wow did they end up lofting it more
Yeah They were moving it up and down but from the look of it they ended a bit higher than it was Like maybe at the highest possible? Yo are you coming back soon Don’t forget to lock room when you get phone	Hey Can u Check if my keys and Id are up therr Be cause I can't get up without it and I don't think I took it with me on accident
Yeah they’re on your desk U need me to bring it down?	It's okay I hitched a ride
Also The other two people drink Just FYI Claire has two little bottles under the bed Like 2 ounces	And her parents know?
No she was showing friend Rachel And jianna was talking about being drunk once Telling some story	So does this have anything to do with us We should make it clear that like No drinking in here And partying In here
I mean I think that’s already clear She told her dad not to throw his beer out in here	Oh
In case they thought it was ours So she seems paranoid	Okay that makes sense
I think they’ll just go to frats and stuf	She's scared of being found out?
Which is whatever	Wonder if her parents are like Strict
Her parents are cool w it tho	Oh
Her dad offered her a sip of beer When he walked in with it	I see
And Jianna’s dad was like Noooo She’s not 21	Their side of the room is looking
I mean I don’t think they’re cool w her drinking alone	A lil hectic
But st home and tuff	If I'm being honest Oh
Also indeed	I see So like not here
Yo My prents dropped off two brownies If you want one Just know that it’s waiting for you back in maseeh Cause I’m not eating both	Bro Lit
Also i got a cow Icymi	What the fuck does that mean

From middle school math comp Lmao But fitting for mit I feel	Cute
Yo you want a pancake ??	Nope OK si There was definitely Alcohol yesterday At both said parties

I know older people who were ducked up	Where they don't remember anything today
But I didn’t know there were drinks for first years Are you sure	One of them remembers Claire too Yes one of my friends took five shots and was ou T

oh shoot jianna and claire went to eat at stud cause they were hungry and something about work flow? and then I went to stud 5 cause I like working here also is there any chance you can send me like one of your things from your latex for 5 (like not with any coloring I literally just need a blank one) because I've been trying to make this simultaneously look like the graph and have a way for me to assign colors to node and it does one or the other but not both and i've spent way too long on this shit (things being like the part of the code that makes the graph not anything else) cause I tried like a loop and then that was using polar and i tried fucking rectangular which was a fucking mess and i can't get colors on the polar and i can't get proper locations on rectangular cause then i'm hand coding the shit	I can send u saakeths But u should probably add him as a collab Then
ok I will	"\begin{tikzpicture}[thick, scale=2]

idk just anyone who's male and living and speaks to you	is all of a sudden
have you not noticed that?	a suitable suitor?
well yes	lmao this is all very
you've never expressed like	low standard
preference so until you do it's just like everyone also are you going to the poker thingy\ tomorrow	so if i express preference will u stop attacking me i'll come after startlabs yeah
yes of course then i'll only pick people within preference also the thing you sent i'm still confused where you change the color this is the same problem i had before where it's like all one color but for the shit you have to make them different and that's what i could never fucking get wait i think i know how to fix lemme try please work wait no still confused rn it's in a for each loop but they need to be individually colored oh fucking hell i'm blind this whole time i've been trying to color not label i just didn't even look you did labeled numbers instead of physical coloring? hmm also it's pouring outside and i have nothing and i don't know what to do cause it's not gonna stop :(	wait there's places to color on the top
yo i have a question for 3 c the inductive step when you were phrasing it where did you say you were splitting it	i think i just said by 3b oh uhhh like the odd0length shit
oh i meant 4 yeah	i just wrote an example x1 to xi to xi to x1 then xi to xi and x1 to x1 without the shit in between
uh what the fuck does that mean	like i said there exists some closed walk such that there's a repeated node right
no i get what you said the phrasing is just janky you know what it's ok	wait i did proof by contradiction
i'll leave my janky phrasing	with WOP
Yo Wait nvm idk if you’re on your phone still	I win
Oh wait you are I tried running it But I got memory errors On like a couple tests	What the fuck is a memory error
Did that happen to you?	Also I win
Oh lol Got it Yes you win	Nope Yeah
Also idk I guess just for bigger tests Maybe it’s the data structure I’m using Idk how to debug A fucking memory error	You're only calling solve linear once right
Yeah	How r u creating the equation s
But the memory error happens In solve linear Like solve linear be the problem	So do u have to change solve linear
I mean presumably I just don’t know what to change lol	Hmm
Also confusing cause When I ran tests on computer Everything worked But it’s not working on the server	That's weird Maybe the way you're allocating space Is not efficient?
I mean it’s just a bunch of dictionaries and sets? I didn’t really put that much thought into it	R u looping and saving to them more than u need to? I really have no clue what a memory error is
It just means The program ran out of memory Which is allocated based on OS / server it’s being fun on “Program creates too many objects”	Maybe the server is running too many tests rn Oh Lol Hmm Do u have a lot of temps
No?	They said in the instructions to directly modify shit when calling functions Or Solve linear at least
Hmm really? Ok I guess I’ll try	Yeah like I just removed variables from existing dicts or sets
Oh ok hmm Yo text me when you’re done w tennis	I'm walking back now
Sometimes I wish we had a double k supposing that the rest of this conversation is confidential i don't think claire likes me very much which doesn't particularly bother me in fact in many moments i would say it brings me satisfaction but we're also a month in so i'm not sure how this is gonna play out over the course of a year	Not a lot of options though
i mean i'm fine with it i just feel like having tension will be ~suboptimal~ and is also inevitable just like more of a fun fact let me share than a oh no have to fix	Oh Well U don't like her very Much either right Unavoidable things
no i like her just find except when she says things to me because she doesn't like me and then i respond accordingly but outside of that i'm rather neutral to be fair i don't think she likes any of us all that much given that she called us uninteresting and said she wanted new friends	Rude without realizing ig Doesnt matter ig She doesn't need to be tight w us
i know but today she was calling her friend got off the phone then i started calling mine and she's like can you go outside i'm trying to focus ... i was like no then she was like jamie and jianna call a lot too let's make a rule that no one calls in here and i was like... also no that's so inconvenient and i think she also just finds me really annoying which i can't fault her but when she's directly like you're so fucking annoying i really have to bite my tongue to not scream fuck off at her and she did it twice today and the second time i kind of did tell her to fuck off in a someone veiled way but with some cursing so hopefully she got the message because i really couldn't give two shits about what she thinks and she's commenting on my interactions with other people which is none of her fucking business sorry i'm just frustrated and i can't fucking vent any fucking where and i also can't vent about jianna being drunk and running over my foot which fucking hurt cause like if i tell say my parents they're gonna be like yikesd by the drunkness of said roommates and i don't need to add that kind of stress to their life	She's probably never had to live with this many other people before And she's going to have to learn to be More tolerant We don't have a lot of stuff to work with here Just gotta make it work
yes but i have limits to what i put up with and i don't know these people well enough to confront them like you know how when you're close with people	Don't have to know them well to
you can raise issues cause you're confident things will work out cause you care enough about the relationship to not let minor disagreement be a thing but i feel like when i don't know someone that well then i can't like be uncensored	The point isn't to be uncensored It's to set your limits Without coming off as antagonistic
i can't	Which I feel that
not be antagonistic	May be difficult Yeah Lol
cause she's pissing me off in like deeply irritating ways like jianna running over my foot was not a big deal i just needed to not be around drunk her so i went to other room and everything is fine very surface level annoyance and like temporary foot pain claire making mean comments is not surface level	It's because u guys always dig your heels in deeper when u disagree Like You know you guys are never going to convince each other of your points right Why argue It doesn't matter Just brush it off what she thinks is of no value to u But I think That's why
yes but she's saying it	She started making comments
in a public sphere which affects how i interact with others so therefore it's my concern	Wdym
like when she says you're so annoying while i'm talking to ben and tai and jianna that makes me feel like shit in front of a bunch of people so i can't just ignore it	I don't think that They think that just because Claire says youre annoying That u are Because if anything It just makes her look bad
no but it's embarrassing and like idk it's just not a thing it's like if you were in front of kevin and david and i come up and i'm like hey you got a 50 on your physics test you're so dumb like that's not a thing you say in front of other people while pointing out a perceived negative quality or whatever and also like i don't like bullies or people who make other people feel like shit and i won't just not say anything cause she'll keep doing it i feel obligated to push back so she learns to not say those things or at least not say them to me i'm not particularly invested in her personal development just as it affects me or the people i care about	OK but when u respond similarly doesn't it just make things worse Like think about it
no cause you can't let people walk all over you if you push back sometimes they learn to shut up	I'm not saying to let her say the thing but
because they realize they don;'t like how it feels when they get called out what do i do to not let her say the thing other than respond i either respond or i don't and if i don't then she keeps doing it like i didn't respond the first time today when we were in the other room but then she did it again and at that point it's like what the fuck do i do just like when i was face timing and she's like hey leave i can't just be like sure no problem cause it is a problem and if you don't assert that you're just miserable right like the alternatives are be walked on or have tension	Well then don't let the tension bother u If you act like it's not worth your time She's going to feel silly
no i don't think she realizes enough to feel silly	Sometimes u don't have respond antagonistically too
then how do i respond like walk me through it coach i genuinely don't know i'm not even being sarcastic	Sometimes just making her sit in silence and realizes how shes being rude can work
she doesn't	Or responding in a joking manner that shows
realize there's a lack of self awareness that's painfully obvious in everything she does because she says she like people at mit suck so there's no eventual realization or change	well then what's the point of all this discussion the goal is just to handle it not make it change right so you can choose to limit your interaction with her or continue to feel bothered
how do i limit my interaction i wasn't even interacting with her we were having a conversation and she interjected while she was studying i literally was like aren't you studying? why are you commenting and she was like you guys are fucking loud so i said use your fucking airpods this is a fucking shared space and two of us want to be social and one person wants to study so you don't get to be all uppith	ok well first of all that sounds like not the proper way to respond for either of u really but like the point is that she can do whatever she wants and it doesn't matter if u think it's right or not because maybe in her mind you guys should go somewhere else to socialize but the point is
but	that it doesn't matter whether she should be fnding somewhere else to study
she brings vincent over all the fucking time	or u should be leaving
just like she facetime all the fucking time	i'm not saying she's not hypocritical i think it's just that now u guys have this kind of established tense relationshi her natural response is to be annoyed just limit the interaction man and try not to be passive aggressive
we don't have a tense relationship we're perfectly find probably more friendly cause we interact a lot more	that's what u may think though
than you do with her i mean i think i understand my relationship with her more than you? given that i'm a member of it it's just in certain moments when we disagree and then we go back to being fine every other time there are just specific issues about which we disagree often linked to liek	so then if it's fine why do u think she dislikes you
someone trying to study	claire doesn't seem like someone who wants to be friends with someone she doesn't like
i don't think she wants to be friends with any of us i mean we don't have tension relative to all the other relationships in the quad	ok then it's not a big deal then like the more you think about it
nevermind just finish your app	the more you'll be like
i don't want to waste your time	i have to think about how to behave and how to make her not be rude to me
i'm not doing that	but to be fair you guys really get going if you disagree because neither of you will like
i'm not changing how i behave for her	back down
and i'm not backing down that's not productive then you just internalize resentment	just be on a higher pedestal than her no point in arguing with someone who isn't going to change I'm going to the bathroom if I'm not back by the time u r
We’re in lounge What the fuck just happened	Still at bank Damn the whiplash I felt from reading these two posts in succession
Lmao dead	what should the base case have been on pset 3 2c just 1? that's sad
Lol Yeah	damn why
I don’t really remember off the top of my head And I’m walking But we can talk about it in class If you’d really like	okie
Instructions For coding things From companies Very strictly say Don’t get any help From any people	Can't enforce it anyways
Yeah but Cheating is cheating You also can’t enforce not being an adulterer Yet that’s the expectation in marriage (As you should know)	… Oh well
Moral apathy Is probably worse Than like repugnance Cause at least those people have taken a stance But go off	I wonder if hers told her not to get help Maybe she's under the presumption that
They all do That’s the point	She can ask for help
It’s a form of interview No I think she dgaf	At least she's not asking him to do it for her right
She was asking around A lot In philosophy And at a meal And to us Before she started And had a bug fix	I think u should just ignore it because there's nothing u can do about it but not participate
Well I’m not gonna say anything I just need someone to share in my smhing	Karma is karma
Well yes hats what a live technical interview is for Or like When you actually get the job	Yeah so
It’s just that there are real coding people	No point in smhing now
Who might not get a chance to interview Because of something slightly more against the rules than this And that’s be sad for them So even milder forms sort of sadden me It’s like when people get into college for stupid shit And it’s like whatever But it’s just a little uncomfortable	Effective altriusm Just change the system Make it foolproof
Misuse of effective altruism But like How do I change it by tomorrow Should be fine at like 10:52 ish Done 879	Okay I'll try to get there asap but I just got into dining what temp dry OK wait high-key there's a lot of regular black tea ones left and I like that too so u should sauce one of those You called squishmallow thief. You called squishmallow thief. i love you! i think there's something wrong with the way the data is loading i ran the same fucking code twice in row zero changes and look
:(	ok jk i'm kind of dumb but so is this problem
Is it working now	no lmao i just fixed one test case yay
wait was it F or any of the satisfiable cases post F	No b lmfao I'm not working on that rn anyways
can you please tell me what's wrong with my method like i genuinely have stared for so fuckin long and i don't understand like it just feels so right	ok so the mistake i fixed i think it was not intuitive but i'll explain when i get back
wait but my b was working	i just passed the last test case it wasn't just like a b thing
wait like all of them? you passed all of theM? ???	NO LMAO fuck no i meant my 6.004 lab lmao sorry i was excited that i got to go back i've been here for like 2 hours
oh i see how exciting i'm v happy for you bb (that's how you talk) (if you were wondering)	i use bb but i don't really use v
JAMIE IM SO CONFUSED :(	bro me the fuck too
i've been staring at this for so fuckin long i'm so fuckin sad	maybe u need a break don't u have any other work
yeah but i just took a break from 12:30 to 3 and i just like need this win man Are you back And or working on  .009	I'm back Idk if I'm gonna do .009 rn tho
Ugh Why Aren’t you don’t w .004 And like mostly done with .042	Yeah but I want to study for 6.042 Yeah I'm going to office hours later
Exactly So why work on it now Oh yeah Jeffrey asked me If we’re studying for .042 tomorrow Are we? And if so at what time When is the WBL thing	Perhaps not
Before that right	I have a hack meeting right before wbl And then a general meeting basically right after
Ah okay I’ll say no	I'm free from 4 to 7 if that helps But I also want to eat dinner so
Are you? Going to thanks Yhaxks	well jack said hack gets 4 spots to go to the thing so i might want to
Does no one else want to do Go	no there's like 6 people that soft wanted to go
Gotcha	we should just make the yale hoes come here tho
Why would they ever come here Kevin and David are in the same recitation Adorable We stan	For what class Idk we're cool
6.042 Yeah but it’s not easy to get here And here’s way more of them there So the obligation should be on us to go there if anything	My phone deadass stopped ringing cause I think it registered u as a spam caller
You’re def wrong but ok That’s not how it works If someone calls you multiple times Otherwise friends would get registered as spam all the time	My phone definitely stopped ringing tho
i think it's not successful blackmail cause jack don't really look bad in the email	if anything vikas dooes that's what i thought so i don't understand why he's being so uppity about it fuck columbia kids
you def got that word from me i use it so much	uppity?
uppity	false
but yeah he'd just look dumb	i know u and i understand that but regardless it's still bad publicity because he sounds like a good liear liar
no he rlly doesn't like the things he's saying	like he could very easily say
from someone reading the emial are clearly unreasonable he's gonna publish the email chain right	"it could be like what's it called the thing that draws people in catfishing for title s ""hackmit promises $4000 to student then refuses to give it to winners"" also other than u and i would all people think he's dumb i think so but idk"
ok wait pause i need a fun fact ’ve eaten an average of 1 to 2 chipotles per week for the last ten years! thoughts *I've ok ur true if he lies properly he could cause some shit but i'm sure jack will handle it	jack is actually so patient not just with him but like us in general how does he not want to fucking rip this guy's head off cuz i do and i wouldn't even feel bad about getting blood on my clothes
wait i need fun fact feedback	is this for the sbc website
also if he says something assholey he could look bad if the guy publishes probably just trying to cover his ass cause he knew this could happen also no	yeah ik that's foresight
SWE	smh swe ain't nobody got time for fun facts
? what's wrong w swe and what's wrong w my fun fact	"nothing's wrong with swe lmao it's just that ""ain't nobody got time for fun facts"" -jamie -jimmy"
ok well i don't really care	-jimothy
if people read it they told me gimme and now i'm givin	well 1-2 chipotle per week doesn't sound as extreme
well i just meant ten years	as something else chipotle related so how many is that over the course of 10 years
was like 500-1000? are you joining this frat or what's going on	i was looking up primal what is that
? idk back to the fun fact thign sir help! help!	what other ideas you got
none i got none ideas i'm married?	better uhhhhhhh i guess u could do chipotle
i could do something like generif I'm a die hard Broncos fan blah blah blha or something along those lines but i can't make it funny both due to char limit and that i don't want random people seeing my random shit so i don't know	i mean i don't thnk the chipotle thing is significantly funnier so u should just pick something u want
i wasn't saying the chipotle thing is funny chipotle was another example of something not funny	oh
because i'm not going for funny so why would i come up with something funny because this is something like an employer could see for example	okay so maybe you should go broncos
fun fact: i want a job - hire me!	that's relatable go broncos then an employer has something to talk to you about you know is there a way jack could release this information first instead of having vikas release it eh nvm
yeah an error correction notice lmao also can you think of anyone else i should add to guest list	r u good enough friends with thomas to add him?
i thought about that	you type so loud lmao
but i've never like messaged him	okay that's fair
which is perhaps indicative of the fact that like i'm not	he'll probably just be with jeffrey anyways
ya but jeffrey can't let him up	wait i was under the assumption that u could
nope just individual access i'm p sure	i mean yesterday vincent came up and nobody stopped him without guest access
well they don't check that much	yeah so
or claire added him	probably not a problem claire did
and didn't mention	but
did you add mindy and see young	it was like the immediate day before yeah
so no one? sad :(	you've probably added elizabeth
i just feel like i don't go back to maseeh w many people	what about some sbc hoes
well i don't go back with them,	but if u have something u want to work on w them it doesn't hurt
did you see that that was somewhat improvement cause i was bothered by her reapeating so i was right and you were wrong when she does not in fact really understand what's going on but then instead of telling her you're wrong i dialed it back pretty impressive right?	Lmao Yes I'm proud of u do u want to read my speech ANJALIE I WROTE IT ABOUT MASEEH
Lol sure	U were too late I put my laptop away I'm going to board soon
I responded in five minutes Jesus	It was funny U missed out
That’s decent turnaround time	Tragic Absolutely
I’ll read it tomorrow	Terrible
:O	Sad
Unless you don’t make it In which case	Lamentable
I love you	:o
I’ll miss you I won’t forget you	Why r u guys like this
I’m taking ur bed	On a scale of 1 to 10 How much
Thank you for being a good friend And wife	
Wait literally like 9.7	Aw shit
Like my parents are a 10	Aw shattt
It’s logarithmic Obviously but still Like there aren’t too many people I’d be more sad about	Aight fair enough
Plus I live with you so I’d think about it all the time And in half my classes And who would I take 8.02	Yeah it do be half
With it’d be a mess	Oh don't have expectations for 8.02 yet
I’m not tryna work on psets alone	What if I decide not to
Oh no I’ll be making you Well persuading you You won’t even know it’s happening	"Lmao Hmm Will consider So I think it’s safe to say that Maseeh Hall is objectively the best dorm on campus, but I know that a lot of you may choose not to live there because you’re worried about fitting in (it’s definitely no easy task). But have no fear! As a 5-week resident of Maseeh 6, I’ve taken on the honorable task of teaching you how to become a true Maseehdonian so you can transfer in next semester! 

There are 5 How Tos in becoming a Maseehdonian: 

1.	How to embody the spirit of convenience
a.	Here at Maseeh, you’ll live less than 10 minutes away from any single one of your classes, so make sure you wake up 5 minutes before class starts and still be late
b.	But! On the off chance that you make it to class on time, make sure you tell every single person you encounter for the rest of the morning about “how close Maseeh is”
c.	Here’s an example: “LOL I woke up 5 minutes before class today, but I live in MASEEH so I still made it.”
d.	Complain about walking to the Stud: “It’s so far it’s like over 50 feet away!”
2.	How to have proper bathroom etiquette
a.	Here at Maseeh, we have hall bathrooms, so the unfortunate part is that you’ll have to walk down an entire hallway to get to a private bathroom, because who wants to use the 3-person one? 
b.	But, think of it this way! You’ll get a free workout every time you go to the bathroom because the doors are so heavy! Now you don’t even have to take the 5-minute walk to get to the Z because arm day is every day!
3.	How to utilize the dining hall
a.	Don’t
b.	Go to McCormick
c.	But, if you’re brave enough, you can offer up the weak rebuttal that “it’s not that bad” and that we have “late night!”, which may consist of limp fries and leftover cupcakes
4.	How to fit into Maseeh culture
a.	Walk into the lounge
b.	Walk out
c.	In fact, turn off the lights
d.	Close the door to your room
e.	Never come out
5.	How to the live in a big room
a.	I wouldn’t know, I live in a quad, and you might get to live in one too! 
b.	You’ll get 330 square feet for 4 people instead of 270 square feet for 2 people! 
c.	And the exciting part is that you’ll have such a great time hauling furniture from one corner to another in effort to make everything fit, but you’ll never be able to! 
d.	Stare longingly into other people’s rooms when you leave your room every month

So, with this 5-step process you’re on your way to becoming a true Maseehdonian! It’ll take some time and practice (nobody is perfect at complaining about their nonexistent walk to class every day), but by next term I have faith that each and every one of you will be ready to move in! Once you get there, if you’d really like to go above and beyond, you can learn our singular tradition of pretending that playing Smash is a culture. Good luck and I’ll see you on Maseeh 6 next semester! here u go"
Wait I fucking love everything about that I’m actually dead Like I can’t articulate the best parts Cause I’m too amused by so many of these parts LMfao Odds are you send this inthe maseeh 6 email list	Holy shit Lmao glad u like it
Yo What time are you getting back Sir Cause I told Jeffrey tomorrow we’d work but like you have to be there cause why pset if you’re not around you feel?	i'll be back around 8am but i don't want to go to breakfast and i have stuff from 2pm onwards
Wait why	so between 8 and 2 im good
What’s at 2 :(	i have an interview at 2
You’re leaving me again When r u back tho Like 3?	then 6.004 review 6.009 lab hours
Oh big sad Ok how bout 10?	yeah i have like 2 hours between interview and said next activities do u want to do smth then
Wait I’m confused Yes 10 works or no	like i have 3 to 5 sort of free 10pm works
Sir 10 AM like the morning Not PM lmfaooo	oh yeah 10am works i think
Will u wake up tho	unless i have to do more interview prep i might have to wait do u just want to do 3pm
Ok ya You’re right That’s better Plus then Jianna can join	yeah thats probably more ideal
Cause she hasn’t done it	oh yeah cool oh lmao ok yeah
Lit shit Also ya I’m not responding to the breakfast thing cause idrk about that Idk kind of bougie kind of early kind of not my favorite meal But we’ll see Don’t forget WBL tomorrow! Not sure where that fits into ur plan	oh yeah i should be going to that
are you coming back soon i miss you it's been too long and i feel like distracting someone from their work	hi i knew u might try to do that so i went to the library lmao did u get the sticky shit off The thing I tagged u in was about ankur
oh i was joking bunch of people are over we're all working i just wanted a hug also lol that make more sense also when are you eatin g	Probably 5 something i'm in the library
Yes but I didn’t see your response And I wanted you to respond	oh i responded
I’m very proud of you Wait What are you working on Also How was your interview	6.009 lab been working on this section for half a decade it was pretty chill
Wait what You’ve been working for half a decade but it’s chill Which section are you on	the interview second part no lefts
Oh lmao I forgot I asked Come back soon I MISS YOU JAMPTHYGGDHWJSNV	lol let's go to mccormick for dinner at 5
We been made plans to do that But yes I give you permission to hop on	oh well awesome i don't think i'm going to office hours at 7pm anymore i fixed part of this lab so i might just try to get them checked off at the same time
Jamothy I gotta keep it real w I U Ur not doing the bed job sleeping Best Love he spirit Impressed w be effort The But if end result could use work 	I didn't drop my stuff off today I just came down to eat

idk whatever you're texting those other people	fine
i see so much type typey i'd like the same treatment please	"""do you want to come over to maseeh and play cards"""
omg you asked them thank you love you ish	they're not comming
for an acquantinace what	they'rein next
you hoe you absolute hoe make them come over	how
please you haven't texted me in a while i'm lonely	i'm sorry that you're lonely i'm sitting right here so how can u be
u rite	dave invited us to go to next but that's far
*said in jianna voice*	he's already there with saaketh and frank shree is at some zbt thing where are alice and tien
... next :|	lmao so we're the losers
always	big sad no can do
if u want some popcorn lmk i don't wanna interrupt so idk if you'll see this lol	i do
Oh fuck I just saw this After I finished the bag Worry not I’ll make another bag In a few Gotta wait a socially acceptable amount of time Before going back Cause you know I’ll be getting looks from the upperclassmen Wish your kettle could heat up my popcorn too	Lmao Ok Good morning where r u
I was in the bathroom sir Hurry up Yo Are you tryna go to harvard rn	I just showered
Lmfao Well that answers that	So No
I kinda figured Why didn’t everyone go to mit Smh	They were going to go to primal
I wanted to catch people before they leave	But decided to be wholesome
Lmfao We love that for them how long is your start labs meeting? dinner at 5? maseeeehhh	Dinner at McCormick?
Coming back to maseeh now Are you there We can walk over To maseeh	Claire convinced me to go to maseeh She's taking a shower rn
Dining	We can go after she's done
CLAIRE IS MY FAVVV	Canceled I got it to work but it's reallllly fucking slow on the third test case
How slow? Like number of seconds?	188 Like That slow
Jesus	And idk why the top 2 cases r fine
I thought you meant 15 And I was gonna be like Don’t worry! 20 second max	No smh the time limit is 20 Yeah
Do you have nested for loop or solenshit Some shit Wait also the checkoff questions I looked at them Kinda confused about one So I want to check w you before 042 or soemthing Just telling you because that increases the chances I won’t either Forget	No I removed as any for loops as possible Many*
And it’s still that long? Tf	Yeah idek man I'm lost does it have to do with another function it's using by any chance But as far as I know it's just like Contains Also I may grab lunch before 6042 Forgot to eat
Oh I have a meeting at 2:15 I meant like Right before Wait what class are you in rn	004 Ben isn't here for some reason tho I wonder if he forgot we had class
ok well since ur free and have no boyfriend to distract you let's just talk about it now The tradeoff between using iteration and recursion when implementing the __getitem__ method wouldn't either method basically be doing the same thing like ultimately you have to keep hopping from node to node by searching all the children and looking for a match so the runtime is the same it's just about like style? like i don't get what tradeoff they refer to (this is the from the list of tradeoff questions) *checkoff	Yeah I think so And I'm in class Actually paying attention So
yes but this is also relevant to work	Well yes
like at least i'm not wasting your time per suual	But I need to learn
well ok just a couple more things then How using your other methods helped in implementing autocomplete did you use a lot of your other methods in autocomplete? cause i rlly did not	Like Contains?
yeah i used iter but that's it and like iter uses other methods? oh just a couple other things for iter you have a helper recursive function right?	Uh Not really
really how long is your function like how many lines of non-commented code make up iter and if you weren't recursing how were you keeping track of the path?	Like 8 Less than I think
interesting mine too	I was yielding from a recursive then adding the path to each Sorry not yielding but Creating a list from yield
idk what that means but it's fine also last thing promise How you were able to keep track of the prefix associated with each node without explicitly storing the prefix itself for this are we just supposed to say we recurse and add one letter at a time like what do they mean	Yeah
k have fun in class brother listen lots absorb the knowledge and shit sir irresponsible on your *computer* in the middle of lecture the never nerve	why is she reading these out loud
idk but i'm kind of amused ngl my fave lecture	i haven't written notes yet
usually it's like blah blah boring math	so that's a plus right
but this shit so funny like she has my full fuckin attention	what was the point of making the TAs wear those costumers costumes
idk what's the point of the little	they stood up for like 2 seconds
gimmicky things ever ans: there isn't one	i hate clapping i'm done clapping forever
lotta work?	yeah
i want chipotle	make it work anjalie why is it sllow
i didn't eat lunch maybe i should go after this	sm fucking h
it's like 5 minutes away wanna come	we're having like
pretty pretty pleaseeee	two totally different coversations here i don't like chipotle that much
yeah but they also have poke	doordash it
and cava	poke is meh
like two mins away	cava sounds even more meh
door dash has a minimum that i can't match and i'm not paying $15 for chipotle wait there are so many places along that street sir and that street is literally five minutes away what about starbucks!! you have a gift card right? and star bucks is that way	finished it when i was home
well you still like starbucks	only when i have a gift card for it also i need to finish this lab and do more of 6.004
what about dumpling daughter and clover what if we debug ur lab AT chipotle so it's like perfect because we're multitasking and i'm getting something great out of it AND you're getting something great out of it you feel? mutual happiness	it's a tuesday
so?	let's go out on friday
it's not going out it's literally fast food	but out
but we're already out like think of it this way we walk 5 minutes today or 20 another day and that's each direction so i'm saving you 30 minutes of walking AND blocking out time to edit ur lab RIGHT NOW and then we can check off before WBL	ughhhh fine
and then you'll be done w WBL for a long time *009 sorry the dub sound confused me there	let's get this shit done before we leave chipotle and then i'll go back and do 6.004 yay so fun
or we go to chipotle buy the shit then go to building 12 close by and do ur lab and then keep working there till WBL	why specifically there
and minimize walking oh just cause it's on the way back when speaking to you	to wbl?
i try to minimize walking at all coss just like back to campus in general including WBL plus nearby checkoff if we wanna go to 36	where is wbl again
*34	isn't that building 1 oh
then we can just stay in this area	checkoff isn't until 7 and i want to eat dinner ? oh u mean
why don't you just get something at one of 20 restaurants on the street	get early dinner at chipotle liike after class?
well i was gonna buy now and eat at like 5 but ya like i'm saying while we have energy we acquire food	i didn't bring my wallet
then camp out and work for 2.5 hours i can pay and u venmo me the magic of online credit transactions !!	but ughhhhh
dumpling place has really good noodles	ok fine is it on the way
	noooooo
it's like 30 seconds out of the way to chipotle	does guac cost extra at chipotle
if you get meat yeah	:O
if you get vegetarian it's free	meh
omg eat at chipotle!!	i'll find something
queen!! you haven't had it in so long maybe you actually love it plus chipotle you get a FUCK ton of food you can't deny and that's always a plus	i'll think about it
oMG neVER loVED you MORE	did u use yield from in iter because i just simplified my code down to 5 lines but there's a nested for loop is this 2/3 because the host is asking the contestant if they want to pick the remaining 2 boxes together
my item has two yields but one for loop	which each is 1/3 i have two yields as well
wait jk	i'm iterating over key and iterating over each trie in key
yes nested for loop	okay
are you still at 180	i couldn't think of another way yeah if it runs longer than 20 seconds i mostly just stop it
but like have you done anything that might make it shorter since you last timed it	i changed make word trie and make phrase because i wasn't sure if it was being used implicitly somewhere but it just made everything but that part faster
how many seconds do all the other parts take like if you comment out the last part the whole lab?	like not very long
(last part meaning just the third test of filter) wait just test it	hold on
it shouldn't be hard to get a number right	25 seconds
hmm okay interesting	is that long
bit longer than expected well like mine's around 15 i think so i'm wondering if it's like	corpora and autocorrect take a bit on the big cases
everything is multiplied	wdym multiplied
like if all ur things are taking like 1.6 x then if my last case is 15 urs is gonna be > 15	just cuz my computer is slow?
wait might be the way things are written? not sur don't think computer would have that big an effect have u tried it on the server? or only on your comp	i tried it on the server a while ago before i made some small optimizations
and it timed out?	the last case yeah
you should've sat up here	the second to last one was 5 seconds
i need something to rest on	but everything else was like sub 3 mostly sub 1
sort of just place my entire body weight in an inelegant fashion	well
hmm ok	i'm glad i didn't
we can look after it's hard without seeing your code since  you're not sitting nearby which his on you	omfg ok did u use autocomplete or autocorrect in word_filter it's not necessary right or we're not supposed to right
i didn't use jack shit i basically think it's separate doesn't really build off the other shit i feel	ok i didn't either
i bored make it end was more fun at the beginning now i'm tireeeddd nap time!	I don't get what she's explaining rn
nothing of use don't worry useful stuff	Well thanks
starts next lecture she's explaining like basic probability like the intuitive kind but she's doing so in a very convoluted way	hm
but once you see problems in recitation tomorrow it'll seem less unclear cause it'll be normal shit	lmao ok thanks ig

I going to tennis tonight?	oh wait you're asking if i'm going to tennis not u right was confused for a sec uh i have startlabs so i can't at dev meeting rn will add to spreadsheet

i thought calling would make it silent buz not urgent my b but i opened the message so it shows as read so kind of urgent arguably	What message
"an emergency trying to plan a meeting time and she said hey for sure! I’m free tmrw and sat before 12 and then around 12:30 Sunday and i want to say like i have class at 10 so we could do 9 tomorrow or anytime before noon on saturday but also it's not useful if i don't give a tie so how do i convey all that information without sending a fuckin paragraph how's: awesome! how about 10 on saturday? I could also do 9 tomorrow if you prefer? or should i say ""if that works better"" think she might not wanna wake up early tho i would prefer tomorrow tbh"	Don't u have class at 10
yes but it's like one hour usually	Just say I have class tmrw at 10 so I'd prefer 10am on Saturday but I can also do 9am
wait no i prefer tomorrow cause then it's like i get up early and it doesn't interrupt work flow on saturday you feel ok i sent it YOLO BROLO	Oh Then The other way around Okay Good luck
ok i have more questions I need caption ideas Help URGENT these are the pictures	For instagram ?
Yes Something Halloween related Cause the joke was that we wore the wrong jerseys and wrong sports To the Celtics game You fee Feel Let’s hear some high quality ideas	April fools this was a Celtics game
Ok that’s not bad I need a few options And then I’ll send out a vote To my next tier of advisors (You’re tier 1) (Ideation)	Something to do w the word trick Trick shot?
I was thinking like	Idk basketball
Halloween x Celtics game (it’s a costume cause we LOVE the Celtics) Which is sarcastic cause it be well known I hate them	Mm that's pretty standard sarcasm
But idk that makes sense My friend suggested	Pretty anjalie sarcasm
The only day it’s acceptable to be someone you’re now #fakehoes But I feel like that doesn’t play off basketball	Tricked everyone into thinking we liked the Celtics As like irony Spooked the Celtics so much w our jerseys they won They accidentally won That's it I'm out of odeas Didnt know they gave out gifts on Halloween too #howdidthecelticsevenwinfucktheceltics
Okay those are excellent This is why I pay you the big bucks Thank u for your service I gotta pick now	OK good luck There is a FUCK TON of candy outside of Bianca's room FUCK
let's go get some!	Out of ALL THE CAPTIONS you could've chosen All my comedy gold
Are you done now Can I call	yeah i'm done

never mind lol just working w angel	oh like if i was sleeping later u wnat me to do smth ?
they have like small tables and her hall is silent	mm i see
tbh better than working in maseeh not even gonna lie	the lounge is too central in maseeh there's no like breakoff areas
yeah exactly but they also have no big common space which sucks for like when all of us wanna pset together but also like it happens	yeah thats true but who is ever effective when psetting in large groups anyways
fact	my eyeballs hurt i've been wearing my night contacts though so i feel like visiony
omg a responsible queen	yeah facts i need this sort of motivation in my life
did you know masses 5 is like clearing out cause all the guys in phi sig are going to live in the house which means there might be some of open doubles....	u really want to move to maseeh five though a dude let LADYBUGS out on that floor LADYBUGS
If I’m in a double Yes Beggars can’t be choosers And at least they have some floor unity And also	but what about jianna and claire
Doubles They can move too	i feel like it'd be so hard to move mid school year too
We could have fucking neighboring doubled	we can see if it's possible i guess
I can’t Not be allowed To function After midnight Like I am physically incapable In the last 26 hours I’ve eaten a piece of chicken and half a slice of pizza So if I want to use the kettle I need to be able To use the fucking kettle And also I have to wait till Claire rustles and stops making noise to time my sleep schedule And I sleep less this becomes more of an issue Like if it’s 7.5 instead of 8 I’ll live But like 4.5 instead of 5 Feels fucking bad man Which reminds me	wait just use the kettle
I’ll be waking up st 7 tomorrow	u can take it outside too or smth
So look forward to that	oh my god why
To get breakfast As soon as it opens	aight do u want anything from my cabinet i have food
No I do too but like I just don’t want crackers Idk how to describe Too many crackers in last month Can’t stand crackers I’m not actually trying to move to maseeh 5 Mostly just jump out the window or soemthing	i think u should sleep now i feel like you're very tired right now
Not tired Have work Just hungry Sleeping anyway Cause I can’t function	eat then sleep you're not like functional rn it's not healthly healthy
It’s not because I’m tired	okay you're not tired but you should still sleep anyways

I’ll just tell her This guy loved you And got mad When you didn’t love him back	… Wait don't actually say thay Cuz that's like I feel like that's personal to him

Hehe We love that!	I have to call my parents tonight after review session So I might not be back get away
Well luckily We all live in the same room So we can do it Whenever you get back	lol ok will u grab me a brownie from study break wait if the company is having a merger in 3 days and we have to redo the analysis should we even bother using the same stock unless u want to well u probably have the background about the company ig up to u u shouldn't use the water currently in the boiler it was the water i used to clean it the first tiem but i didn't pour it out yet
Well the quantitative analysis Is a very short portion Compared to qualitative analysis Also it gets finalized But the hope is that The tickers won’t merge for a bit So it should be fine?	ok sure
But if you wanna do a different stock I don’t mind	uhhhhh not particularly but
Not using the boiler just noticed it And was confused	oh yeah
I thought it was gonna be A Christmas present It’s not Christmas  	he just said something about maximizing utility please stop sending me emojis
Wow that sounds like something I would say Also he’s not dating that girl Necessarily They might just be hooking up So then I’m allowed	so
To send all the emojis I want	it's reasonable
No	what does this have to do with anything
Nothing I say is reasonable Well it means he’s single	wow
And perhaps	okay
Attempting to mingle	or get over his gf
	ex
Either way You Could be You know  	i'm gonna stop u right there
Why You said There are minimum red flags Compared to any other non cuffed male So this is all I got	Just because somebody doesn't have red flags doesn't mean they're automatically in eligible bachelor pool
Uh Why not Isn’t that the definition If the eligible bachelor pool Like no red flags	No…?
Yes Everyone single is in it And then you take out All the people That have something wrong And you’re left with the best people	That would be a lot of best people
Good luck!	Thank u sirr

Are you gonna try to LA next term?	I'm actually gonna be LAing for 004 so I don't think I will for 009 LAing for 009 seems like a lot of hours
Are you UROPing Also are you taking four or five Idk how to gauge where the line of overcommitment is Cause all the hours seem to add up but then I also don’t know how much time other things are gonna take and the result is that I’m confused	Bro same Ideally 5 most likely 4 Its nbd if it's just 4 for me Will try Haven't started looking yet
How many hours is 004 LAing Laing is an odd verb but I kinda like it Which one is ur 5th I remember 006 036 801	608 802 *
Sorry meant 802 lol	it's really flexible so i can choose 4-10 hours a week p chill imo

Ok thanks	R u on small side
Yes The correct side Always Donee esta R u guys coming? Don’t we have to leave soon?? Are you in 26100? Don’t see your beautiful face sir	Yes I'm here
do you feel like we should wear like sneakers to fencing today or hwat like does it matter	Sneakers Not vans for sure lmao
um you're getting lunch at 12 right	Yeah Wait u can't see my feet I'm wearing vans
and you'd consider me like a close friend right	Lmao Yes
here's the thing	Wjy Do u want me to wait or smth
i forgot that i have 18.600 next hour because it was cancelled last week (which is also a problem because that means no lunch for me but imma deal with that at another time) but anyways i realized this minutes ago and too am not wearing proper shoes so is there any possible chance you could grab like the black sneakers	Yeah sure
that are right by the door	On your rack?
gracias mi amor! yeah they should be very easy to find they're on the second shelf thing thank you my great truly excellent often astounding sir!	Lmao I don't like this version of u Unnerving
what the gracious version? bitch why are you cancellign	Oh jesus
saturday you better have a good fucking reason cause i already put  this shit in my google calendar	Depends what time
is someone dying? is someone planning on dying at noon cause we can work around that we really can	"I have mcg ""interview prep"" 1230 to 230 I just have to show up But stay"
that's a big fucking block of time	And listen
how dare they do they not know	Let's go at 11am Brunch
i can't i'm only free at 12 so like 12 - 12:30?	Lmao Just go without me Let's not reschedule any more
oy never but also historicall when you call me do i pickup or like does it go through	It like Never goes through
ok i figured out why	I've called u three times in a row before
HAHAHHAA so remember how	Yeah wtf
you sometimes block me on messenger	So this is your fault
i blocked you	You always just like
sometime idk how long ago	What Wow
literally might've been months ago	Ridicukous
like i definitely told you i was like fine i'll block you too	So you owe me for all the times you've been like
but couldn't over messenger but i don't think i ever unblocked	"""no it should go through"""
so potentially for the last 1 year or so potentially more or less that's been the problem IM DEAD and yes that's my b! oops!	…
Sorry?	Apologies can't fix this injustice
Yeah but can’t the dog wagging it’s butt? I feel like he can fix anything!	Nope
What are you guys doing?	Going to get lunch
Going where tho	M
Wait what Why were you walking In that direction If you’re going to maseeh D Can you please just explain sir	Thomas wanted to see his admission file
You can do that Have you seen yours	No
Oh	U can't
Lol Ok I kinda figured So you guys just wanted to like Ask really nicely In case they were feeling ur vibe today And we’re like sureee have a looksie	Idk Thomas thought he might be able to see the comments
That’s funny Sad it didn’t work Wya We can leave at 6? You coming?	i can be out by 5 we're barely halfway through the meeting i think this is the earliest i can leave but i'm trying
Ok just let us know	Sorry yeah I'm omw in 2 min
Did u see her at the MCG thing? I feel unsatisfied with that ending Smh Like to the point where I probably cannot ever rewatch it because I am irritated	Agree Poor John Ambrose
Like it just doesn’t make sense They wrote his character To be such a better match for her Like what?!	I think the point is that Love isn't always the easy route Dedication matters too
Wait but like He almost cheated on her He constantly takes the easy route John Ambrose is compatible and loyal and interested	O feel so bad for him
Peter is flaky and half present and bad at communication	And he knows how to play the piano
And John Ambrose just gets ducking dumped Like they don’t give him anything Jen gets a best friend And Chris and Trevor get each other And he gets jack shit Why they gotta do him like that	:((
I thought you were sleeping, you fool! YOU FOOL (I mostly just wanted to call you A FOOL) But I hope you’re imagining it being said with emphasis the way you say it out loud FOOL	just say it fool
F O O L 	just sleep omg feels like u need it more than i do
Bitch I could say he same to you Uh No sir But my alarm Be going off at 8 tomorrow So yay for that	sbc breakfast? will u wake me up then too
Yessir actually?	i want to get up a little earlier tmrw so i can eat breakfast
Don’t u have a 9 am tho Ah ok	my alarm will go off then too
Down	but just in case i miss it
I’ll come with If you hurry	ok cool lol hurry is a relative term but yeah
I’m tryna be done eating at 8:45 ish	i want to leave more time for myself tmrw oh that's perfect
So wanna go down like 8:30 Or 8:35 latest	i want to go down at like 815 bro
Oh really Okay down	if i can we'll see my condition tmrw
Hahahaha Ya I have a feeling	i don't usually sleep well first couple days of my period anyways
You’re gonna swat at me	lol
When I try to wake you And make that sound	i would never swat
And then I’ll try to hug you	i always make that sound
And then you’ll get angry	oh goodness no morning hugs
Also we didn’t even hug eight times today	8 is a large number sir
But you’re in bed So there’s no where to run	oh jesus
It’s perfect	scary
And you’re fluffy	ok i'm shutting down gn false
So it’s a fun hug	I don't think they will but if they have name tags will u just grab mine I forgot to tell them I wasn't going
They have a sign in but it’s like you put your signature but your name But you just write in name tags so it’s not that formal	Oh sad Alright it's good What's up
Dw Ben picked up just curious do you have an eta on when ur getting dinner and/or if it will be in maseeh	No ETA And probably not maseeh I want MCC cereal now
ah ok ig i'll just go now then	Yeah good idea
HAHAHAHAHAHA Ben wrote this probably	I literally just Couldn't tag u in this
Can you possibly do me the biggest favor if you have the chance when you get back My 8.02 pset is on desk but someone is asking me questions and I don’t remember So if you have time when you get back to room can you send me pictures of my pset It’s like the only thing on desk and it should only be like three or four sides of a page If too tired issok / idk when ur getting back	Sure
gracias mi amor  Thanks!! Wait u archer and Ben Are gonna be such a fucking. Squad	Archer got in too? I just texted him
Yessir	We're all 9n different projects lol
Dude this is fucking excellent You guys will have the best time Ya but it’s only about free time In lab u probably wanna focus anyways Like more fun if you’re together but still Also genetic algorithms are sick Just the best	Yeah facts Lmqo
For clarity this obsession started in eighth grade	Oh jesus
Not with my swe Bullshit So I’m allowed to be passionate In eighth grade my Science fair project was Stock market prediction using genetic algorithms And look at me now Kind of foretelling my future without me knowing it Bro I’m literally so happy for u guys Now if jianna is w Claire in Netherlands Will be so fun	Jwaus Did jiannaget in To smurf
Bro idk Don’t wanna ask just in case Hope so She hasn’t read messages Idk if she’s in class rn I’ll lyk if I find out Wait if it was you jianna AND Ben holy shit Literally so cool	Lolll So fun
Plus now u guys can be done Applying to shit Presuming that there aren’t many jobs that could top this James Lin deferred Jane street for a year to do it Cause it’s so fun I guess Ducking wild	Yeah Well I should still think about it right
I mean yeah ofc	I'd rather do this over a lot of things
I just meant	But Yeah
There’s no stress	Agree
Cause if other things don’t work out You have an excellent option When do u have to accept by?	March 2
Also nice thing about smurf in my opinion	Fast turnarojnd
If that you get month of August off That’s so rare	Oh wait really
Yeah you check out July 31 According to Ben’s email So it’s just two months And then you actually have time to like Reset	Damn id be down to stay
And have a summer	Through august
Or like travel	What's a summer
Like if you’re working the whole summer You don’t bum around You’re exhausted the whole time You don’t see friends that much Not that different from school In terms of mental taxation Having a month off would give you a chance to actually not do work for a few weeks At least for me that would be a huge plus Cause I think burnout is something I’m really worried about ESP cause over the last couple weeks I’ve been feeling so exhausted And constantly stressed and sleep deprived And that’s not sustainable So one hopes that like a week or two to sleep in and chill might add motivation for fall term	Yeah OK agree Also Ben got the project that I ranked first lmfao I just realized Rip Genetic algs is cool tho
SO COOL IMO you got a cooler thing I don’t even think he god his first choice tho lol	how did they even do this matching smh Okay I believe u
Maybe it’s about who the profs want too	hmm i mean both the projects i applied to have the same prof who i had emailed prior to submitting my application
No I meant like	because my advisor was being dumb
Who they thought would be qualified for a project Orpast experience translates well	lol thank for trying to explai
I mean I’m just saying it’s probably for the best And I’m sure if u choose to do t you’ll learn a ton and have an interesting project She’s going right now What do I do	We'll just tell her It's fine
Should I Before she goes down	No we'll just tell her not to eat that much
Ohhh ok I’ll meet you guys at lecture directly then	Can't meet me if I'm not going
She thinks I’m a nut I was like wants you to wait And then I was like Wait jk she’s already down Two minutes later Like a crazy person But now she’s coming Also yes I meant Claire	Uh Ok
Do you understand 5 Cause jianna and I are still confused	yeah can u give me an hour or so to watch my 036 lec
hi friend would it be possible for you to answer a couple of very short very concise very wonderful questions i have about 006	Yeah what's up
"ok perfect so like the first thing is for 3a why does 16 log (sqrt n) become n^16 like O(n^16) which i presume it does in order to radix sort also more generally for 3, how long were your ""efficiency"" explanations and we don't need correctness or runtime since we've already proved shit about radix and merge right? also for 3b did you use counting or radix and how do you radix if u is a constant cause then you can't do the polynomial shit but also it should be constant not even linear right? and then for 3c is it just like u<n^3 *4n^3 and does that constant matter when i apply radix's trick thing and also i asked yesterday but i forgot do we use O for radix or theta and then for 4a do you just say like we index into i-r and check if there's a value"	Radix for first 3 Merge for last
and then you do an extra comparison to see if it's within n/10 and keep goin if it's not but this is constant time	Becomes n^28 Half page total No
oh another question, did you just say universal hash for 4 a	I just said hash it
wait yo stupid quesiton i know for 4b we're radix sorting and that's how we get worst case but like what exactly are we radix sorting	the number age
wait nvm benji explained it all king! i was being stupid i just didn't get what you did with the sorted array since it wasn't something you could use the index trick on wait sorry i just tried to do it out but i'm rlly not getting n^28 for a?? where does that come from? also for b is it o(n) because of counting sort	Uh like send me a pic. Of your math? It's basically all radix sort right
wait ben said he got ^48 also for 2 i think you can use radix sort or counting sort to get O(n)	Can Ben send a pic
like there's no need for radix sort	Either works
"i told him you want him to ""send pics""! so expect them shortly"	On thanks
oy question on behalf of jianna why is 4a expected if our chains are always of length 1 like we don't need to hash just use a direct access array? because there's no collisioning	Uh expected no collision But could be
what? wait no because the number of reams is different so none of them will have the same index so why would there be collisions?	Oh I guess Unless u hash them to the same thing right Like the universal hash usually makes a smaller table Than there are keys So it's possible
but they're already integers and you just need it to be O(n)	The ream counts hash I mean
so you wouldn't need to hash the ream counts	That would make it a direct access array
you could just put them into a daa yeah	Which I guess u can do
and store the positions at each index	I already wrote mine up as
mine too	Radix and hash tho
so the hashing is just like	So it's aogjt
for fun?	Yeah For funsoes
are you back? btw wait i have a question is it O(n) time because that's how long it takes to create a hash table of n elements or because after the hash table is created we iterate through n times and find the thing at index r-i which is n * o(1) expected = O(n)	I think 1
wait so the second thing doesn't apply? HOLY SHIT IT WASn^28 hahahaha after all that i finally understand	Lmfao Ik
Are you getting dinner after this?	Yeah but my friend from novi is here So we're going somewhere
Wait are you eating or are you out More particularly Are you coming back At any point in the near suture ??  have you done the pset	Fuck no Waiting on Tai lmfao
has tai done the pset	Nope
i'm literally just trying to do 1 and i have to take a derivative and it's not working and i asked claire and she said something that didn't work and now i'm sad	 Sorry sir Idk either Hey I left my keys in the room Like my lanyard
I’ll bring	Thank you
To 006	Yee
	
Looked for your lanyard Claire helped too Didn’t see it on your desk Sure you don’t have it??	Shit lol Uhhh OH my left poket Jacket Pocket Should be there that's where 8 usually leave ot
HAHAHAHAHA I love that you remember that	I didn't wear my jacket today lmao It's like
Um I’m in dining hall rn	Culture Oh sad
But if we finish early	Ok Yeah all good even if no I don't really need it
I’ll go up Or otherwise we’re going back after lecture Cause we didn’t lock the door	Cool
So it shouldn’t be a problem	OK I lost it Idk here my lanyard is
:( Did u leave in hack room But you tapped in last night So must be somewhere in the room	Oh true I was about to go search the meeting rooms But I did tap on
Heard they cancelled smurf :( :(	Yeah they did :((
Do u know what ur gonna do now Assuming not tencent  for quarantine related reasons Also how was test??	No idk anymore Test was alright
Would you go next year The email said they would hold ur spot right Or nah Also that’s good Tbh you don’t really need more than alright for PNR Was the dipole shit alright I’m assuming it wasn’t a big question	Yeah but I don't really know if I want to go next summer Yeah I just guessed lol
Yeah that’s kind of what I figured I feel like most people wouldn’t take it Cause it’s very distinctly a cool freshman summer type of thing They also probably know this Which is why they can make the offer without worrying about how they’re going to also accept people from class of 25 *24 You know assuming there is a class of 24 and we don’t all die of corona	Yeah I feel like it's a bit early for them to be canceling it Which is just A little annoying Because we don't even have to go until june
I mean better than if they cancelled in June right? Cause then you’d have no time to figure out something else But I also feel like they could I cancel Un On may 15 if everything works out Idk if that’s how it works but maybe?	Sounded pretty final to me I wish they would uncancel
:( Damn I bet they’ll help place people into something else	Doubtful
Cause they probably don’t want to be fucking people over in march At least if u want to do Research on campus They can probably help w that Obviously not companies But still Idk this whole corona thing Highly inconvenient if u ask me	ugh idk aside from the people dying thing yeah i agree My sleep score Is Not good I got a 59 That is failing
whoops? it's PNR which means it's no record so we just erase last night also i think your thing is BS there isn't a world where like 6 hours is a good score	it depends on your sleep cycles like the quality of your sleep can be good and 6 hours is ok
wait	what
how does it know like your breathing	heartbeat probably
can it hear you or something oh shit it's attached to ur wrist	i have a heartbeat sensor
i forgot	on the fitbit
my bad bro	lol
i was thinking it was on your phoen i wanted to know if it like	omfg
connected to ur brain or what wait i had a phone app that made me a graph tho	i actually used to have one like that too
i think it listens to your breathing and senses your movement or some shit but ifk seems sketchy	ok wait i'll text u later i have to finish the pset
*at best* oh ew lame ditching me for a pset i see ur priorities	Yep
"wait i went through and found your email and i want you to know i'm dead so iconic ""with desperation"" the formality of your language just really impresses"	LMAO Glad u finally got it And that you're working hard
almost done w physics pset i'll have u know	wait there's a pset due on tuesday?
yup	the fuck
i aggree	are you guys still working on stud 5
Yessir	ugh like actually working?
Yessir We are not speaking	oh gross ok nvm i thought i was gonna join you guys but ya'll just working
Lmao You don’t want a productive environment Tough crowd	i want motivation to work so like people
uh Idk what that means But you do you	sad
Meet in lobby to walk over at 12:55??	down that'll be early tho class doesn't start until 110
No cause we have to put our stuff on I’m in lobby now Wya?? wanna go on a walk While they ride	Yeah
What did u want from stud Or likethe room	U just get whatever I was thinking any fruit but It doesn't really matter lmao U alright
Ice cream or no?	Me personally no but I think a good number of people here do want it
We have spoons right	Yes
Which kind? ??	Showering Berry mix Far right
Not sure if you’re on flight yet Just wanted to check that everything is good	I'm not but
/ you made it to airport alright	Yes I did How's u
Ok excellent I home now I sad	:((
Claire and Jianna started crying again Milo and Robert weren’t there	Oh poor bbs
Now idk what to do with myself	Shoeer Go back to sleep Not much else to do
PNR means you will not catch me touching them 006 practice tests	Smh Please?
Lmao sleep through my two weeks of break *a move*	Ideally
I made tai promise To call you every day Cause same time zone So it’s perfect 	Omg
Oh shit I was just clicking the emojis and this one seems perfectly apt right now 	So r u
	And ben
	Omg Fine
And you and Ben And Jianna and Claire And you and Milo	So annoying
And Milo and Robert So many pairs!!	Precosely So what's your point
You know tai actually liked you right Just think you should be aware That it’s like a joke because it used to be real	Yes No
But also maybe is currently Who knows Not me	It makes him uncomfortable
Sad he leans into it when ur not in the room He even makes the jokes sometimes	I feel bad
I don’t think it was that serious of a thing based on what he said Or like Less than milo likes Claire Which really threw me for a loop btw	OK
Anyways Don’t die Ok the plane Because	Thanks you too
That would be Suboptimal BRO	Tragic
I’m not gonna die from a plane It’s gone be From a lack of chipotle	I meant don't die in general
My mother has taken a rather like Strict stance On the whole	I would too
Leaving the house thing Who knew And now it’s like What do I do with my life	Self isolate
There are only so many walls to stare at Yes but what does one do while self isolating	Yeah that's hard Idk either So What r the details
??? Lol what Also r u not flying in the sky rn	I am In flight wifi Your conversation With benjamin
where does the notion of a conversation come from Also what are you flying Because everyone always has in flight WiFi But you know what I never do And something is starting to see a little fishy	Well I know he talked to u
if you know from him then you should already know the details And if you know from tai then maybe there was no conversation Misinformation is so dangerous these days Could be a lie propagated by the Fake News Media TM also what are your thoughts on like a couch or a beanbag or soemthing I think when we have a double and actual space in our room that could be the move Bro my Apple calendar is stupid and not synced w my gcal properly and keeps giving me notifications for my classes	I know minimally
Apparently I’m supposed to go 14.01 recitation rn	But I would like to hear what u decided with him Because I know the situation but not the result And I heard the first part from ben
I mean there was nothing to decide I don’t know that anything is particularly different than it was before We’re all at home quarantined and the year is over it’s not really like good timing for a result Or I should say maybe things are different but only nominally? Like an acknowledgement that has no guarantee it will be acted upon	R u guys going to wait until the fall and see if you guys still feel the same Or just start LDRimg rn
Woah chill It’s not that serious Feel the same implies like if school wasn’t cancelled we’d be dating tomorrow As far as I can tell this is not the case	Well Id like for it to be serious
Also if it wasn’t clear if u talk about this w Ben maybe don’t include my annotations But he conversation was maybe Fifteen seconds like	Yeah But Don't you want to give it a shot Like maybe not now But in the fall
“You probably already know this but I like you” “yeah it’s mutual” “think I might be in Boston over the summer we should hang out” “yeah definitely let me know if you’re in Boston” That’s the whole thing It’s like you were in the room	"""yeah it's mutual"" Nice Ok So"
I refuse to say the words I like you to someone	Will try over the summer
That feels like a commitment	Is what I got out of this
Not really	Are u scared of commitment
Most likely Well all be quarantined Cause of corona And stay in our home states	Will try the next time u see each other
I mean things will be so different in the fall right No more maseeh No more froct Maybe no more shared classes It’s sort of the worst timing	That's ok People can see each other outside of it
Also I have a lot of reservations For example I’m not Christian	O
And I will never be	Well
And apparently	Dont think too hard
That was an issue for Angel And would be for Ryan	You didn't when u decided u liked him
I didn’t decide I liked him We’re just close?	It just happened tho
Idk I think it’s maybe problematic Pls don’t say this to anyone but like Usually when I’ve liked someone I just have And then I don’t act on it And it’s repressed	Rrpression
But here I knew it was reciprocated and I feel like that changed like the progression And now I’m not really sure	Doesn't sound healthy Changed the progression of your relationship?
Of my thinking about how I felt Like with people in the part I could definitively know I liked them And here it’s like the circumstances made me biased Before I had time to be sure Not that I don’t	Because someone liked you
Just that it’s different than usual	?
No sometimes in the past it’s reciprocated but I only become more sure of that once it’s like developed How much time do u have on your flight/ do u have other things to be doing	I'm on this flight for another hour Let's just talk Idk I feel like
Ok well if you’d really like a brief history	Uncertainty is ok
also no one at mit knows this And will ever Great anyways	I do want a history
I liked someone freshman fall then someone else like most of sophomore year then they started dating my friend so I killed those feelings off Then spring of junior year I liked Jeffrey Shen	But
Over he summer I think I knew I liked peter but he had a girlfriend so I did not think about it ever	Nalu?
Then I continued liking Jeffrey through senior spring But he started dating nalu	You did like Peter aha
So I killed that in my head	Hmm ok
Also his best friend asked me to prom and liked me And that made me upset Cause I had no interest	Oh huh But
And lacked the balls to say no because I was ambushed after taking the AIME and was fucking exhausted	Its not his fauly That he liked you
No But he was kind of a dick About the way he went about liking girls	It made you upset that someone who was a dick liked you On Ok This is fair
No he just likes girls obsessively for a few months if they’re nice to him and then moves on He’s liked like Every person I’m friends with Or a ton of them	Lmao ik someone like that
At some point And feels entitled and annoyed when no one reciprocated Anyways sometime senior winter I got really close to Vincent	Is this before or after senior spring
Probably would’ve gone to prom with him in a perfect world Before	U got asked
Oh beginning of spring I got asked	Wait When does Jeffrey fall into this
There’s some overlap	Is Vincent in between Jeffrey and jeffrey
Cause I knew Jeffrey wasn’t gonna be a thing so I tried very hard to kill off	Oh
And while that happened Vincent and I just got really close And the difference is Jeffrey and I were barely friends till senior spring Like only once he started dating nalu did I talk to him regularly	Oh I see
Before that it was like friendly acquaintance Think I really liked the idea of him Because like all of the things I would hypothetically look for he had Like interested in CS and intelligent with a good sense of humor and very into politics and music	You called him judgy
Yeah because once I got to know him I realized He’s even more self conscious than me An accomplishment	Btw how did nalu and Jeffrey break up
I don’t know Nalu never told me	U two would make quite the pair
They broke up Our friendship is lightly fragmented since then I heard through Jocelyn	OK back to Vincent With Jeffrey?
The only acknowledgment was when I made a joke about her w someone else No w nalu Idk why she wouldn’t tell me	Because she broke up your friendship with her is weird?
And am lightly hurt that I’m not important enough to tell because we sort of confide a lot Because she didn’t tell me they broke up Ever For months But I knew immediately through Jocelyn Everytime we interacted I would think Why isn’t she telling me	Do u think she knew u liked Jeffrey at some point
Oh she knew Cause I explicitly told her She knew before they started dating I think And then after I felt this weird gut Guilt	Bros before hoes wtf
Not that I ever pursue anything ever lol	Be brave!
But I told her like sorry I feel weird not telling you	Pursue the shit out of things now
Anyways Vincent was the first person where like	Oh I see
I was avtually close friends with them Historically I’ve liked someone and not talked to them that much because of it and then once I decide to kill it off I talk to them way more and am like wow this never would’ve worked how excellent I wasted my time But here we were close friends and then I was like wow this is the person I most enjoy speaking with wild	Amazinf And ?
And I kind of felt it was returned tho to be honest I have no notion And then nothing And then we’re still close I talk to him way more than anyone else from high school including Anna But like He’s not Someone emotionally ready to date I don’t think	Was he
And also idk the other day	In a relationship before
After the angel thing I needed to rant to someone where I could speak freely and I guess in that moment I realized like Capacity for intellectual conversation is high And he’s definitely been emotionally vulnerable But when I feel really sad I found his response likely deeply inadequate and apathetic And sort of a rational take on what I felt was a large part of my life collapsing Also no he’s most definitely never been a relationship	So wait You talked to vincent
I just mean he’s not like emotionally developed yet	But while he holds intellectually good conversations with you He didn't make you feel better Where do you think you are in this Process
Correct also realistically he got into Yale and deferred from MIT and I thought I liked him but then it’s just like maybe some people are really perfect to be a platonic best friend And not meant to be anything more Cause I feel like we’re very close conversationally but I’ve literally never hugged him or been affectionate Which is perhaps the best definition of purely platonic	We hug And are affectionate Modeslty
That’s true but we are also not of each other’s preferred gender I would imagine you can’t date someone you can’t hug	That is exactly Purely platonic too I mean that just because u don't hug doesn't mean you are necessarily platonic But yes I see your point You have a POPPIN love life
Well yes but it’s like How long would I wait around	Do u want to wait for him
Till he gets to a point in his life where he feels emotionally developed or whatever And like what if when he does It’s not mutual	YoU know what I think
Also I don’t think I’m like Particularly qualified To answer your earlier question As Angel said I’m apparently emotionally immature But I think I have some notion of like What a relationship should look like And what I would want out of it And as of the start of college feel like If I felt so inclined I would be willing to be in one	You know
Which is different from high school where it was like	I talked to her yesterday
I don’t care if I like someone not feasible to date rn I have studying to do or whatever ?	I'm going to put my two cents in here first before I answer your question hold on I think that like people should just let life take them yanno don't bother to wait unless you're sure it's worth And even then you can do whatever and come back to it later And like check in and see If it's still mutual And to answer your other q I talked to Angel yesterday
Well I’m also not down to do long distance so if he doesn’t get in tomorrow it will officially be the day of killing	Because she wanted to know what you thought
Which I think I’ve slowly been trying to do since December anyways	Omg
What did you say?	Please stop saying killing this is a very morbid thing in your head
Ok technically there’s also harvard	I told her that I could tell you were upset
But killing will definitely begin Murdering	He got in there?
No I meant He’s waiting for that too Would take it over harvard	Oh yeah Don't start
Would place him on Cambridge	Killing then
I’ve been killing	Waot
Even if he was there are so many issues	Are u tryna kill Ben too
No	Issues are irrelevant
I don’t know what I’m doing there You remember at be beginning of the year When we were talking on your bed About red flags	Vincent has red flags?
Cause I was trying to figure out what you were looking for	Oh
No not vidnent	Me?
But we agreed on things about Ben	Yes
And those things haven’t changed So why am I willing to overlook them now Am I?	You know I have to go back on some things I said in the fall tho
I don’t know jamie	Because I think that what u feel is just What u feel And I have never started liking someone with all the considerations in mind It's always like
But like I don’t know	An afterthought you know
I’m confused What I want is like	I said this the other day to Robert remember It's just Go with the flow
Someone with shared interests Like politics or hip hop music or basketball	If it doesn't work out u can always dump his ass
And like someone with an excellent sense of humor	Just sayin Wow I think this is just a roast session now
And idk if Ben fits that bill Wait I’m not saying he is or isn’t funny I just don’t know Like I can’t remember And I value like interesting conversations And I don’t remember if I’ve had the like random2 am deep shit with Ben	You're not sure if you like him that seriously? Ben is also shy And doesn't open up easily
I think I like him but I don’t know like whether or not I really would	Oh like you're not sure if its like Temporary ? Because like
Sustainable?	Oh Hmm What is there to lose? An interesting friendship I suppose
I don’t know why I like him I suppose that’s the problem And yes a friendship Also would be awkward	Do u have to know why
Even in group settings Well before this I’ve always had like a pretty solid idea That it was xyz things that stuck out to me And those things were also often consistent And now I don’t know Also this is very long ago	Well What a special guy
But Wdym about Peter I never did anything to remotely indicate That I liked him	No I just Could tell
And I also didn’t really because he had a girlfriend So excuse you	You really really liked Peter as a friend I'm not calling u a bf stealer But You really thought Peter was the best of the bunch
I suppose Maybe you’re just insightful You see through me I’m becoming predictable That’ll be my downfall	Lol gotta change it up
U right bro Maybe I should be spontaneous	Who's next
Might fuck around and go skydiving Just kidding	Lol
I would never	Bet
Unnecessary risk No thank you!	Life is an unnecessary risk
Also Jianna liked Ben	Also I wouldn't either
I forgot that part This is so unacceptable	Oh when did u hear about thay
Wait I talked about it with Jianna Which makes me a shitty person	Oh ok Yeah
By the way	Jianna told me as well Lol you're not shitty
I’m not not shitty	If they were gonna date they would done have done it by now
That’s not true	Smh feelings are feelings let it be
Ben might’ve liked her back and she didn’t know And if they went on a second skdate They’d fall in love	He didn't I don't think Omfg Shut the
And have a cute SSP wedding He said two or three people	Why SSP specifically
I think Jianna	Why wouldn't I be invited
Would be an excellent choice	Oh I see what u mean
Wait no just ssp themed Obviously we’d be invited	It's possibly at some pkint
Cmon	He did But timing isn't rigjt People pass each other by like that It's your wedding bitch I'm planning it rn
Wait idk I don’t think you stop liking people that quickly And they might Make more sense In fact they do	Jianna I don't think Feels strongly About it though
I mean	I mean
This is also what I got but also	They do make sense but
It’s the only person	Why does everything have to make sense
She says she’d had interest in all year	Hmm Shell be alright tho
I think I gravitate towards mean people and Ben seems like someone who wants a nice person	She just needs to find her guy
And jianna is the most nice	Ben is not mean Lmfao
Like just a truly excellent brand of kindness	Jianna is nice
I am aware	But he totally enjoys it when u make fun of him
That is part of the reservation For example Jeffrey and Vincent Both mean people	He has to be mean? Smh
Yes but he can’t make fun of me	Lol And u want him to
No I don’t mean like a bad person I just mean	Thats fair
A sharp sense of humor I enjoy uh like conversational sparring Because this is the nature of most of my friendships	Lmao I've noticed
And therefore a skill I value	Use up all my brain power just to do this with u
And not something people at MIT do that much Guess it’s a culture thing	Only got so many cells
Which I truly appreciate So many cells!	Yw honey
Infinite cells!	Me and my two brain cells at 4am Eek Literally felt like Shit this morning Still do
:( Sleep when u get home?	Shower probably Eat some
Ah true	Then maybe sleep
Then nap!! YEET 	Or I could do 6.08 lmfao
ew Stop Unacceptable	Ehe Have u seen my rewired board So fycking clean nkw It was pointless but
Lmao I’m so happy for u	The arlesthetic
I love me a clean required board Hardware just makes me happy what can’t say	You'll see when I get back I'll send pica
Oh god	;))

Oh god Let’s not I like my jamie wholesome	Me too gd Dirty jokes are so easy to make now because of him
Hahahaha am important skill I picked up Am so proud	Also I've acquired the heart emoji as well
Yeet We’re out here riding	Yagayeet Remember that
Life is good No problems No virus	Riding what

Almost as good as dude	And then I'm like Nah And then I do it again
Brooopp I approve	Wait I don't use the word like When I type Why is that I'm speaking the same way I type
Because you type slower than you talk So you don’t need fillers as much Chase it forces you to slow down your thinking So that the filler is repacked by the actual thought you’re trying to have	Huh I guess Fillers suck I gotta stop using them
Yessir they do	Makes your language so Unsophisticated Unlike bro For instance
Precisely! I think we are currently On the same pager (Which is very glad about) Because I could not agree more bro	What happened To your english What's a pager
I meant page bitch	It's like
I feel like context made thatbclear Smh	Reading Jianna's text
Woah Let’s not go that far I have a few typos Sue me I’m really out here doing my best tho	Jianna went hard yesterday lol
Dude I hope she gets up early enough to finish packing Am worried	Omg I moved in my seat

Wait no it’s he lining of your uterus Wait maybe the eggs from fallopians too	Yeah so more like uterus blood
I really do not know	The eggs come out later Like a week later
Oh shit okay good to know Unless You’re pregnant	I learned a lot about obgyn when I was at sstp Oh
That’s always a fun option	Then they don't come out for a while
And then you don’t even have to have your period Is a pretty good option You should look into it jamie And I know annoyed you are by he uterus blood Modern problems require modem solutions	Sir
Yes sir?	I ain't ready for no baby Like Ever
Idk you’d be a good mom	Would I?
You’re very responsible Yes I’m telling you	Modern day Modern solutions
You and tai regardless of any jokes or feelings Objectively have good parenting qualities	Aw
Like if I was given a baby	Thanks
And needed to pick to people to give it to With the premise that the baby lives	Premise lmfao
I mean if the baby’s here for a good time Milo and Claire all the way	LMAO holy
They’d show it how to partay	I am incredibly concerned about that image in my head Tai's too good of a person I mean what about Robert
To be given a baby?	I can't really tell how good he would be
Nah Robert would be like	As a psrent
Gotta go drop some acid You sir here for a sec	Omfg But like i feel like
Sit	He's responsible when he needs to be
I just think he’s rational and repsonble enough but maybe not caring or affectionate Or at least I haven’t seen it	Oh hmm yeah Robert is highly analytical
Where you have to like hug the baby and love the baby And not just read quantum physics books to the bay He’d have asmart kid tho	My squishmallows are about to make it home bb
No doubt Omg so excited	For sure Packed very tightly
Say hi to everyone but babolat for me	They'll have to do some expanding Brenda*

i like that you yeeted something tomorrow idk if people saw it but i did jamie know that i did	;))) glad u appreciate my hard work
bro this is actually so sad we're so isolated holy shit like it just didn't feel real but now it is sad sad sad	life is difficult difficult lemon difficult i think this will be very hard
i think so too but also like since we're all stuck in our houses it'll be easier to coordinate times like when i first saw ur thing i was like oof that might not work cause usually when i'm home on saturdays we go out to lunch but then i was like O WAIT we can't go anywhere my entire life is free	lmfao i put it at a random time feel free to drag and drop
i sent it in the other chat	lmao why did u send it again
because i wanted other people to know i wasn't blowing you off but i didn't initially send it there because it felt out of pocket since there was a conversation	LMAO
that i didn't want to interrupt i maybe over think social interactions is what i've realized as of late but you know what we're thriving	quite possiblt althought i've never ever mentioned something like this to you before so this is a shocker ofc
yeah ofc and i've never ever made you proofread a ten word text or three word email so you've definitely never experienced my neuroticism ok i think we should have a rabbit movie night a weekly one like you and me but also everyone else is invited but you're required to attend like it's mandatory there are just so many movies we never watched bro i'm literally so bored and so tired i was face timing my friend today and the conversation kind of stalled two hours in and i swear to god i was falling in and out of sleep i'm DYIng	why didn't yall hang up and nap i took a solid 5 hour nap today down and now that's we're pnr is life even rela damn you guys were like my primary source of motivation i realize
wait cause i felt bad cause i don't call julia that much although now she's also quarantined in ny so i guess there's infinite time bro i also napped before like in the afternoon well i attempted and thens tarted talking to you guess that was morning BRO yes PNR = no motivation like who the fuck cares	wait what's she doing in ny
her parents are both stuck in china	i thought it was only new rochelle oh shit
they live in south carolina same town as tai!! but her older sister lives in new york	wait literally same town? oh so she's living with her
so she literally has nowhere else to go yeah greensville or greenville some shit like that i said this to her and she asked me which high school he went to it's called eastside according to facebook turns out she played for their tennis team in middle school small world!	oh wowww small world sat next to someone on the plane who was in SK knkew jianna
you know what else is small?	uhhh
the happiness in my life without you  wait that's kinda fun	oh that's so sweet
a skister!!	yeah she was like
on the skirling!!	i love jianna's famline
*skairline	oh god that doesn't work
omg jiannas famous you don't work bitch	omfg ok jianna is indeed she knew a lot of people from michigan too but also i feel like there's not enough michigan people so u kindof just know everyboyd
do you know someone named grace from michigan sophomore grace zheng i thing	you know what actually i have friends from novi who know her really well
(which makes her tai's wife legally i think)	i don't think i've met her on campus
(if i understand correctly) ah ok	bu ik she was hella good at math
wait really interesting	but i did hear some sus news about her recently not recently
she's like a party type wym sus?	but in her recent years of hs wait she is??? wild uh u know how we have mmpc right michigan math prize
wait yeah she's like part of the party wild side friend group of theta	WHAT wild
and i saw her super drunk multiple occasions at night the last few days	damn
like walking through infinite and in stud and at roadkill buffet	oh i justs looked her up i've seen her around before an't remember where tho
she's in 006 so maybe there?	no outside of it her face is very familiar to me idkk if this is the math grace but it's the right year yeah but anyways
i feel like it might not be but also like	there was some girl named grace in the year above me that was hella good at math
how many grace's in 22 at mit from michigan could there be surely not a ton	ikr and her dad wrote the mmpc exams or had access to them or smth one year and gave her all the qs and answers
oh shit that's sketchy af	yeah
i hate cheating in the math competition world smh too common man too common	i don't know if it was this girl though
hopefully not	like not to stereotype but she doesn't look like mathy
cause she seems pretty chill but yeah she doesn't talk super mathy either but you really can't tell sometimes	yeah but one of my good friends really looked up to her and we weren't sure whether ot not to tell him
oh shit sad	bafter that incident so
never meet your role models kids	i can't rmember if he found out LMAO why not
that's just a saying i guess cause they tend to let you down	wait really? i've never heard that saying
hard for people to live up to expectations when you build them up i feel like it's pretty common cause when you idealize someone pretty good chances they can't be as good as you think they are i think that sort of applies in life in general if you think someone is perfect then getting to know them will probably reveal that they are not	yeah i guess so you know what we should all do
idk maybe that's a pessimistic view	remove our expectations
waht/ oooh excellent move sir	yes no expectations at all whatsoever honestly tho i feel like this would make my life better too tho cuz like idk it seems counterproductive to be upset at someone for smth they didn't even know they had to live up to
yeah but aren't expectation unavoidable cause it's jut a valuation based on what you think like i feel like people don't go out of their ways to set epxectations they just have them right?	yeah i guess so but should we also exxpect to have our expectations broken
i mean no? because usually expectations are right the same way a lot of stereotypes are usually right whcih is inherently how they get formed? like the same way we rely on intuition or gut feelings?	wait but like people we idolize or good charater traits we find in people we expect it to be unconditional
ah you mean specifically expectations about people we idolize? our expectations in general i feel like you can't control expectations of the people you idolize because ether reason you idolize them is because you think that like they're really amazing inherently according to your sound judgement like that's what makes them stand out so to ackwoeldge this and then not have those expectations doesn't seem that possible?	well i feel like u can have the expectations but people are never like perfect right so everything should have a grain of salt
yeah that;'s probably a good idea to not place too muchimporatnce in them i feel like when people are doing it they maybe don't even realize they are which is what makes it hard but if you catch yourself doing it then it's good to not do it i suppose perfection is fake cancelled!	yeah facts c a n c e l l e d
Ok Need your helped Am thinking of posting These are the pictures I like Will prob make first the cover But I need a caption Also is this too many to post Rn all I got is “too sad to think of a clever caption”	i like these hmm ok possibly unrelated but maybe u can pull inspiration but if i were to write a blog post or smth about this moment it would be like the last 8 months felt like a dream, and i've just woken up or smth like that but it's hella sad
that is hella sad And kinda deep I agree with the sentiment tho	i mean i was thinking literally tho
You don’t realize what you have till it’s gone	like i never expected to be back in michigan lmao learning again
“Here we come ocw!”	"""only know you love her when you let her go"""
Wait lmao can my caption be	or something adele related
This post is sponsored by zoom #af *ad	yes lmao
Ok so jianna said us crying should be the cover but then I kind of feel obligated to make the caption About how this was the last picture we ever took Cause otherwise we’re all just crying	crying in the club but it's not the club and it's not a party
lmao	last picture mood is good tho
Hmmm this is also a good point Am confused Am overthinking It’s a mess The ice cream picture doesn’t fit sad Without cropping me or jianna lol	it doesn't have to be happy or sad just post whatever u like mine was happy and it was just 1
No I mean It doesn’t fit	oh
And I’m sad that I can’t post it Because it’s dimensions Are too thick	wait why don't u make them all not square like just zoom out the first one
It won’t let me? Ohh Ok final decision “too sad to think of a clever caption” or “this post is sponsored by zoom #ad”	i approve of either if sad vibes go for #1
In other news Vincent and his two best friends (which is a friend group I spent a lot of tiem with last year) all got in to MIT So that’s fun I’m trying to convince them to get a triple in maseeh Cause I think that’d be iconic	omg that's amazing
I’m surprised tho	now vincent will be right where u want him
Cause they’re all really smart But like Three asian boys with not much differentiation I like qualification wise	they're similar
I thought they wouldn’t take three people w the same app But they did! So now like four of the five people I really wanted to get in are in and the other one hasn’t mentioned yet But I don’t think she’d tell me right away either way So I’m hoping for five for five That’d be iconic	wowowo i haven't heard anything yet u never sent me waffle pics also
Only had one but it’s adorable	aw thanks bb if u have anything else i am collecting atm
Ofc squishy Can I send on Snapchat Cause they’re in my memories	okiee

I feel like you missed a lot of social stuff the second half of the year	yeah there were less pics that i took
Like the last few things are all	i don't really take pics so i couldn't remember
About positions and classes Like zeta psi party Or Valentine’s	omg lmao
Secret Santa	oh right i forgot secret santa sht
Ice skating or maybe if u went on retreats Also like blueprint and hack Maybe go through gcal	retreat was c a n c e l ed oh good idea
That could be a good way to find things You’re cancelled Bitch!	smh sad
Jk I would never Too much love for my squishy!!	yes u would
S Q U I S H Y 	gcal is a good point tho
glad I am somewhat helpful? Am feeling sad And isolated And quarantined Human contact Is important And a lack of it	:(((
Sucks ass	same
BRO	tai is going fishing tmrw
this is no fun	his dad told him
Lmao	to stop being a little bitch
HAHAHAHA GOOD ADVICE	meanwhile i am now
I see ur talking to tai  We love to see it	on season 2 of the good place
Absolutely LOVE	nobody else will respond to me
wait u should rabbit it	jianna's phone is still backing up
W tai	rabbit is dead i looked it up yesterday
Um excuse me bitch I am responding	it's called kast now that's why i'm texting u bitch
Ok then kast it Bitch	smh i don't have netflix
Would be very cute	was a leech before
Bonding Type moment	and now no longer a leech
Bro Use his	i'm too far ahead bro
Only one person needs it right	he'll watch it on his own time
So make him skip a few Lame This is how you lose Precious time With the ones you love Smh you should go on an adventure Omg climb Mount Everest That’d be so lit	omg no i'm not about to die omg
Sad	froct should commit to watching a show together or movie nights we need to schedule this
AM DOWN	sometime
I literally Have nothing To do	now you see me next saturday night?
YES PLS and I have no one to talk to Or like there are people But what is there to talk about Like Hey whatchu been up to Oh just staring st the wall wbu	nothing much just self isolating wbu LMAO nice
Like there’s only so much catching up you can do Am so sad I’m gonna go crazyyyyy	eek likewise
Bro who uses the word likewise anymore. Shame	i like this word likewise
Me too ^see that’s how normal people do it	same*
That also works Just not Likewise hi squishy! how are you sir?	hi squishmallow thief
100% error!!	i'm doing alright
*but my favorite error*	i have either been sleeping
jamieee	or watching the good place like
i'm so bored omg	all fucking day
how is your show	i actually
tell me all about it	can't do this anymore
i need excitement in my life holy shit	i'm on episode 12 season 2 it's spicy but i'm kind of dying also
how the fuck is this sustainable i made it two days and now i'm bored i cannot possibly make it 2 WEEKS r u kidding me omg i'm literally going to combust from boredom like i just want to feel alive and that's so hard to do when you're stuck alone in your house dear god	it's not and i'm dying
are you at home are you free can we call i want to speak to other humans oh my god i literally have nothing to watch nothing to read nothing to do nothing to eat no desire to sleep i'm out of ideas like i literally just have no ideas	omg haha i promised i'd call my friend from home in 5 but if u want to meet him we can grou ca
lmao That’s okay Have fun w person Don’t cheat on *insert name here* too much	LOL r u sure do u want join it'll be fun
Think removing the name will anger u less No no no last time I did that it was with Helen and her mans from summer camp or whatever and it was decidedly weird	LOL
So I’m against intruding on peoples calls From now on	it won't be weird
It’s chill really I promise Just Have a good conversation Like on my behalf In honor of me	are u sure
If you will 	it'll be so fun seriously
Yessir Am very certain	ok he has an assignment due at midnight i can call for 45 minutes
Wait really We should call in the froct group And if people wanna join they can	yeah wait actually i'm going to go brush my teeth first but yeah
And if not it’s chill	we should aightt
Ok lmk when u back	ye ok i'm back
Ok wanna call I’m ready Whenever Literallynjust sitting here	u start the call?
i'm scared of big group chats is that bad? i just feel uh	yes that is bad do it
social anxiety?	this is mental training this is what the good place is all about
wait i'm scared	changing
oh god	to become a better person
like video or phone?	video
wait so it asks me to pick who to ring can i just pick you and other people ge tthe notification not trying to bother every single person in the world i'm guessing yes	i finally got around to watching the big short although i'm wondering if u can explain the tranches to me again because like i don't understand how if the B or BB mortgage backed securities have defaults it fucks up lik the BBB or AA etc etc also i am planning on watching good will hunting at some point so that's exciting
Uh they were packaging these shitty mis marked mortgage backed securities under the AAA rating so people were down to buy them and thought they were super safe when they were in fact literally full of shit Very proud of u for watching it tho ALSO we watched goodwill hunting last year With 21 and now you see me Sirrr	Bht how does Like the tranche work Like in the movie Each type of mbs is like dependent on another? Where the B's are like at the bottom? Thanks tho I had to keep looking up terms as they were explaining it I was probably at the hospital
Well they explain it Well people keep valuing the housing market higher and higher But it wasn’t worth everything So it was a bubble growing and growing until it popped Because everyone is like oh it can’t fail so they want to keep making making these securities but there’s nothing to fill them with	Oh wait so the AA rated packages are actually full of like stuff below? And like just some combination of them Also what is the difference between a mbs and cd Cdo
The AA were eventually also full of shit That’s how brownfield made even more money Because they also shorted AA mortgage backed securities CDO is a package It’s backed by a bunch of loans It’s a type of derivative Not my favorite type That would be options They’re collateral when the loan defaults You could also read the book The Big Short if you wanted an in depth explanation Same guy wrote Moneyball and Liars Poker Which are excellent	Oh huh OK last question I promise Soyou know that scene where there's the jenga tower of things
Yes I know the scene	Are the AA rated CDOs or MBss or whatever like actually dependent on the lower rated ones or is it just like they'd also fail bc of general economic things once the BBBs started failing or smth
Well both AA and AAA are filled with shit Lots of the same shit And everyone focused on AAA being shit But AA was also shitty So you could make even more money by shorting those too Then entire housing market was shit They kept packaging CDOs and everyone thought they couldn’t lose But they were all worth nothing	Ohhhhhh Ok Makes sense Sort of
Next time we’re on a call I’ll explain it for you I think it’s easier in person So I can make Jenga like gestures	Not that it will be truly in person for a while
Also	But Ok
You should make a list Of movies For the movie nights And I will contribute	OK I'm down
And then we can figure out which ones Are jianna approved And just watch those	Lmao sure
Ok some quick suggestions Black widow Milan Mulan Bad boys 3	How are we supposed to get those soon
Now you see me	What is bad boys
Well no but we have sixth months To do movie nights Also I have no clue but they’re always talking about it Oh also Oceans 12 And 13 And ford v Ferrari And I’m your Chinese movie w English subs If you want	Who is they Ayeeeee
6051	Yeah that's sad tho
That’s ok Sad movies are good every once in a while	How do u know what they're talking about
Cause they talked about it In front of us For months Were u notnlistening They would check to see if it was out Every week Since like January And go on about that stupid movie And how brilliant the first two were	OHHH
Personally not my type of genre	U were taking about the movie
Lmao no What else would I be talking about *no shit	No I thought it was a side note I thought u said I also have no idea what they're talking about They referring to 6051
OH I understand Your mistake Don’t sweat it I forgive you Apology accepted	Great Thanks
   I miss you How have you been Are you still stuck in your room Or do you come out now What have you been doing w your day	I miss u too honey I came out today But according to my grandma I'm still in my room She wants to be extra safe
Oh shit	I've been fucking around I did some wood burning today
Uh In your room You started a fire Interesting tactic Love the spirit	No there was a wood burning kit
Does not sound safe	You know what Im talking about
Oh right of course a kit No	And I did it in the family room
I clearly do not	Omg go look up wood buening
OH I understand now I thought you were just lighting wood on fire I’ve seen a bunch of word burning videos	NO WTF
On instagram Wild	Yeah I did that I smell a little bit like
That’s lit Literally	Burned wood But It's aight
Hehe I got jokes for DAYZ	Wow Amazing Can't lice up
I want chipotle But I can’t have it And that makes me sad (That’s my life update) (You’re welcome)	I'm sorry But u should come to terms with it
You should be And I can’t There’s months of this Bro when this is over I’m gonna go every day probably And gain so much weight	I am currently Gaining weight
Bro probably same Am so sad	I'm not Hitting my step counts I just upped my goal to 12k a day
Lmao how the duck would you hit ur step counts Within your room Bitch	I literally Ant Can't
Bro walk in circles That’s the move	I just got my suitcases like Two days ago And I have been Too lazy To unpack Also I had a crazy weird dream last night
Bro I finally did it today It was wonderful Also what was your dream	I was in this huge Roman British place Like columns and open air hallways and shit And we were basically playing violent versions of like group fames Like fuckin Capture the flag And shit And I could f)y on a broom Like Harry botter And I had a sword that was like Percy Jackson's anakalusmos or sum shit And I turned around and accidentally stabbed some guy through the shoulder And I had to fly to the infirmary in some plain to save him Also side note I saw Tyler varun and Cindy in my dream They were just chilling on the second floor
AND NOT ME BITCH WHAT	In some random ass like modernized library place They were there to STUDY did u really want to be studying It was a hella weird dream
I mean yeah I like studying Sir	Ugh Wronf
I just wanna be included	Dude I don't control my dreams!
Well start!	I've decided to get into gaming
Like what kind of gaming	I think I'm going to try overwatch w my brother sometime Maybe I should try battlefield avain I'm not good at video fames So I'll probably get bored wuuckly
Boooo video games	Most likely same Look at my wood burning I transferred a template to the wood But then burned and painting was all me
Wait what the fuck That’s actually so good Holy shit How long did that take Damn	ahah not too long my brother did some too it was like half an hour there are different wood burning tips
Wait what the fuck That’s so cool	wait ik i got this kit for christmas and i didn't get a chance to use it until today
wait so for the housing form if i completed the renew thing do they just assume that i want to stay in maseeh or do i need to fill out the Fall 2020 - Housing Switch Lottery Application like did you just do the Housing Intentions Form and then Meal Plan or was there a third thing you filled out?	I only did housing intentions That was intent to stay
Ok so there’s no where that actually says maseeh right Omg 6042 is quaking The class not a room	Nope Lmao I did it Lol Also did this
Peak boredom activity tho We love that	Couple of failed rounds of jenga And I gave up how is your 8.02 pset progress
Haven’t started	boooo whatcha been up to
Not 8.02 I’ll tell you that much Jk I’ve just been doing a lot of work for UROP and GPS And watching Netflix And that pretty much sums up my whole day	:oo you've been doing work wild
Well I wasnt for the first few days But eventually I found motivation ish By not schoolwork	oops
To be clear	still haven't
Like have not TOUCHED any schoolwork 006? Who is she?	welp this is bad
what is bad 8.02 If you’re still worried about 8.02 I will personally come to Michigan To wack you on the head	no not 8.02 my motivation to do urop work
Oh well you’re not supposed to return till next week So you can just push it off My dude just said I could if I wanted and he’s like stranded in France in a place with no WiFi getting shit done So I’m like damn I have no excuse But that’s just cause my mentor is very dedicated to his project or crazy or something But they’re not supposed to have you do work till next week So no welping necessary	welpppppp the other thing is like my whole lab is just like entirely shifted gears to a covid project
Well bam You’re super off the hook	and my mentor doesn't know anything about the actual implementation but he still wants me to do stuff
Lmao what You’re gonna solve covid Bro thanks!	so the masters student that was like supposed to help me understand like pytorch in general is now too busy with the covid 19 project so i have no help
O shit That’s tuff	this is probably why i have no motivation now that i think about it
Ok well that’s a pretty valid reason	eh i'll have to think of something or someone to get help from i'll find motivation eventually maybe?
You have seven days to ramp up	eek yeah i tried to do a little more work today but i ended up not waking up until afternoon then spent another couple hours wood burning
That sounds like an excellent day to me	i'll show you my latest masterpiece later lol
Bro I think the break is good Omg yes	haha it's such a mindlessly enjoyable thing ok i gtg i have hack meeting lol
Ew tf It’s literally spring break On the MIT calendar And you guys have meetings THIS IS CBILD LABOR I’m gonna have a word w the directors	no today's the first day lol
On your behalf	bc we missed last week
Smh  How do u even zoom w like fifty people	hangouts actually
Not the point but ok Like who knows when to talk Cause you can’t see everyone You know what it’s fine Have fun! Direct we’ll! *well WIN! OMGVIRTUAL CLUB TENNIS WOULD BE SO FIRE	LOLLL i'm down
hi you might not be awake rn but which parts of 8.02 have you not done i'm doing it rn i have 5 of them fully done and three of them all like partially done but maybe if the shit we don't understand overlaps this will be good just kidding i figured out one of them so i have like half of two problems left	I didn't know how to do 2 And part of 3 or 4 I can't rember
i don't get the plotting part of 4 or the last two parts of 3	oh shit i just realized i didn't attempt 3d and onwards it looked too confusing i said germanium for both plots i didn't do the last calculations for the number density but i think it's just cuz i didn't want to do the plug and chug yet and i didn't do 2a and 2d
wait why for the first germanium has the smallest band gap size which makes it most like a conductor is that just like a good thing? but why cause they're all pretty close so i'm kinda confused	i said the band gap becomes smaller faster as temperature increases which means that within a smaller temperature range it can behave as both an insulator and a conductor
oh is a semi conductor supposed to be both an insulator and conductor?	and requires less energy to change it's properties i suppsoe yeah i mean isn't that why it's called a semi conductor can u explain 2a and 2d to me
i thought it just chilled in the middle also for the number density one what does Explore what happens to the number density of electrons when the energy bandgap is between 2-6 eV mean because how do you change energy bandage c that's determined by a b T	i think that's just the assumption of the graph or like the equation modeling it u just put in the values for the stuff u can alter
for 2a use circuit laws to get an expression for the currents in terms of V in and then get an expression for V out in terms of currents and resistances and then i substituted by expressions for Vin and it simplifies well ohhh u righ and then for d take the expression	wait what do i substitute tho
and just substitute like 1.01 R and .99 R	oh right yeah that makes sense
for the resistances and all the Rs canel to get a number like Vin = I1 (Ra+ rc) = I2(Rb+Rd) the currents on the two sides are I1 and I2 and so you get expressions for I1 and I2 which you substitute into an expression for Vout whcih would just be like I2Rd - I1Rc and then simplify	wait but if i get something for i2 won't it be in terms of i1 and if i get smth for i1 won't it be in terms of i2
no it's in terms of Vin, Ra, Rb, Rc, Rd it's two different equations i was just too lazy to type Vin = I1 (Ra+ rc) Vin =I2(Rb+Rd)	hmm ok let me try this ok voila it worked wonderful we both still have 3d onwards right
Yeah	:(( big sad
Is Eric working st google over the summer If he was doing step he would’ve met Thomas An iconic duo	have no clue but that would be lit
Was referring To his finst post If that wasn’t clear	maybe i didn't see it yet
Why are you still doing 042 What does that mean Are you okay??	The jenga
Ohhhh Hi I have a question Because I am unsure About the 006 thing that is being discussed in the chat	uh im probably not going to take the test with them i haven't started studying yet either but that's a separate issue
Ok see this is what I figured I just don’t know how to say it Also haven’t started studying Bro Thank god for PNR Except I want to understand 006 And I don’t really feel like I do Like when I read a solution I get it But imagine actually being able to think of the solution A concept!	LOL i literally have zero brainpower and zero willingness to actually do the studying ALSO did u add a bookmark to my computer lmfao i just saw it
YES AND I WAS LAUGHING And you were like Why are you laughing You didn’t do anything But here’s the thing I’m in it for the long game baby	LOL i was literally like
It’s all about delayed gratification	wtf
I’m so glad!!  You’ve been punk’d!!	yeah u had to wait a whole 3 months or smth
No this was a few weeks ago Like one month max Sir	oh well i caught on quickly then didn't i
Bitch a month is a long time Let’s not play I got you good Admit it	well half the month was just like me watching the good place amongst an assortment of tv shows and movies so fr this is not my fault
Exactly On your computer All day everyday And you STILL didn’t find it !! Victory is mineee	lol i found it now i wasn't even using that bookmark folder do u keep your old music that you used to like but don't listen to that much somewhere in your playlists i'm trying to do a reorg of my spotify tn to follow genre/feeling better but i have all this old shit i don't want to just throw away but i don't want to put it into my new plyalists should i like archive them into a similar genre/feeling folder i'm confused
wow honored ok so there are a few options 1. you could just archive old playlists like make them private so you have them but they're not visible but if you want them around either i like slowly phase them out	well u seem to know what you're doing with yours so
"like add new music and delete the stuff that feels old but then over time the old stuff is gone or you could just leave the old ones at the bottom another thing i like to do it like so i have a bunch of shorter playlists that all have different themes and those change w some frequency but then i have a few of these really big playlists that are like all the music i've ever liked or all the hip hop i've ever liked and so every time i add a song to any playlist i also add it tot he ""all the music i've ever liked playlist"" and so that one sort of represents like a history because i can roll back for 5 years and see how my taste has changed and if i wanted like could even recreate / remember like playlists from freshman fall or whatever just by sorting by date and taking the songs from that era i also have a lot of private playlists that were from very specific times that i couldn't bear to part with but also didn't want on my main screen anymore if the playlists meant a lot to me at one point but i'm tired of that music now does that answer ur question?"	oLMOL yes also i can't see what i'm typing rn because my stupid taskbar won't disappear and it's like covering the typey area
hahahaha	but yes i think so
beautiful	i was going to have archive playlists
am excited for the re design	but i don't know if it should just be one massive one either i'm so confused like i was going to do a bijection of old playlists to current playlists but that seems like a lot
yeah idk you never want to like force a playlist you know cause i have this problem a lot where i have a funny like cover or theme or something but don't have actual music to put in it that fits so i make it anyway	eek same i really like magic in the hamptons but
but then it's kind of not satisfying	there's like nothing that goes with it
cause you don't feel good about it yeah exactly	ughhhhhh this is so hard where does lewis capaldi go
you can do it i think it has to be incremental as you feel inspired i've felt spotify block for the last few months tbh is very sad	my inspiration always gets destroyed my desire to organize and make everything fit into a playlist
yeah idk maybe i'm the wrong person to talk about this cause i'm deeply unhappy too just about like everything happening on my spotify rtn sad	lmaooo ok so we both having crises
did you figure out what to do about 3 de cause i still have no clue	Yes I'll explain later I'm in a review session rn
Lol for what	Also where's the sign up to virtually host
Sir it’s break	Alex is holding a review for our recitations Where do I find that link tho
uh it came in an email from MIT admissions	Wait I just searched my inbox for smth from admissions Can u forward You're gonna host too right
It’s a qualtrics link So I already submitted so the link is dead now Or if you click it’ll say already submitted Cause it’s unique to my email But yeah I signed up  here this is a page on the MIT website think if you click the link there it will take you to your own page which should allow you to sign up lmk if it works/ doesn't work?	Oh wait Isn't that the stuff I filled out before
Uh wdym	Like the cpw host thing
It’s a new form It’s very similar	Oh the link works I'll do it in a bit Exciting are u going to do a q4 virtual pe
Probably not I want to shoot things And get my pirates license So there’s no point	do u really want to shoot things ok i signed up to be a virtual host
I want my pirates license	how many kids did u say
Which requires me to shoot things 2	ok same ok i did the reorg in 13 playlists
can you explain 3de for 8.02 when you have time	Yes Absolutely I'm going to take a shower But then yes ok so the dust and gas are in series which changes the current and the voltage drop across just the gas
I am confused Is there an undergraduate building switch form Oh wait So you only fill that out If you don’t want to stay in maseeh So like not doing anything will be taken as wanting to stay	yeah i didn't fill it out
So we don’t have to Explicitly list maseeh anywhere	no probably not
Cause they’ll assume it Ok got it	maseeh housing chairs will take care of us
That’s why I was so confused this whole time Bro can they take care and Stop lying about housing points And also give us a big room pls I was very upset when they said 5 becomes 2 Honestly just felt let down Betrayed	lmao ikr betrayed as well i'd host a virtual painting thing
How do you virtual paint Like drawing on the computer Or people paint in their house on zoom	people paint in their house on zoom how is yitian as a gta for 802 jk yitian's not even on the list
ok so like what more do i do to study for 006 like there's nothing to memorize and idk if i even understand it but i don't know how to make myself understand any more of it in the coming hours so like what is there to do help!	idk man i've only looked at four practice quizzes and i'm already done
wait for 1d on pset what did u get also did number 8 get shorter or am i tripping weren't there multiple parts before actually maybe that was just my other work i really don't know what's going on bro ok wait also i'm doing 3d and like what you said makes sense but the answer is not coming out and idk why	What's your answer for 3d This is 802 right Sorry just woke up
ok so it's like the voltage divider shit right so they're in series and add up to 3877 or whatever and the total is 5000 and i want the V just in the gas part to find E	Yes
so why isn't that 2500/3877*5000	Idk what a voltage divider is Why would it be 2500
because that's the gas part cause we need to find the gas-but not dust part	The resistance of the dust is 1000 the resistance of the gas is like 3877 righr And then E is V/d So you're definitely missing a d in there
wait what no i have the d i just wasn't typing it but i'm confused why is it 1000 and 3877 am i just reading it wrong	U said it was 1000 for the dust in the previous part right And then in the problem statement they give that 877 number
OH i'm so dumb i thought the dust was changing too even though it says the fucking effective resistance of the gas i'm just dumb don't mind me wait ok more questions what the fuck is the escape % i think maybe when i read the paragraphs that would explain this my mind just doesn t absorb i'm so confused also for 2 mm did you recalculate the resistance of the gas nvm i recalculated and it worked also for 1d did you say rechargeable is better i don't get the calculation i do to prove that cause i tried and it came out really wack wait nvm to all of that figured it out	Oh wow Uhhh I couldn't get the right answer on the mitx for escape percentage but I thought it was a bug in their checker
Wait we submit on stellar right	Yes Did u get the code checker to work right on the 3d Sorry not d The part about escape pwrcwntage How did u calculate 2mm
Yeah Same thing as first one Just replaced the numbers	Wait me too I got like 10.6% tho
What E value are you using	The E2mm
So the problem is E2mm is not 5000/.1 *3877/4877 *1mm The denominator has to be (.1-.001) Subtract the dust And the error is small enough that it doesn’t get caugh in answer checkers for d or first part of e	Oh F lmao
But does get caught on second part of e cause of exponentiation I only found it in discussion Cause I was also a little off	I was trying 1 - 0.01 or smth Whatever
So it ends up being like 9.14	I'm not changing it that would require rescanning and shit And I'm not down for that
Lmfao Tbh they probably won’t even take off Basically just a rounding error	Ehhhh Colleen yanno
Also How’ve u been doing Gimme life update Feel like I haven’t heard in a while	well nothing has occurred like literally i have enacted no action 'm trrying to do 608 rn but it's not working so that's depressing i gave up on this exam tn
How do you feel about classs starting	so that's great
How is ur sleep schedule	i feel awful lmao awful also
Are you actually watching lectures During the allotted time Etc	uhhh none of my lectures are live anymore so it's kind of a waste to go
No I mean like To make ur self stay on track	oh
Watching them when they would occur	uhhh i have lots of morning lec so u can presume that the answer would be no i watched 608 on 2x yesterday i only have two lecs on monday anyways and 802 got converted to qna i'll probably watch 036 later 9.00 is a complete and utter fucking waste but i've got to read the textbook bc our exam got released today lmfao
Lmao that’s honestly more than I expected And also more than I’ve been doing Told myself I would watch lectures at the right time To stay on that grind u know Has not happened yet And I’m guessing it’s only downhill from here In other words We really out here 	F everything was F
Life is F man PNR baby hi i have a questoin when i'm drawing a bfs tree do i not re draw a node that's already been listed like C goes to E and F and so does D	yes i wouldn't redraw it but not sure
for 3 did you use full dfs or full bfs	yeah essentially dfs ** did u do the coding for 6 yet did u do it recursively
apparently you can do it both ways and no haven't even read 6 have been accounting the whole day	accounting?
they try to squeeze a year of accounting into a week	oh nice
and i'm not hear for it here i can't even type or speel just die	so i think u can probably do full bfs too that makes sense but dfs probably finds contradictions faster
hmm ok ya i think it intuitively makes more sense but jianna was saying some ta told her to use full bfs but seems like either works	yeah jianna's ta has been wack
:( don't worry was not sabrina just some OH person gotta defend my ex TA!!	lol ok this is making me upset wtf
wait i have a question about 3 how did you keep track of ancestor indexes to tell if cycle is odd or even did you use hash table w linked list because then how do you update indexes and you finish nodes	F I'm 9 minutes late Happy birthday birchhhhhh
gracias birch!	":pp What ""celebration"
Bro Celebrating a birthday in quarantine Is impossible Especially when ur mother Won’t let you havecchipotle The only thing you want in the world	so what did u get instead
Uh Nothing Today is a rather uneventful day Which is chill Cause I mostly just have infinite work	:(( even tho i too have much works i just let it there ferment it yanno bro what your parents should celebrate u
I mean my parents are enthusiastic There’s just Nothing they can do We can’t leave the house we can’t order food and I don’t really have any gifts that I both want and am allowed to have So my mom put up like decorations she had and made food sort of but also like	awwwww that's so cute sooo cute
Were waiting on a large amount groceries on Thursday So rn the fridge is slowly reaching empty	ah i see this is
So it’s hard to eat good food	crisis mode birthdays bro i've been literally having dalgona coffee every other day it's so good u have to try it it's just 1 part instant coffee 1 part sugar 1 part water then u whisk it until it's fluffy and put it on milk
Not a coffee person sir :( I don’t really do	broroooooo why
Hot beverages	oh yeah
If u get some uh	i remember now
Dalgona lemonade tho	LOL
I’m down	lol idk about that one u like hot chocolate tho
Ok there’s an exception So dalgona hot chockate Boom	dalgona is the name of the color the coffee takes on when whipped or rather the korean street food which has the same color which is just like heated sugar sort of burned/fried?
to quote tai koreaboo *insert eye roll here*	f i didn't see this until now also what do u think of the phineas and ferb thing
Wait what is that I saw it in the I3 email But I was in the middle of soemthing so I sorta skimmed What do u have to do	you pretend to sing the phineas and ferb theme song for a brady bunch sort of video
when she answers peoples questions in the chat  Such an upstanding member of 006	LMFAO omg when i got that text notif i was like this is gonna be someone flaming me 
Hi I can see you Isn’t that exciting	hi honey why does nobody have their camera on turn it on bitch
Idk but I bet if	u won't
You did the mime motion People would turn their camera on To laugh	lmao fuk no
Coward	i'll do it in the middle of lecture watch out
Wait now I have to put you on my sidebar Instead of Alex Chen	;)
A sacrifice I’m willing to make Ofc	lolll
Can u at least Make your background Milo sleeping PLEASE WAIT WHEN IS OUR TESTTHEN what the fuck “It’s fun in that it’s hard”	lmao nice
Jesus Christ Am scared	i'll quote u
You’d be quoting Alex Also if he thinks something is hard There’s no chance	we're fucked so fucked
HAHAHAHA He’s so wholesome	fr
"BRO this quiz is so soon I’m
Crying 4/21"	f i'm not even thinking at this point bro text me on zoom
Wait I’m afraid My hand will slip And it’ll go to everyone Instead of just jamothy	then it'll be funnu check zoom
You know Wait nvm got it	what
My mom is watching cnn And she just said to me “You know Michigan deaths are going up and up. You better tell to stay inside and hide under her bed or something otherwise you’re gonna need a new roommate.” So um my mom says don’t die I guess? Just thought I’d share the uplifting news w you!	LOL thanks mrs kini yeah it is my county is the woorse i haven't really left the house in a while
Bro it be like that Poor Michigan governor	yeah it's just
This shit sucks bro	bad
Wow Your eloquence Never fails to amaze I too would use the word bad To encapsulate this Bro I was thinking A ton of 24s are gonna take gap years Which would fuck current juniors Cause they’ll probably have to take less juniors to make up for it Just a random possible consequence	i can't oh wait really oh shit you're right conditional acceptance - you can only come if you want to take a gap year but idk i don't THAT many kids would want to take a gap year
You think?	lol
Wait really? I feel like a ton of people would if it’s online I mean even u were thinking about it	i wouldn't have time to find plans for the upcoming year unless i was plannign on doing it in the first place yeah i am now
And Robert and Milo would have for sure Like I know a lot of people Who are considering	because like it's hard to find something to do rn too
Who are current seniors Ya but They don’t need to do something That interesting	i guess so they can just chill
Cause MIT will probably just say yes	i would just chill lol
Under he circumstances And ya just chill And so some research remotely Or some bs	wouldn't mit try to fuck up their class of 24 tho not* try not to* like they def wouldn't encourage it ugh i should take a gap year
Yeah but they also don’t want to piss people off by denying requests to do it	yeah i suppose i mean it's not just an mit problem it's a all college problem
Ya I think the whole class Will get fucked Of 25 Except for colleges who can increase capacity Or like People will be trickled down Like if harvard takes 10% less	wait why can't they just have a bigger 25 clss and a smaller 24 class as long as the total is the same it's like not a big deal
I don’t think so	because the capacity is the same total
Because you have a certain number of people Taking classes And Harvard has like Limited space In freshman dorms	we don't have freshman dorms tho
I think a lot of things rely on equal size of classes Yeah but 8.01 would overflow For example I doubt they’ll let it be super uneven	like i def think they can make it work tho i'm not sure if they want to but i think it's psosible becuase like even freshman here esp just take whatever the fuck they want
Bro good thing It doesn’t Affect Us	"lol ""not my problem"""
Hehehe I’m such a good person It’s honestly tiring	certainly i bet alsoisn't bellman ford runtime v*e so for 4 if we do duplication on the graph won't be get n^2 vertices and n^2 edges at which point this becomes n^4
Yessir For 4? No	yeah
You’re just running normal bellman ford? Why are you duplicating	yeah but bellman ford makes layers of the same graph inherently so how to we address that
Yeah but that’s built into the VE runtime	oh ok i'll trust u
The duplication is why it’s VE you can treat it like a black box Like you’re not duplicating and doing VE on each level Duplicating makes it take VE	oh ok i get it
you didn't;'t write nayhing for 6 right so do u know why they left a whole open page for it on the template cause it's irritating me	"LOL ik wtf i coped what they usually write for coding questions as my answer I literally wrote ""Submit your code to alg.mit.edu"""
Damn that’s kind of a power move I like it Calling them out on forgetting to copy and paste the two lines by doing it yourself Because you’re a strong independent Workman *woman	Lmaoooo Legot I was like Go look for it yourself
Also r ur explanations Very short	5 was a page long
Like specifically My 2	The rest were no longer than half a page Yeah 2 was the shortest Not even half a page
Ok chill	Like less
Same	bro if you're still awake sign up asap to do a maseeh event for cpw claire and i are both on the student panel this thursday and i also signed up to host the 4/28 student q& a that's 4 pts if i get to host but i might not get the host thing
Ok I signed up for the panel It’s just gonna be our whole room Giving a very diverse perspective on maseeh Lmfao Love that u got jokes OFC I’m awake sir Should I sign up to host something?	beautiful
There’s nothing I could host other than a panel tho so I guess there’s no point	yees if u can there's tons of panels u can host the movie night is also really easy to host i would've signed up to do that but i have a 6.08 team meeting right before
Wait there’s just the one on 4/16 and 4/28 right	for the student panels? no there's also like the parent panels the movie night is like next week thur? also my friend jessica wu is in GPS she saw your pitch the other day
From what school	nYu
Oh interesting Maybe I’ll do an outreach call w her And talk aboht all the reasons is wack	is that a coffee chat
For half an hour	lmao
Ok no like an hour	ok go for it
Just to cover the bases	i would be honored
Jesus kidding *just Woah Maybe it corrected to Jesus	i go by that too
Because it’s Easter	so does jianna and milo
And they’re respecting the dude up there Lmao Excuse me	i don't know about that
I accepted that as a name in high school Therefore I did it first	well things are different around here now have u taken the 8.02 quiz yet
Lmao no Have you	i haven't really learned too much of the material so i'm deciding how much to learn i want someone to take it and tell me if it's hard
Bro me neither	lol f i guess i could learn it as i take it too
Lmao that’s some quick learning sir	it's 90 minutes and it's meant to take 45 assuming no technical difficulties that's almost an hour to learn
HAHAHA that’s a bold strategy Ngl Also do u know If it’s just answer based Or we submit work Cause I’m confused By the instructions	wait we don't need to know faraday's law right it's just answers
Can we not get partial credit Cause that’s ducking Stressful	partial comes from getting the right answer on the second try for mc
If you have two tries or whatever Ya but for FR	and u get like 2-3 tries per frq for full
yes precisely	oh yeah ig savannah took it today
Well that’s no fun	she said it was similar to the practice quiz which wasn't bad but idk there were less mc
Lmao I have not looked at the practice quiz	on the relq thing
What a novel idea Wait how long is it	idk
How many questions can a person answer in forty five minutes jesus	wait we don't need faraday's right
I don’t think so Also practice quiz is actually pretty short I take it back This is maybe not the worst thing ever Ugh I have so much to do I literally wanna curl up in a ball Jesus Christ Lmao Maseeh 6	if it's similar to the practice quuiz it's not bad
Took the panel And maseeh 5 Took the board games	ik lmfao we're obviously less exciting
Wait did u text Jianna	but the board games was on a wekeend no i should oh fuck i just remembered i have a check in with my coach at 10am tmrw i need to sleep now byee
do you know what the last topic covered on the 8.02 test is like Ampere's Law y/n? or is it just through the end of week 9?	hi no i think it's just biot savart no amperes
Beautiful	i'm gonna take it in a bit let u know how it goes
Good luck sir	i just did it f i got partial credit for 1 or 2 probably but like it wasn't hard
Oh shit How long did it take you Like the full 90 or nah Was it actually similar to the practice test	yeah it was like 20 minutes for the all theq uestions and i got stuck on one so i sat there staring into nothing for like another 20 but it was chill
Oh shit ok so it’s super quick We love that Ok gracias Jeremy	yeah np
I like that you acknowledge your status as Jeremy It makes me happy	oh i guess
It’s sounds a lot like jimothy Which is Of course Ur real name So I figure it’s an acceptable nickname	jimmy is p common among chinese parents so
bro friday problem solving is so fucking long this week i'm offended	wait really i haven't looked yet hwo many questoins
Well three But they have like Tons of parts TONS Ridiculous Offensive Unjust	oh this is kind of ridiculous lol should we tag team it how far r u
Bro can’t they cut us a break on Fridays I just did 1 and 2	wait yeah f want me to do 3
Which had eight parts and four parts Yessir I can write up 1 and 2 and send	oh that's a lot
I mean it’s like they build up to one answer So it’s mo eight separate problems But it’s still a pain in the ass Especially for someone who did not pay much attention during her sequences 	wait lmfao i actually got 1/3 credit on one of the sequences because i've gotten lazy to thepoint where i don't even read the qeustions properly so the entire time i was like fuck this doesnt make any sense it definitely wouldn't bemoving in that direction
Honestly thriving in quarantine	and it was because i was looking at the wrong element like the magnet and the wire loop ti was asking about the fucking magnet and i was like wire loop wire loop N*B*a*b*cos(f*t*2*pi) also that's the answr for 3 i'm actually such a fucking g idk how i figured that out
But how do u draw the shit	yeah i'll do that in a second well not in a second i probably woon't do it until tn or tmrw but like basically the b field just becomes less perpendicular to the loop as it rotates and the current induced will oppose the decreasing b field so it should generate a b field in the same direction Ily bb F this is a lot dude i had like 3 things left on my to do list today and then i started putting in stuff for next week and my list just exploded to like quadruple the size of what it was my happiness was very short lived
Sad bro Life is Not fun Is the lesson I think	wait it's actually kind of tragic i was just starting to feel less stressed and then boom 8.02 adds like 5 assignments per week
DUDE ACTUALLY	plus my 6.08 final project is kind of effed lmao
ridiculous The nerve of these people Wait why I thought you had a good group	ok wait no it's not fucked but we divided up our tasks so that 2 people are doing the hardware and c++/arduino work 1 person server and 2 people website so i'm doing the server/backend work
Bro sad	dude i wanted to do that hardware shit
Oh	for the final
Bro happy	sounds like pain
I thought website would be easiest	website is like aight but idk react it probably is easier in hindsight because recnelty they were like
Wait so what’s the problem	yeah u have to convert our list of coordinates into a jpg image
Am confused	that the website can pull and u have to figure out how to use google's handwriting api which i htought would be easier or give up able but it was evidently not
Oh Shit	so i think i have to figure out how to use PIL to convert a 1d bit map (or even worse, a lit of coordinates) into a jpg lmao which is alright i mena it's tedious and kind of sucy suck y
Poor little jimothy Can I just say tho	lol
I’m so proud of u For not doing	the hardware?
Fucking hardware	yeah me too lmao
Ew! Imagine doing hardware	no wait it's because our idea is a gesture version of the drawful game
literally triggered at the thought Lmao	so they have to map accelerometer movement to a drawing
You and drawful	LOL
The love story of the century Jfc	really tho joe said nobody else was doing this compred to other teams our project is way less hardware tho some people were ordering things i've never even heard of and we just ordered an extra button lmao
WAY. LESS. HARDWARE. my favorite words in the world Lmao a button	Lolll
The height of hardware complexity Love that for you guys	Also look at the snow en It's like actually snowing rn
Bruh Snow in April should be illegal If I’m president That’s a part of my campaign Can I count on your vote??	Wait whaT No snow is nice sometimes And so weird to see in april
are you hosting the panel and that's why you moved to jeoparty or did you just leave us cause you hate us	i'm hosting it and i hate u 4 points baby that's like playing im tennis twice
oh perfect good to know w the mitpal that's 6 you know what i hear? a big double in our future LMAO if we actually live on campus which we might not	eek
bro this could all be for fuckin nothing sad	yeah what are my housing points even good for f
ok so between you and me i need you to throw me the softballs during the panel make me seem like the coolest person on the panel just kidding that's impossible	my mit pal sent me one really long question with a bunch of questions and then i responded with a whole 7 paragraph essay and then she ghosted me
bro MINE GHOSTED ME OFF THE BAT	one really long email* LMAO
i didn't get one fucking response like bitch i spent time on ur email tf	your mitpal sucks
yessir if she comes next year	no softballs btw
she best believe i'll be ghosting her	only difficult lmfaoooo
ah yes it can be very difficult to answer questions about maseeh the hardest question would be how's the food?	i'm going to be avoiding all dining hall questions lmao LMAO yeah
because we have to make it sound goo HAHAHAHA yesss	yeah no
wait are they just asking questions in the chat	yeah
and then you pick them	and i have like 7 written down from before also after lunch i'm gonna be doing the fps so i'll get the answers to u in a bit
are we gonna say off the bat that we all lived in a quad together presuming that we're talking about the type of room we had and stuff or should we make it a challenge and see if we can go the whole time without giving any indication that any of the 4 of us have ever even met before i'll be like oh what was your name again sorry can't remember and then boom the fools will think i don't know you FOOLS!	LMAOOOO yes that'd be so fun also the fucking last problem on fps was optional i just looked at it

earning my place at mit	it really be like that wanna sign up to do wbl powerpoint karaoke w me
yessir just signed up	amazing
ok so 6:25 right?	Yes
Nice background	thanks it's from the website
It’s beautiful You really give off serious moderator wives Vibes Where is the rest of our room smh	thanks i enjoy being a moderator also i just got more war flashbacks in 5th grade or middle school or something i took this world history course on coursera and even got a certificate for it and i was just going back on coursera just now to see if i could find a finance/trading/econ course because i want to learn it but i'm not involved in anything rn where there's enforced learning well i didn't even start searching is the first part but the second part is that i remembered that i took this course and for some reason it wasn't showing up in my completed history so i went and looked it up and i found it and i started the first video and the professor's screen just completely blew me away i was like i remember this background, this man, this guy's voice am shook
lmao i love that when you can remember being a 5gh grader and sitting there and watching these videos so cool nostalgia is the best man	dude i didn't even want to take that class my parents were just like go take a college level class on coursera and my mom was like oh world history yes take this random class that u will never remember a lick of content of in half a year also direct me to some resources friend
lmao your mother is iconic	she really do be out here
resources for trading courses online? idk i think books are usually the way to go but depends on what you're trying to learn about	not just trading like anything important i should know about finance and econ and markets etc etc i have a bad relationship with reading non fiction books unless they're funny but recommend me smth anyways
lmfao well you gotta be more specific my dude there is infinite information about finance and econ and markets that is perhaps the broadest thing ever	i was realizing that as i was typing it
like i need some notion of a subtopic you think is cool or something my good sir to be useful, i mean	i just wanna be more interested in things yanno
How to Win Friends and influence People is an interesting business-type book	ok how about u just recommend me a book u like that u think i will gain useful perspective and context from
but i feel like it's not so dry	ok
might be a fun place to start	i will start there
wait	perhaps
lemme give you a couple now that i have a genre	lol
i have a list The Four is pretty interesting and fun also the outsiders and freakonomics thinking fast and slow the back of the napkin could be interesting for you	wow
more consulting than finance	u also recommend me freakonomics everys ingle time i ask u for book recs lol
lmk if you want more suggestions -- started with the more story based, less technical dry shit ya because i want you to read it duh	i'm sorry i haven't read it yet i've checked it out from the library like twice and haven't read it
i recommend it to everyone every time also liar's poker is a fun finance one that's an actual story but you'll learn about finance along the way also recommend that one a lot	"i've actually been playing that game a lot recently w my family ok and just so i can search it up and get a feel what's your favorite more technical ""dry shit"" book you'd recommend me also watching demaine on 3x is significantly harder than watching jason ku on 3x"
the intelligent investor is the classic	it's 640 pages longgggggg the cover looks like a textbook! ridiculous i think i need to give all hopes and aspirations to have anything to do with business ever again
lmao this is finance not business but ya that and security analysis are sort of the bibles of fundamental investing could recommend a more relevant book if u know if you're interested in like investing in companies on the stock market or something more quantitative or consulting or entrepreneurship cause they're all sort of specific skill sets like trading vs investing very very different in nature	any business career ever is still officially out no i don't know yet booo i'll let u know if i ever do
lmao i'll be here when u figure it out i think you should maybe brainstorm what you want in a job you know like quick stressful decision making every few minutes? lower stress environment? long term research projects? short term assignments? working with companies or with the markets? thinking about macroeconomic trends/ politics or ignoring them altogether? like nothing is gonna change to tell you what you want to do just depends on the characteristics of the job you want and the fields you're interested in life but i wish you good luck in this search!	lol what does this mean weell, yes that is the question isn't it
as in rn you don't know what subfield interests you most but i don't think you'll like read some books and figure it out, i think you have to think about what you look for in a job and use those qualifications to make an educated guess -- so you have all th information you need to figure it out is the point well ya but idk how much that changes	yeah i mean i don't expect it to be like an enlightening experience about what i want to do but rather i want to be more informed and have better context to make those decisions eh like u think people's tendencies towards certain characteristics in a job remain constant?
well i think whether you like working on projects for a long or short time and whether you like a high or low stress job is probably just a preference not something that will change and like whether politics or looking into individual companies is interesting or something more math-based and technical is also probably just a personal preference like there's just not enough time to actually try out all these different things realistically so you have to make some educated guesses right?	"yeah ig i feel like in general people will have tendencies but i always feel like ""you never know?"" in my head which is honestly just a rip"
well ya you do but that's what leaps of faith are for and if you hate it worst case you switch you're young you can always swithc	omg no i'm old i'm super old awful things these leaps of faith ok forget about me i'm just having another mid life crisis will solve by watching cooking asmr
love the spirit	how dare u heart my mid life crisis what's the word sadist wow i almost went for masochist thank god i didn't
uh i'll pass on either of those labels i'm just happy you acknowledged it we've all been thinking it for a while acceptance is the first step to recover	i acknowledged the crisis or your label? bc i feel like both of those were established
the crisis! excuse me the label is false	like i said established
LMAO SOMONE HEART REACTED TO MY Every four hours comment	STOP
That means there’s someone out there	PLEASE STOP
As crazy as you You guys should start a flossing club And just check in every four hours about how your flossing for the day is going	every time u say flossing claire does the backpack kid dance let's make that the club instead who was the heart react tho
Idk someone random guy Juan Carlos Ortiz?	lol what why
No clue	ok yeah no idk
He must really like flossing	eek also it's been snowing for like 4 days here in michigan everything is covered in snow rn
Bro that Sucks	like it looks legit like winter wait no it's so fun
Thank GOD I don’t live in Michigan	omg
For a lot of other reasons too To be fair So so many reasons	what did i do to deserve this
How do u feel about ur governor by the way Y’all have protests and shit Wild Lived in Michigan? Duh	Wait yeah they're fucking stupid Nobody gives a shit about hardware
Couldn’t agree more!	Lol Knew u would appreciate that
JIMMMMMMYYYYY so small	BRO why are u doing this to me
I’m not doing shit Just appreciating A small two inch size	can u not
Awwwwww	bro stop doing this to me
The shade	FFFF i'm turning my video off
Video does not look turned off	i am done w u blocked
w glasses!!	i blind
ok so what actually happens at 2:30 are we just taking over for them in the middle of the game also who's controlling the powerpoint	idk lol wouldn't dexin stay i'm not down to lead this
i don't get what we do if they're doing their little karaoke just like sit there and laugh? like it's just hard to interact in one big group call	Nah Wed probably have to do one
the slide deck only has four rounds tho	Oh Lol rip
Where is your face	I'm eating ramen lol I was washing the dishes while they were asking who wanted to present And my dad is yelling at my brother rn so I can't turn on my audio either
LMAO I just saw The caption on milos Instagram story Am I #3 or #1 Am dead The audacity of it all	;)) lowkey neither
Don’t tell him that	haha
You might offend the man	i promised him he was #1 forever
It’s ok he’s #1 in his heart	1/2*k*l_0^2 can u try that
Yeah sounds about right	for s3 first question it's review of 8.01 and u only get 2 tries and i just used one of them ok wait don't try that answer blindly can u try to solve it and confirm my ansser
Yessir	thanks bb
Gimme a second	i'm just doing this now because 8.02 keeps giving assignments and i am not here for it yo rip have u done it all already i thought it was at the farthest position tho these are arbitrary ass variables fuck this
no but someone sent most of the answers in a group	oh rip
haven't done any of the rest of it or like looked at attempted how do you feel about this 006 test	dude it's so stupid the situation given is different from the question i'm feeling aight about 006 just gonna bs my way through it i don't have the mental capacity to be concerned about it anymore
i like that they get shorter also if you look at like the curve from last year it's not bad i literally have not studied one minute tho so we'll see how this goes i just don't have the capacity to care	lol nicceee wait what is last year's curve? the morse nervous you are about these types of things tho the worse it usually goes so i'm tryna be nice and chill about it although i'm planning on not doing too much woork today because my mental thinking capacity drains too fast i wouldn't have any left by 7pm
67/90 is an A and 74/90 is 4.5 seems pretty good to me Lmao That’s a good reason to not to work for the day	ohhhh
I like the thinking	i couldn't remember what the numbers on top were so i was like 89/90 seems awfully high you like the thinking
OH hahahaha	i mean i think that means u can get like a question and a half completely wrong for a 4.5
Yes beautiful Plus it’s shorter We love that This time I feel like I’ll have	how much shorter tho what if it's just 90 min
A better time strategy	but same length
Well 90 points for 90 mins Instead of 120 points	oh lmao aight i mean fair enough
The only things I’d like Is On the last one the first few are like Not really questions Like you just find the polynomial time or whatever But I feel like here all the questions are real questions But idk I’m also like Completely Over It at this point	uh idk what this means but ye i agree
Like short answer versus full free response Like the first three questions of the first quiz were just Name the run time or fastest algorithm And the last few you Avtually construct a full solution But that’s all the questions here	oh f i actually got one of those wrong
Bro I’m tired of waiting I just wanna take ittttt	Hi Yeah same I'm ready to move on w my life
Exactly!	I have just like meetings all day tmrw So I need to just
I feel like I can’t do other things till it’s done But I want to	WAIT SAME
Meetings for what??	I'm not even studying
Jacob	Im just waiting
Hack?	Who's Jacob???  Yeah like thee hack meetings and 2 hours of OH It's gr8
I think I typed jaco instead of hack And it corrected	Mmmm
Oooooh	Ok
How’s OH going Still as much fun as ever!!	there were like 9 people persistently on the queue on monday
Ew	i didn't realize the lab was due tuesday
Tel them to not	i should've changed my OH this week
Lmfao	legit
What a dedicated tutor	i was exhausted by the end of it
Moving ur hours so you don’t help people Love that for you	"and i couldn't catch this one girl's error by the end of it i love it for me too so i had to trade with a uta but this uta is so passionate and good at 004 i realized after we came home that my OH almost aligns with his so then i shifted it slightly so it exactly aligns so now whenever idk smth i just ""hi miles, so i have this student with me who can't ...."" hopefully tmw everybody will be pooped out and nobody will be on the queue"
Lmfao	most of the time i just pull up my code and make kids do the same type that i usually do
Great attitude We love a healthy amount of leeching	not same type* like just fix their code so it matches mine
That would not work in 009	it's exactly the right amt if i say so myself lmao everybody's code is a shitshow in 009 there's generally a right approach or one of two
But like in an endearing way	if i get lucky their approach matches mine
Like yay shitsbkw time	oh now no definitely not
Bro they be having some wack labs this term	oh fr?
Like idk why they can’t just reuse them all Every term Would make things a lot easier	lol wait i was really lulcky most of the labs had similar implementations this sem for 004 so i was mostly doing copy pasting
Ideal coding	but on some of my labs i didn't solve it in the most efficient way
Oh sad	"so then like on the discussion questions it asks us to like say that ""using 2n vs n is less efficient"" when i used 2n rip and also on the very last lab one of the instructors changed the testing executable for the lab and it fucked up my whole lab and they were like yeah ""jamie wasn't supposed to use a register to store the results but she did"" and they had this long conversation about me in the slack that i didn't discover until later bc they were trying to come up with the right error message for me so then i had to go redo that part of my lab rip"
Wait lmao what I don’t get it Why were they Talking about you Like last term Or this term	like they make the test executables and then they run it on all of the TA and LA's submitted code on the server like test cases
OHHH	but mine was like crashing so they were looking for a good error message to give me
Love hat	and other people who also coded it the same way
It should’ve been like	which is absolutley ridiculous because mine totally works
Error: you’re a FOOL	why can't i use a register f :(( feel that
Warning: this is not a debuggable error U just gotta accept it and move on ^thats the whole error message	"lol wait literally that's like what ended up happening for another ta like he's the other uta and his code was also crashing in a similar but also ""incorrect"" way but they couldn't catch the action and provide an error message so they just passed the test on his and didn't on mine i was like bruh do me a favor here and just pass mine too"
LMAO Icons They’re out to get u And I don’t even blame them Would do the same	i have a strong dislike towards you
Yo Don’t like You love me It’s okay! Lean in Bro forty more minutes Is so long But I feel guilty like Explicitly wasting time before a test Like watching YouTube But also do not have the mental capacity to do work Ugh	eheeh i'm wasting time alex literally just sent me a yt video about 5 types of the happy birthday song
Isn’t there only one birthday song	like birthday soinig singers the quality of the singers and song melody hitting
Ah gotcha	we can start at 725 right as long as it's within 5 min of start time we can do it right
Lmao I guess	i just want to be done might fuck around and submit like 30 min lol
Lmao flex I be taking the full time	no flex just bore i'm so done with this already
Ugh me too I wish it was like You could start whenever Within a period	have u done the clinton swag thing yet yeah facts
Then I would been done	that's like 8.02 but i waited on 8.02
Ya exactly	since i don't actually learn that class
Well same but I wasn’t like Super done And ya I had to learn the material Bro we have any other test in like two weeks Low key I’m like not actually learning in my classes Not in a real way Just doing enough to like get psets and do tests but like	Facts This is a Real problem
I just cram the day before the test	All my learning is like Just enough to skim by
It’s a bullshit lifestyle	Seems to be unavoidable for most tho Like who at home is like yes Let me spend an extra two hours watching lec When I could search up a formula and plug and chug and ask my friend for the answer
Bro exactly Why would u watch lecture When you can search through lecture notes or google as you go Ugh I’m gonna have to figure out how to motivate myself If this is what the fall term is like	I would say just don't and let it be
Lmao Thanks You always give the best advice	No problem yo can u halp with s4 on 8.02 when u get there i'm at 2/3 tries again oof
which part	The angular frequency of the second q
that is	It has like I and q
the only par of the sequences i haven't done lmao	Omg
wait it has an I and q in it r u sure wait nvm i am confused cause i was doing some googling i am confused	the graph has I and q this questio
no i know but online the only things i saw were like from the first problem 1/sqrt(L*C)	oh yeah that's the only way ik how to solve it
only we do not know L or C	but idk how to derive those
how did you get 4/3 * pi	i wanted to guess 2*pi*1/2 actually since that was wrong but i looked at the graph and eyeballed the frequency lol but tai said that pi wasn't in the answer when he tested it out maybe it threw him an error
ok so it's not pi or 4/3 pi someone else tried 2 pi	nice we're slowly narrowing it down but yeah shouldn't angular be 2pi*f
yeah but how do u know f cause there are no units so i don't see how u can eyeball it	i assumed second and eyeballed lol like the period is just 1/f right
so you did 2pi/(3/2)	yes
does mA matter at all why did they tell us that it's 2 yeet	wtf how why
cause in video which i finally decided to watch having given up it says I_0 = w_0 * q_0 and i_0 = 2 and q_0 = 1 cause it's like the amplitude of the curve and shit	ok great why is this a thing
because that's how taking a derivative works/	ridiculous this makes absolutely no sense
yeah i mean it's chill it's over i don't care enough to think too deeply about it	wait i'm going to do the last 3 questions tmrw but it looks like there's very few tries plz help if i die
kk just text me sir	bless your good soul
have u done the last part of 2 for fps?	yesh it's just q_0^2/4c
wait wdym don't u need a time to solve for q	no it's saying when the energies are equal so 1/2LI^2 + 1/2q^2/c = 1/2q_0^2/c have u done the pset yet for 8.02 ^nvm we gucci here i'm struggling on the sequences now
oy are you awake i'm hoping yes have you done seq 3 i tried the first two answers but neither is right can you try the third or fourth answer and tell me which one it is because you know what there's some inconsistency here or i'm just really bad w directions	sned pic it's dependent on y so the direction of the wave wouldn't be in j it's 3
Oy Do you know anyone in ESG Per chance Like name wise	Uhmmmm I don't think I do
Ok so like Small favor No obligation to say yes But my pal emailed me back after A MONTH	lol nice
And asked me like questions about maseeh mostly but also was like I’m trying to be in ESG Do u know anyone who Considered / is in it Only I don’t know anyone who’s in it	i don't know much about the experience tho
But I do know someone who considered	also rip 006 yeah u can pass them along to me
Tbh I don’t think she’ll email you based on her not emailing me	just give them my email
But ya can I just give her ur email and say This girl thought about it Also how did u think 006 went?	sure kinda shitty ngl u sound like it went well tho since you're still a functioning human being i am not i know i did like the entirety of 2 wrong and i still haven't figured it out
wait sorry quick pause did u take AP lang and if so which year also idk i feel like i answered everything and felt good about my answers (but highboy was like racing against time to finish typing up last answer which was stressful) also like we should appreciate like my slow descent into not caring like first test i was all setup at the dining table, quiet testing environment etc cut to now when i'm taking it sitting in my bed chilling	11
because i simply cannot be bothered to go sit at a talbe	oh rip how'd u do 2
ok same was asking because i know someone taking it this year but they;'re confused about whether the score would come out before MIT's diagnostic thing	what diagnostic thing
because the registration for the diagnostic is before AP scores come out but the deadline for the test is after which is confusing if you didn't take AP lang	oh yeah but if you take it year 12
you have to take a writing diagnostic but i also took it 11	u have to risk it
wdym risk it can't u just register and then back out if you get a 5	they don't come out until like one of the last diagnostic exams
or are you not allowed to back out?	i figure u can but like there's a time window right so i'm saying if the results don't come out you have to take it then back out
ah ok gotcha	so it's effectively useless
that makes sense	also explain 2 sir
gracias i'm kind of afraid explaining it will make u tell me how it's wrong and i'll be sad but basically you can only use the stuff from a once but you can use the stuff from b as many times as you want so you can't put them all together so first i precomputed which values from 0 to m can be made using some combination of elements of B (repetition allowed)	ok wait this is like
so like x(m) is a T/F value and will be T if for any B_i x(m-B_i) is true so there are m subproblems	the crux of my problem
for each one you check n precomputed subproblems cause one for each element of B so that's O(mn) time and then once you have that you go to elements of A	wait ok i know a yeah but back to b
and yeah you just change the base case of A so when you hit the end you check the hash table you created out of B	so how'd u get this part cuz like the majority of my problem is that idk how to represent the any combination of elements in B
wait that's what i explained above	how'd u get the repetition alllowed then oh fuckk
you're not considering position at all	so the subproblem is always decreasing
just a sum value and then you keep subtracting	cuz of the sum fuck
one value B_i	i hate this fucking fuck
and check all n things you could subtract	i thought u couldn't do that cuz the subproblem wouldn't decrease f
oh ya u have to use that they're all positive so it always de decreases and then x(i) i<0 is false for your base case	yeah ok well rip i'm dumb dumb i can't believe i could have just added a repetition case and made my life better i was tryna do some dumb shit in the end
wait no not rip	that's probably gonna make them subtract points from my measy total
if you have the a part and just a mistake in the b part i think you'd get most credit so your total will not be measl y	i have the A part where u don't do repetition and try to get some sum between 0 and m thanks for the requote btw
yeah that's half of it  already	rip rippppp riperoni ripamantha riperanjalie riperamie
sorry what the fuck that's not a thing jamei omg new spelling of JAIME!! i don't think i've ever used that one ebfore but i like it i really like it JAMEIIIII	ok well let's please pray to teh 006 gods for good partial
wait no the solution write up is literally two	you've done this before
equally sized subproblems	jamei
so you'll 100% get full 50% credit for the A part plus a decent amount of partial	:')
for the B part which should be like	thanks for the support
near full credit for the whole problem	let's see if your prediction comes true
plus there's a curve and it's PNR so you'll be good i assure you	i just don't want it to be lower than last quiz rip
bro literally stop worrying ur def fine also historically scores for this quiz have been much better than previous quizzes which leads me to believe they're probably not that harsh w their grading as far as being like sticklers about little details	ehhhh well my og problem was kind of bullshit since it won't work but lilke ok i believe u i want to but like meh like the preface for my problem is a bit wrong because in my head i had this block that i couldn't use repetition to achieve B
wait high key	legit i should have just done it and fucked the topo sort
that's the problem w DP like you can be screwed by	cuz like in my head i thought of that like immediately at first but dismissed it
ur brain blocking out the method leading to the solution which is why timed DP tests are suboptimal just like why	thank you for understanding my pain
timed 009 where you have to debug doesn't make sense	also rip
because you can't train urself to debug in < 2 hrs not can u train ur self to see a solution some times these things just be taking time smh i have issues with CS exam formatting in high school sometimes we would have to WRITE code on tests	:// what can you do
also thought that didn't make sense	lol the fuck
in what context of the real world	wait same for ap cs a
will i need to hand write code wait even like 009 banning the internet like i get why but imo there is no time ever that i will be coding outside of school and can't google when i forget how to use a built in function simply no time ever anyway that was my rant of the day i think that was my last non-final test tho which is nice weird how fast this term went by	rip same we're in finals season now baby it's like getting hit with a sledgehammer like 20 times in succession they should allow access to python docs at least
how many finals do u have/ what format are they in	4 lol they're all 3 hour exams thank god at least 6.08 will be over soon
Ew!	how many u
Uh I have 4 3hr exams and one massive assignment/pset thing for 14.01 But I think 006 is the only one where there’s an assigned time to take it Which is kinda nice	oh the other ones don't? rip lol i thought institute policy was thata you have to take it on the day your'e assigned
well 8.02, 18.600, and 15.401 give you like  a 24-hour window i think? not actually positive haven't really been thinking about it much yeah i guess i mean like the assigned times are pretty back to back but w a 24 hours window i can take one in the morning and in the evening so then i have some space in between	Oh I thought 8.02 was not like that
I think they sent an email saying you can take it whenever within the 24 hour period	Oh oop I didn't see that
have you done 2c on fps am very confused	It requires very precise numbers dwai
wait wdym like i just don't get how you do it	It's the last part right Or second to last Wait can u send a pic Yeah don't worry about it answer checker is shit but Basically You see which absorptions in the main graph line up with the band's in h2o So it's like 2.75 and 6. Smth And then use the E = hc/lambda To calculate E
Oh ok that’s what I was doing So it was just the wrong estimation of where the band is That makes sense Gracias Jeremy	Yeah
Hi	Hi What's up
How’s life	I just did 036 today So Alright ig Wbu
sounds fun i haven't really been what's the word... studying that's the word am just busy with other things and also cannot be bothered but it's super chill	Lol what else r u busy with rn
gps stuff i had to make a DCF and do these readings	Ew
that shit took me forever also was doing some prep stuff for the summer just like as a rule anything that isn't studying for finals oh also i entered this stock pitch competition with emily and pam because emily was like you wanna so i was like sure but then i ended up having to spend a long time on it	Damn
so that was a lot of my week sad also have been making curriculum for bep is very time consuming but they're like be done early so when fracking admin announces it's online you guys will have time to change everything to work online and i'm like oh yes fantastic looking forward to finding out in july	OK so basically You're busier than ever F lol This is kind of ridiculous lol
nah i stopped learning am just surviving though my classes that frees up a lot of time	Nah that's just Smart
also did you write a message for ginnie *an article	No rip lol I've been just studying I should do it tho
for what ok what's ur staff position and title gonna be cause i thought about doing it but now i'm like i have nothing clever to say like yo happy birthday you're amazing and i'm too inadequate to be funny in this article because i didn't sleep enough last night, lots of love -Anjalie OH MY GOD i just realized pls don't tell me ur studying really hard for 006 because you're insistent that you get an A even tho there aren't internal grades and u made dumb mistakes on quiz 3 bc if that's what all this studying is about will kill you if it's 036 or something i forgive you a worthy pursuit knowledge is power and such but if it's 006 review that's unacceptable just search for your inner alex chen on the test	Lol what How r u so chill dude RN That's so crazy
wdym	Yeah no I haven't even thought about ginnies thing yet
the final in 006 has no new material	Idk im not even super hardcore studying for finals But You're like Even more chill I know it doesn't but it's not like ik anything
well every test is like a 2 hr test they're giving you three hours for	Trust me the amount I have to study is not the same as u
at least like 8.02 and 18.600 so it's easier to be chill cause it's not like i have to know things SUPER well just well enough to re derive or fumble my way through it cause there's less time pressure also that's not true	Well sometimes I can't even come up w the answer So that's the rip
idk finals where it's just review and no new material are nice because	The practice final was hard for me
i feel like over the course of the term the material becomes	I haven't finished looking at the answers
more solified in ur brain	But I got a lot wrong
so then you get things more	Wait that is not true I forget it right away Ok Let's not talk about this anymore Lol
the curve says you need a 98/180 for an A i believe in you my jimmy ok we don't have to tell me about something fun in ur life	Lol the curve is already posted?
no last year's curve but it's pretty similar every year i mean like it was 55% last year it's not gonna be 80% this year	Oh how have u been finding last year's curves Well My life is a cycle of sleepint And playing And like barely studying And youtube So I daresay you're being more productive than me
the cutoff has been higher last term than this term for every quiz  they sent us the wrong link after the first quiz that link had last year's curves	Oh nicee
and if u compare the third number is the A cutoff strictly decreasing SIR which is to say studying is good but freaking out is not warranted because at the very least just do the 98 points you feel most confident about	Lol
and you'll be good	OK fine well 8m still gonna study
ofc	I have nothing else I wanna do rn anhways
uh youtube	Not that I want to study
eating	Well Yes But
playing sleeping	I've been so chill
talking to me the most important person in your life	That I feel like life isn't real anymore
and also the most fun! bro i agree life isn't real	OK u don't get to say that you're the one that's been
it's all a simulation bro	MIA for like the past 3 days
wait no just the past 24 hours have been bad other than that i've been perfectly IA	LOL Agree tho
oh wait wait wait	My life has felt So weird
i was looking through my favorited pictures on my camera and i saw this	Am I in them
and i swear just laughed for a few minutes idk why	Oh no wait Wait
it's the funniest thing ever	No don't send it I'm good
it's not what u think also yes u are in them!	What if it is What I think Also 036 and 9.00 are both over
HAHAHAHA i just saw this an hour ago but it's still just as funny when i see it now HAHAHAHA	LOL
so good	wait ehat When did I come up with that comedy gold
i can just imagine you saying pahrnt august 6, 2018	Damn my humor has significantly decreased since then
a wHile ago	Holy That's so goid
i mean ultimately the takeaway is that you were brilliant	Damn we still have the cow emoji too
doing groundbreaking work making discoveries left and right	I'll think about more things like this now
bro we consistent	Again
yeet am ready for u to drop some more knowledge	When r u gonna Drop some bars
LMAO i think i retired	Did Vincent draw his pp himself
would do a comeback single w you tho anytime	Sorry just thought if this Down I've been listening to Very different genres of music these days
i don't think so i think it's some computer thing maybe aided by him or something no way he free handed it also I SAW u listening to YBN cordage lost boy the other day he's dating Naomi Osaka you know FUN FACT for you! he's the neehao to her jamie	It looked good tho Like Apple pencil drawing Wait yes I'm glad you've been stalking me I really like way back home and rnp WAIT WHAT
well it just appears on the side also YES for a while they're so cute	That's so crazy I didn't know that
they're both just like super chill and super good at what they do and he's super supportive it's so nice he goes to her matches and says pretty nice things in interviews	Did u know Lana condor is dating young captain jack sparrow Wow wholesome
i haven't watched pirates but i know	Is Osaka still like
who she's dating	Good rn
and what he looks like i mean yeah	I watched a my bf does my makeup video she did Like the first 10 minutes of it
still top 10 but no dominating the way she was oh shit is he cool	The women's tennis has not been popping recently afaik He's funnier than I expected lol
it really has not been bro sad also in very urgent depressing news ok wait are you sitting down	Yeah Why
u should be sitting down for this ok good	Is this like Tea about people we know Or tea Were u going to share it all Or just Leave me hanging
djokovic used to be my favorite athlete (that's right, across all sports) but i'm sad to announce he no longer holds that position ... so I know you're probably wondering - WHY ANJALIE?! WHY?... he's an anti vax-ers?!?! he said that if you have to get a COVID vaccine to play in tournaments around the world he would have to think about it because he doesn't believe in them and when he became gluten free because of the cult dude holding a loaf of bread and his hand and being like ur allergic i was like	Lolllll
yikes but i still love u but now after this after him saying this in public i'm life BRO i can;'t stand for this even tho i still love you it's so fucking sad	What What does this mean
boom you've been punk'd	I did not know he was an antivaxxer
like he was having trouble so he went to this cult leader dude who held his hand	U have a close relationship with djokovic I can accept this
and a loaf of rbead and was like i feel the bad vibes and was like ur gluten fre	UH WHAT
and novak (or as i now call him, no-vax) was like	Thats funny
seems legit	Some tennis players are really superstitious tho
yeah exactly	Not that it's good
so i was like	But It's severe
probably psychosomatic and it worked so i can accept it	His house is
but this is too much	Crazy fancg
this can fuck up the life of other people who follow him irresponsible	Yeah rip
becoming gluten free is harmless anyway it's ok i'm getting over it slowly but surely it is what it is guess your heart has to be broken a few times in life you know ?	Well U don't need to get over it It could be Just something that makes u Stop liking him
no i mean end of the day i still really like his playing style and personality so i still consider him a cool athlete i just don't like feel comfortable calling him my favorite cause that's a deal breaker for me	Lol OK
Oh Vincent replied	Fair
He traced it On a computer So art but not freehand Took a long time Also he says I should’ve reacted If u were so curious *u	Reacted?
Liked it I think he means	I thought I did lol I just thought of it lol
He said “wow she didn’t react to my post tho” Idk man I think he’s not angry just disappointed Kidding	Wow Glad to know I can add Vincent To my list of disappointed Bucket list check
Omg am I on it too!!	Been done Been been done
Hahahaha hahahaha Ur not wrong I’ll give u that	:oooo Wounded WOUNDED Are u on good terms with angel again
Lmao The first time I saw the picture I didn’t comment cause I was like I’m gonna get asked this question By then I got notifications and saw that Jianna and Claire commented and I was like fuck I’m not gonna be rude The answer is sort of It’s complicated We are speaking again If that answers ur question	Lol Ok I see
Jeremy! Happy birthday Idk if you get any legal rights being 19 But I’m proud of u for living this long bro Pls eat some cake or really any other baked good in celebration And enjoy our gifts once the 2-day waiting period is over hahahaha Am very glad u are alive P.S. pls say hi to babolat from me	LOL Thank u very much ily I'm losing rights By the day I made myself cake lol I'm so excited lol dude fucking breaking new s my mitpal responded to me the last time she sent me an email? april 18th what the fuck
Hi I need your recommendation Or like Ok so I’ve been using google calendar and it’s been great but not for tasks I need a task manager What’s the name of the thingy you were always using and/or have you heard of anything else good Cause I tried wunderlist which is now Microsoft to do but didn’t love it Also tried this target thingy idk it was bad Am now on the market for something else	"notion? that's thee one i use it's like sort of an alll in one workspace i've tried a lot of things yeah most of them don't really cut it for me cuz i just forget to check them apparently todoist is the ""best"" but i haven't tried it smth important for me was like it can't be on my phone because my phone is usually a distraction"
hmm ok i started using todoist wasn't big fan at first but now that i've gotten used to it it's not so bad i agree tho i never use my phone for this stuff	is it a desktop app too or just a website
Desktop app I wish the UI had a bit more color but it’s chill Also just got off the phone w your friend Jessica She’s cool (We have to do outreach calls to all get to know each other) We mostly just talked about how much we hate you Normal stuff Just kidding Only good things were said Obviously	Lol it's funny cuz I saw Jessica and I was like hey I know a Jessica That's fun
Also Reminds me We should have a froct call like Today or tomorrow I feel like if we try to plan it so everyone can be there It never happens So we should just like decide day or and do it and as many people as possible make it and it’s happy Rip the google calendar you once made Because it’s been at least a month And that makes me Sad	Lol really sad Yeah Let's decode sometime in down
Hi I tried commenting on your post but felt awakes Awkward But for the record I completely agree A million percent So thanks for posting it Cause said it in a very well written way and I appreciate that	thank you haha i was very nervous to post it
I think it’ll be universally well received I think you just said what most people are thinking Also question Do u know when applying to stuff When it asks for GPA whether we put 5.0 or not yet available or what	i'm putting 5.0 cuz like internal gpa exists so
Wait I thought it didn’t But ok that’s chill That’s preferable Wait what would you do During your leave of absence I didn’t know this was a thing Or I didn’t know you had decided on this for sure	yeah idk i'll just chill i probably won't get a job but it's like fine
Can you continue ur summer stuff I know some people are trying that Especially Start up people	uh he'd probably want me to be in school since i'm just remote uroping
Lmao a professor who encourages you to not go back Would be iconic	lol yeah idk about him
Do u think being basically remote but on campus Would be like Sufficiently different (Not in a disagreeing way I’m just not sure what to make of all of their suggested plans cause I don’t like any of them)	uh yeah no i was assuming there would be a certain # of on campus things still happening and it'd be slightly better i mean like none of it is ideal i could potentially take a whole gap year
God now I’m really anxious about them announcing Cause initially I was like whatever they do I kind of know my answer But after seeing some of the new proposals from that survey Idk anymore And it’s freaking me out a little	LOL what are your plans i'm kind of like whatever at this point i'll just be old in college
I mean like I want to be enrolled next year Under whatever circumstance Except	oh i see
lmao imagine being such an asshat it's okay he'll be far far away a whole ten minute bus ride on another note i'm dying like came home from graduation and immediately took a 4 hours phat nap but now that i'm awake feel even worse dying i think i got sick cause it started raining after prom and we were like walking to the bus in the rain for a few minutes	Oh my Well
or because i just have shitty luck so of course i'd be dying on my graduation	Congrats
where it by the way	Lmao
also drizzled was like 50 degrees	It thunderstormed yesterday during mine
but do we wear a cap and gown no we wear a short white dress so i fucking froze my balls off which was probably great for the sickness and have a meeting tomorrow at my lab that i can't like skip which is truly unfortunate point being in an ideal world i would sleep for the next like 12 hours and then pray to the health gods that i am better which will probably not happen but i know we already rescheduled our thing from last week so if there's anyway we could literally just move it to tomorrow night that would be v v useful but if you wanna get it done tonight i get it and i will power through like a #trooper	Nah Just Get better It's fine as long as we don't cut it too close If u have time tonight tho u can try filling out the form first and then we can compare tmrw night
ok sounds good also tomorrow will hopefully be better cause i'll be hopped up on cold medication to make it through meeting and as we know temporary fixes to problems are the best	Omfg Yeah Just lmk how it goes Your life I mean
yo finished filling it out lmk what time you wanna call and we can go over it	OK dope I'm good around 730
ok sounds good 	Ah give me 10 more min I just sat down to eat dinner Aight I'm ready
You missed a video chat with squishmallow thief. You missed a video chat with squishmallow thief. You missed a call from squishmallow thief.	squishmallow thief missed your call.
squishmallow thief called you. can you hear me?	ok wait i muted the site
cause I can hear you lmao	but it's not unmuting
uhhhh	You called squishmallow thief. The video chat ended.
LMAO the person who cry reacted to that comment is my friend who spends WAY too much time on facebook and therefore sees everything and like knows who you are cause i tag you on a semi-regular basis and likes to randomly react to things i've tagged other people in as a joke	WAIT I vaguely recall this guy from when you've tagged him now LMAO That's funny
LMAO Ya he once commented on my married status in person	Boi I'm tagging him
Cause I think I tagged you in soemthing And said wife Or made some joke	OMFG Wait is this the guy u went to prom w
No But this is like one of my closest guy friends Who is much cooler than the guy I went to prom with	Dammnnnn Don't do that do your date like that
(If u can’t tell I’m currently not the most pleased with that person) Ew don’t use that word	Uh oh BEEF
Omg Beef comes from a cow Just thought I’d let you know That’s why it’s bad Cause you you have to kill a cow	And that's why BEEF IS BAD not really it's delicious
HEY THATS CANNIBALISM WATCH URSELF	WOAH WIAH EIAH DID U JUST CALL ME A COW
Um yes Yes I did It’s better ur a cow who likes cows Than is human who likes cows Don’t u think	I feel both are equally Unappealing
well then... that's not very nice you gotta pick one buddy	"what isn't nice about it Bro it's like Asian black mirror
"
Wait wtf First of all That was so well produced But also They ending did not give me closure Rude I have a lotta questions bro wtf	IKR Kinda made me want to get back into black mirror tho OK idea What do u think of Moving the desks they give us to the center of the room to make one big table we both work out At* I've seen this before in dorms in shows So I wanna see if feasible also r u doing any advising or FPOPs cuz i was just thinking i'm not gunna
ok wait i'm so super down to move stuff around i was helping my friend move her stuff back to where it originally was cause she was moving out of her room last week the whole room completely changed it was so much better rearranged as far as the big table in the center sounds pretty cool if there's space in the center and stuff but regardless down for some desk manipulation and such for advising you kind of have to right like you can but the traditional no credit thing as your first choice but you have to put other choices too although i guess you probably get the traditional one if you ask for it i was going back and forth on that there are some that don't seem so bad but it also seems like a time commitment sooo idk I'm gonna apply for fpops tho people i know who did them seemed to like them although people who didn't also seemed fine just seems like a good way to make friends w people early on in a smaller setting so it's not just like here's 1000 people go cause you're in a group of like 50 or whatever and you hang out for a few days and like seems like a cool enough time i was talking to sophia (rachel's friend from garcia at cpw) and i know she's thinking of it too although tbh there aren't that many that i'm super interested in so idk i have to fill out that form v soon lol #superprepared and #ontopofmyshit clearly	"Lmao funny cuz I just saw they were due in like 5 days yesterday ok so i looked at some of the fpops and they're interesting but also like my parents already took the vacation days to travel up with me and my stuff on the 25th so i don't want to change their plans for that so i'm like kind of eh at this point cuz i don't really care about any of the ""discover ___"" ones about the advising thing tho what do u think of concourse is it worth what's the difference between an advising sem and a learning community"
ya that makes sense probably not worth it if you already have plans i saw concourse but isn't that taken in conjunction with some coutse supplements Becoming Human, our 12-unit fall humanities course is what it says seems like a cool topic but it's also 12-2 fridya i think when i checked firehose that was at a time that intersects with some classes that i potentially want to take a learning community is like a whole commitment right i think it determines which classes you can take and stuff and a lot of them are smaller and separate i know concourse is super humanities oriented but if that's what you're into i feel like it could be cool	I picked esg
hmm that's cool what made you choose esg?	Oh shat I didn5respond I thought it would be cool to take GIRs in smaller classes And easier to learn But also I just did an info session yesterday and now I'm not so sure Because u have to take two girs w them first sem And then another one at least second sem Also what fpop
I Oh sorry That was an accident But ya that makes sense Are you already signed up Or can you back out For me I agree the small classes are good But it was the limitation On what you take and when That was something to think about Also I’m doing the finance one Which was my first chkjce	Yeah I wanted to take 6.004 and 6.042 or smth first sem Was gonna save diff eq for later And chem as well Yeah u can drop it even if u get in R u doing an advising sem then
Ya I’m trying to push all girs to after All being three of them Cause they’ll still be pnr And then can lighten he old Load	Yeah is that chem bio physics or smth
I put four that I found that I liked and that met at times outside classes I think I wanna take And then my fifth choice Was traditional advising	There weren't times tho right
It was like	On the advising thing
Night skies, quantum computing, semantics, and systems thinking	Also idk how I'm supposed to pick course 6 stuff
On firehose there were times A lot of them were like	I just put the top two
Undetermined Which was sad	Wait my sem is undetermined too
Cause I kinda would want them but I wasn’t sure	My first choice
So I just didn’t put it in case	Oh I see
But my first choice was def the Astro one So it wasn’t like a huge factor	Ohh OK
But my friend said hat it doesn’t really matter Cause it usually works out anyways And that she didn’t even look at times really last year And it worked out well	Oh okay good Does it matter which course 6 stuff I pick first
Wait wdym Like which comp sci classes you wanna take first term Well there aren’t that many options right Useful to take ones that are pre reqs for future classes To open things up Do you know how many/ which classes you wanna take first term?	Yeah You're limited to 48 units and 9 elective credits right So Two course 6 one ci-h and physics 2 I was thinking But idk
Ya that makes sense I feel like that’s also a pretty common make up of classes for first term Like one gir one humanities and two major specific	Alright good I'm feeling good for our REST requirement it says it can be satisfied by 6.004 and 6.042 (but when taken as 18.062) but 18.062 would still contribute to my major requirements right cuz 6.042 is a major req but it's the same class as 18.062
bro i wasn't thinking and i swear to you i just typed jamey instead of jamie like not intentionally messing up that's just what my mind jumped to while distracted but also the answer to your question is yes i'm pretty sure because you can't take it twice so it should officially count as the same class on fb you said remind me to tell u a story later consider this an official request to hear said story presumably related to overthinking	Yeah so I got a job recently At this country club Coaching tennis But the problem is Country clubs are white as fuck And I don't understand the concept of leisure And real small talk Sometimes when I say something to another one of the coaches Who is closest to my age he'll be a sophomore in college next year He just won't say anything Back And I want to know Is that a normal thing Or does he just not know how to respond
LMAO	Or am I just not amusing
no I don’t think That’s a normal thing And I do think Thatyoure amusing That’s what we call	To be fair
A personal problem He’s just not lit	It doesn't just happen with him
And that’s on him	It's happened before in the past So then I gotta cross off what I just said In my list of acceptable phrases to say
Hmmm Well then maybe It’s a you thing Just a consideration	Lmaoo Seee I don't really know what it is tho Cuz he definitely doesn't dislike me I just don't understand how to talk to them I want u to see this What the hell is one of your parents an IIT alum
Wait isn’t that on your twitter I’m an avid follower I’d recognize it anywhere Ok I checked A shortened version is I actually think I use all of hose Maybe I picked it up from you Or I’m secretly a Midwesterner Who can really know Also both of my parents went to IIT that’s where they met But I’m assuming this is cause of that picture my mom posted In which she was referring to the three male people cause they were all in the same year and same dorm And she was in the year below	Yes it is Yeah you're secretly a Midwest hoe What the shit that's insane Also I like how y'all be family friending it up Meeting up w some casual iit buds
They were both in town like vacationing or dropping their kids off for some camp Ngl the one who stayed w us was a little arrogant He kept lecturing about politics I literally timed it There was a 20 minute period In which he talked And I said one word exactly. One. Word I was like bruh lemme respond But alas	Oiii I mean There always be people like tjat Still Crazy meetup Cool stuff Hope it was fun Listening to politics
Yo I have a question Are you going to HackMIT	I applied but they didn't get back to me yet I mean I can just dip day of so Nbd
I mean they accept all freshmen So you should be fine	Wbu
I’m gonna apply too Idk I have been to that many hackathons So I wasn’t sure	Neither have I lmao
But I guess if everyone goes it’s kinda worth it	But u get free shit all the time
Apparently there are a lot of sponsors Ya exactly	Worth it to try and learn smth here
Only 20% of mit people submit projects tho	I dot really have he capacity to do a project
Cause everyone goes for the free shit That’s why they’re changing the rules So now only freshman get in for sure And you have to apply otherwise	Lmao I didn't know thy changed he ules Rules
Ya this is the first freshman only year Cause other people submit w 90% rate Vs 20% So they’re tryna give people who are actually doing things a bigger opportunity	Mmm I see ok wanted to tell the you from 38 min ago that you're not an asshole
Omg We love a supportive spouse Except I feel like that album cover really represents me in a spiritual way I won’t lie	lmao yeah hope you're not feeling like an asshole anymore but you know it be like that sometimes i just can't believe that picture exists
Dude Housing decisions Come out so soon I think we should take this time To pray to the housing gods 	Oh shoot Not 5pm?
Wait I didn’t mean midnight I just meant in the next day Some early prayer I was looking for he thing That says the time But I couldn’t find it	Oh
So I just figured they would send the email when they’re feeling it	Yeah I feel like They should just do it at midnight I mean Why not Ya feel
Ya I feel like if it’s all setup And they already know Which I’m pretty sure it is It’s the least they could do I did more checking and they really don’t give a time which is just RuDe	yeah i checked the other day too i'm still finna check the portal at midnight we finna crash it even tho results aren't even out lmfao
Ya I feel like most people have strong enough preferences that they care a lot But like Rachel who’s thing is random Had it available And was like meh I’ll wait till I get home in a couple days to check Cause I can’t do anything w he information or learn about the dorm till then anyway And I thought that was wHaCk but then I realized it makes sense if you didn’t like see all the dorms and actually create a list of the ones you care about I also feel like it’ll either be like midnight, 8 am, or 5pm Those are the normal release times It’s so annoying when they just do it randomly during the day	Smh 6:28 pm coming at u Yeah if u don't really invest time into it Then it's like whatever I mean Not for me tho I still feel Cuz I'd want to see where everyone else was staying some people in the gc are saying 5pm others are saying 9am 5pm would be unfortunate prefer 9am
Dude true but the thing was that it wasn’t official they just fucked up so you could tell from your advisor so I feel like people weren’t talking about it as much Also either would be suboptimal But earlier better for sure	oh for harvard u mean?
Yeah	okay btw i didn't get into any of the advising sems i asked for wtf this was like weeks ago too i forgot to tell u and i decided to drop esg like not officially tho
Oh damn I’ve heard a couple of people who got that email	i probably should've let them know
Wait if you dropped it	oh whale
Which ones did you apply for LMAO Maybbeeee they would want to know	i put esg + advising sem then ranked four
Just a little bit Ohhh gotcha	yeah and then fat L it's alright i felt like
I feel like there are probably a smaller subset that are the most popular so you just have to get lucky	it's not crucial
But also most people I know were like it doesn’t matter at all whether you do one And they didn’t	and i'm fine with a traditional advisor so yeah
At least out of the sophomore people I know Plus less of a time commitment	yeah that's true
Which probably comes in handy first term	eh i'll ask when i schedule anyways yeah i mean the thing is i didn't get picked for esg in the first round lottery either so it kind of worked out cuz i wasn't gonna do it anymore but then u automatically get placed in the second round which i have no idea when it was or if it happened but like highkey
Ya probably more painful if you got in to tell them no	should email
Ya probs to be safe hahaha	but also how do i tell them i don't want to do it anymore i'm just lazy tbh
I mean just be like	to come up with nice words and perform the action
after further consideration I’ve decided I’m no longer interested in participating in a learning community And they’ll be chill	:p
Cause if it’s basically a litter Lottery	yeah
It’s like not too much extra work To take one name out	i actually did an info session earlier in june to enter the first round lottery
Oh damn	wait what r u doing again
I didn’t realize you have to commit And actually do things	yeah it was like this whole online video call lol it wasn't bad just one hour or smth
Doing for advising?	"yeah like someone from esg talks to u about it and stresses that ""we have no ghosts here"" and show u around and blah blah by ghosts like ""people who don't participate"" yeah but anyways what'd u end up doing for advising"
I don’t even really remember well but I know I picked four that I liked that didn’t clash and then somewhere in the middle of that ordering I put traditional advising I think fourth or fifth for traditional	oh like with your schedule?
But I didn’t get an email so I think I probably got one of the ones I put which makes sense cause I don’t think mine were like the super popular ones	right ok i see
Well roughly cause obviosuly I’m not sure of everything but I tried to guess and make it match up	ok welll ig the good thing is i can try to put a 9-unit elective instead of finding a 6-unit one firehose?
To be safe but apparently I heard it doesn’t really matter anyway cause they figure it out and it’s never really a problem That’s a good move And obviosuly works out super nice now	yeah maybe i'll start that business minor lmfao dude what if i just get into junior year and all of a sudden i'm like fuck cs and business and have no idea what to do that would be pretty bad i think about that a lot like what if i just didn't want to do it anymore what would i do ????
Yeah I think doing a minor would be a way to prevent that from happening And also just like taking some general classes and exploring People change majors kinda late So I’m sure you could figure it out Also I’m not sure about that	ok they trolled us it's not 12am
I’m guessing it comes out tomorrow	i'm fairly sure
But they’re saying like It’ll be there before Friday	blehhh
Meaning sometime on Thursday	now is thursday
Ya but like Maybe 9 or 5 or whatever Just definitely before Friday I’m guessing Also sad Cause I wanted to know before sleeping Now there’s more anticipation	ik oh whale
Who needs that	yeah why did we start talking about this
When did you start saying oh whale	now i have all this pent up anxiety like
Is this a new thing	idk not really i just like it
You’ve said it twice in ten minutes And never before	oh really?
I mean obviosuly it’s fire Just new	lol
So I have to get used to it	"every time i say it i think of that orca coming out of the ocean saying ""i came out of the ocean becasue you need to stop"" and that's my favorite meme or all time have u seen it"
Surprisingly yes I feel like I’m never hip with the kids But this time I get it Actually I just never get vine references	yeah i was never on vine
Oh shit	yeah it was 5pm
That’s a long ass wait 17 hours	that was on my housing application i clicked into
How will I love Live	17 hours is a long ass time you're right
What r they doing It’s def already in the system How hard would it be to just like Tell me Smh	comedy gold
Wait THE SECOND ONE IS SO GOOD IM DEAD tumblr users are lowkey brilliant I won’t lie that might be he most underrated platform Or maybe it’s not but I just see like the best examples from screenshots on Instagram	lol tumblr is so good did u get a confirmation email for ase registration cuz i didn't
Dude 15 minutes Also I haven’t submitted yet (for literally no reason cause I know but actually saying it makes me stressed anyway) but I’ll lyk when I know Probably fine thot plus you have time if something was wonky	lmao why not
I don’t know I just wanna fee done studying and then I’ll do it and it’ll reduce my anxiety Also did you see the person in the chat Who said they took macgregor so their prents could stay with them thru orientation And then they’ll try to REX into a different dorm That’s bold But also I feel like there’s no guarantee you don’t get stuck in macgregor But I guess it’s smart if you don’t want to pay for a hotel and want a guaranteed ish single (assuming they get their first choice)	whattt also trolled wtf
Yeah wtf They said 5pm	this is messed up how could they betray my trust like that if you ended up in macgregor all year tho damn
Dude exactly I feel like it’s not worth it Unless you already like macgregor a little And like want a single	if that was like your second choice or even third maybe i'd understand but like
But I don’t think this person does	boi
So ummmm	that's familial love
Phat phacts	ok so apparently est and edt are two different things but that makes no fucking sense
Wait are they tho Cause that’s just something that changes w daylight savings But I don’t see why they would use the wrong one I think they’re probably just late In the chat they’re saying they were late by an hour last year So maybe that’s what it is again I just hope it’s not tomorrow Cause that’s such a longggg wait	uhhhhhh they're already loaded so can they just open it
DUDE EXACTLY maybe in order to ensure it's not early they like press ublish at 5 and it takes time to laod actaully it shouldn't it's not like that many people literally a 1000 i don't even think you'd really overload a website it's not like decisions coming out or anbything this should not be so hard to coordinater i feel like?	Smh The whole gc is revolting too lmfao
as they should bro it's been 2 hours the heck	Ik This is just Disappointing I Have anxiety
dude SAME but also i'm suing what is this bs	Expanded : Dude I feel similarly Additionally Find me a lawyer so I may take them to court What utter nonsense Expanded further: Bull Shit
wow thnk you for that expansion i feel like i better understand my own words truly informtive particuarlry the expanded further section	Mmmm See We UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER
DUDE I KEEP REFRESHING hoping for something like every 10 minutes and i think i might just give up but yes we speak the same langauge that tends to happen after 20 years of marriage	ME TOO WHY ARE WE THE SAME i think i'll have to give up to i am going swimming in like 10
wait i wanna go swimming lemme catch a flight	not that i like swimming
pull up to novi	a lot but 100 yards yanno
it's so hot rn i'll take a frickin pool	it's nb here actually
anyday wati what	have u seen that
more of a reason to come to bumblefuck	what if...jk...unless meme
YES fire format	what if they came out at 7 jk unless....????
i saw one that was like what if we sit next to each other on the bus back from the science olympiad on SAT we stan	LMFAOOOOO
dude that joke hit too close to home #tooreal	i know i am going to be pressing refresh u ever wonder like they totally have the capcity to relelase them now but they enjoy seeing their page activity go up
tbh maybe	and what if the fbi is watching us refresh
they probably have a plant in the group like amused	and both are probably
as we all flounder and are depressed	just sitting in the chairs cackling FLOUNDER
but also i feel like the vein of work smart not hard would just be to turn on notifications from the chat which i currently mute and then wait till i hear a bunch of buzzing from people talking when it comes out but of course i'd rather sit here and refresh my self every few minutes like a fool	ok trolled for the 3rd time 1302092up30492th time ok but to be fair they tlak a lot in the chat
they really do	and it's not worth to watch the attempts at humor and making friends
i can't handle it	which is nice but
well also like	to be fair takes a lot of texting
i think it's 100x less efficient than in person	right so
like joking w someone in a 500 person gc does not really build a friendship also they said they were only an hour late last year so what are these shenanigans	so this is just cruelty on another level
TWO HOURS AND NOTHING r u joking we should revolt	how tho this is injustice
oh wait on facebook it says that someone emailed them and they said	yeah and evening
"""later this evening"""	they said
how very specific	THIS IS FUCKING EVENING
and useful	they emailed them that at like 5 ish something too
and not at all the information that we already had	so this is EVENING
that it would be before tomorrow i'm so done	yeah like it's no problem
the problem is that i don't have a pool	i'll just die here
i just want something to do for a couple hours and hten i come back and it's there and it;'s something where i have no access to my phone so there's nothing i can do about it actually idk if that's ideal cause i also want to know like immediately when it comes out but anything is better than this	yeah see me too
you gotta get like a ziploc bag so you can take ur phonein the pool and check as you swim	Here I waz
We’re now closer to 12 than 5 smh	Hoping the results would be out After swimming But mooo
 MOOOOO	I actually caught the error Before I sent it But I was like hey Moo Alright thots This is evening For sure
Unless Maybe it’s not Cause apparently they have no respect for the rules	Snh Academic Institution My ass
dude i was away from my computer for like a few minutes and then i got to my phone and checked and saw messages from you and my heart literally jumped cause i was like oh shit maybe they posted but alas they're still lmae smh	LOLLL sorry
i'll forgive you coming upon 4 hours tho and i simply cannot	T.T
i feel like the question now is just does it come out today at all	This is a scam
PHACT	ThEM Hoes
MASEEEEH	YAKWTFGOOOOO YESSSSSSS are we on floor 6 tho isn't it dead
ya idk anything about the 6th floor is it dead?	6052 right that's what the kids in there said but that's alright we're lit people we'll make it lit
i'm guessing that you choose floors based on seniority	i heard the 5th floor is wholesome oh that makes sense
so makes sense that freshman would get 6 but we can just hang out on 5	dude who cares
or we can make it fun	MASEEEH
i feel like floor culture would chagne every eyar but yeah	agree
MASEEEEH tbh all i cared about	MASEEEEEEH
was the dorm	ik thank the housing lords 6052 right
yup	ok good confirmation
dude i'm so happy maseeh also has the squatting thing so if we like 6052 we can be guarenteed to keep it	what's squatting ohhhh like forever???? well u know what i mean
like for the year	broooooo
cause in some dorms	tooo good
the room you get in orientation might go away	ohhhh
but here if it's big we stay and if it's not we can try for a better room	wdym go away
"hi are you on your laptop right now if so can you download a csv of the users on my.hackmit.org (from admin account) and then use this code to get a list of confirmed users:

import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv(""export_quill_users_2-8-2020_12-50-57_AM"")
df[df[""status.confirmed""]].email.to_csv(""emails.csv"") my pandas isn't working :(("	Hey amna  I'm at tennis rn
oh wild ok i will ask someone else have fun!	OK sg sorry
no worries!	anna do u know where hack 19 pics are
o I think they should be on the hack fb page except theyre really dark for some reason	oh okiee huh weird do u know where the team pic is stored
oh hmm no sorry im not sure where that is jack might have them? or actually I might have them on my phone	wowow thanks anna
np! hope you got home safely (or made it to the hack house safely if you're doing that haha)	ahah i am not doing hack house but i hope u did toooo anna i heard hannah said you'd be in charge of beginner workshops with savannah just want to confirm also will u be at beginner meeting tn
yeah if beginner workshops are during hackweek then we're helping organize! yee I'll go to beginner meeting	alright cool not sure if they will be but that'd be gr8 hey anna did u want feedback from team on the proposed mini events i can't remember from last logs meeting i'll toss it on the agenda if ye
Oh yeah that would be great, I guess we got some feedback from logs people but it would be even better to get feedback from the whole team!	ok sure if u want u can toss in some of proposed events on go/nm under swag options + budget changes idk why i put it there but like it's fine
oh nice! I'll put you down in the experimenters for now then we'll have to find a good time to formally divide our group up and talk about this oh right right SVM might be a good idea as well I'll put it in the spreadsheet	yeah lol 10:30pm on friday :(( unfortunately not a good time for me but i'm glad to finally be starting to work fulltime btw did u hear back from urop office about funding yet
it's still review: holding for me :(( we def need a better time tbh idk where 10:30pm came from lmao	eek :(( i'm in admin review i9f yours is in holding there might be something else u need to fill out
wait is that before or after	i thought after but maybe not i'll email urop about it
it's been in holding for like 3 weeks now and nobody's said anything rip	anyways go get some sleep lol yeah same
I was gonna give it some more time but ig I might email them too alright gn wait no have a great day lmao your day just started XD	lol thanks ARUN IM SO SORRY I MISSED THE MEEGING I slept at like 5am last night and slept through both my alarms I saw your slack message I'm going to start working on the nn today
ahaha it's fine it's fine okay nice! I will broadcast the message during the all-team meeting as well	Specifically I saw a LSTM neural net tutorial that I'd like to try Formatting the data might be difficult but I'm going to give it a shot It's a recurrent neural network I saw you or someone else is trying tf idf with nn Who was that again
wait just to be clear you'd be working on LSTM RNN? or would it be just a deep NN / dense NN	Yes I want to try this
this one was me but I haven't actually started lol	It's not really deep or dense per se It's like a model that preserves state and processes words temporally We haven't talked about it before
it's that thing with W and S and X in 6.036 right lmao	I saw other dense feed forward networks too but haven't found a concrete model yet Ah Yeah When u move on to nn for tfidf we should talk So we can both find a good model To implement
yeah I was first thinking of like a general deep/dense neural network (not sure if that's what Max had in mind) but we can find a good one to implement as well so that we don't waste time implementing a not-so-good model	oh i see like any neural network that performs some classification task is a valid option but thinking just like intuitively i have a hard time imagining how to format the dat
he said we format it using the existing tf-idf *we could do we wanna set up a meeting XD	yeah i'm down oh interesting i was doing some research the other day that said other forms of representation might be better at capturing context cuz like tf idf is just ratios with bag of words right
yeah honestly tf-idf is not the best but it's something (and quick) lol what if we have a three-way meeting with Max Friday morning? what a concept oh I think Haimoshri is coding up LSTM soon as well?	Haha interesting Oh really Maybe we should try to take different approaches tho Have u talked to her about it recently since She just got back hi arun not sure if you're still up quick question are u running the article classifier on nyt corpus data
Max just suggested that we could implement an RNN _as_ a article embedding mechanism which would technically be different from LSTM? she just said half an hour ago that she wants to code an LSTM *will try to code an LSTM	so the way it works is that ther'es an embedding layer which learns the embeddings
yes for this one	and then there's an lstm layer oh huh uhhhh what should we do about this then
uhh idk lol	ok great is there like some preprocessing code in your euler folder i just want to take a look when i format the data haha ok i'll text her about it
not quite because I've been relying on sklearn to do the preprocessing and tf-idf transformation but it's a prepackaged method already in general in a row within nytcorpus.p I only use row[2], the article text and row[3:], the tags idk if I answered your question my brain has stopped working	oh i see is so you're using row[2] as the article text and the tf-idf transformation right on top of that article text right is the tf-idf code until arun omg haha yeah go to sleep let's talk late i'm usually up really late that i sometimes see u on the spreadsheet when I'm working on it HAHA so if you're up tmrw morning we can talk then
wait what  oh ya ya definitely	"under ""ARUN"" sorry haha ya oik go to sleep"
yep my main code is ARUN/Project-C/Naive_Bayes/nb.py might be a bit spaghetti and disappointing because I used sklearn for most of it lmao	LOL no worries i'll take a look i'm sure it's great
I am back to life	LOL Oh no I went to bed early for once
lmao nice	It's life changing haha
I'm just reading up Keras for now	Ahah OK cool Yeah I played around with the corpus data yesterday And the news folder tsvs And I realized that the corpus data is really messy Like the company report articles are all like Random numbers + like 10 words
yeah they are... not the best lol	Are we sure the labels are correct too cuz some things don't have labels
I'm assuming they are? tbh I haven't really looked into what kind of articles don't have a tag I just knew some don't	Lol yeah I'll look into it further since max said there might be some problems with it I think we should put our articles in the NEWS directory on mturk for users to classify on bias/lean Then there's also an option for them to highlight the sections of the newspaper that are biased Idk if this is a good idea tho since the articles will have political statements that will bias judgement I'm just not sure how useful classifying an article by topic is since that doesn't reveal bias I'm still working on processing the data into something cleaner but Idk
this is quite a nice idea and I think we might be doing that later on maybe as part of another project/the project at large if I'm not mistaken? classifying by topic is kinda groundwork for other projects ig like at least improvethenews would work better and other projects can narrow down by topic and did so it won't necessarily reveal bias make sure your make a copy lol btw I think that NYT corpus is like a commonly used dataset so not like Max made it himself	ah i see cool oh i sde but one thing i noticedd the topics from the corpus seem very random to me
yes they are 	like so it makes me wonder
idk who came up with these labels	even if we did classify it based on these topics how would they be incorporated into improvethenews like i'm sure google news can do infinitely times better than us at this task also i thought of a problem definition we want to try when we move over to classifying bias say we have some scale 1 to 5 we will pull articles / (potentially specific sentences not sure yet) and ask mturk users to rate them based on how left leaning or right leaning they think they are and then we normalize those values between 0 and 1 the average value collected mb then those become hte ground truth labels for trianing and now we have some way to quantify bias kind of like the attractiveness classifier
that's kinda the idea of project U is it? or close at least	haha yeah ive got soem stuff in my direc oh really? i thought they were using some mathematical models to map relations between different sources rather than an absolute classification i'm just thinking of this in terms of ML model definition yeah but the pickle file definitely feels preprocessed i emailed him asking if i could look at the raw data tho cuz some of the words aren't tokenizable cuz they have no spaces in between them???? like what
oh yeah I noticed that too this is... kinda true but he thinks it's possible for us to make a state of the art news topics classifier? It's a stretch imo	lol yeah that's why i suggested we shift focus to something more novel perhaps and like google probably can tell what kind of news we like to read too like on google news you'll get info on topics you like before read* and you'll get sources from leans that you prefer it's funny cuz these days i look at a bunch of right leaning stuff for daily homework and i'm signed in on chrome so google news thinks i'm turning republican
lmao yeah ig we're not trying to top Google news but offer a different service with our website	right
yeah agree we'll need to shift our focus in the coming weeks maybe	but the tasks we're asking mturk users to label might be too difficult like we ourselves don't even know how to classify nuance and depth that well we each have our own scales
yeah I think project U's long term goal is to address that? like from ratings calculate user bias and news bias	oh i see interesting we'll try to incoporate it then with some ML stuff yay hey arun quick update i ran my LSTM code on the NYT corpus (not all of it, about 1/1000th of the data to make it quicker) here's my stats: Train - FP: 8.286864477142755e-05 - FN: 0.7107939762355381 this is only from the training set i didn't build a test set yet cuz the data is very i'm training on the full thing rn lol i forgot to split it so that's fine it's taking forever 2m data points is a lot FP rounds to basically 0 that's what the e-5 is
fp is so low... interesting or are you using a different scoring method	FP/(FP + TN) right I think it makes sense Neural nets tend to reduce loss in the easiest ways it can So because the 1 labels are sparse
Max did it a bit differently	It is biased towards labeling 0 and will often not make a mistake of accidentally labeling something as 1
he averages over the number of data points counting labels in pred not in true and vice versa it's a bit strange	Wait whats the formula Wdym by averages over And counting not in true
so for each datapoint you look at the predicted labels and true labels (not the binary matrix) count the number of labels in true not in pred (fn) and the number of labels of labels in pred not in true (fp) sum it all up for all datapoints and divide by the number of datapoints see compareTags.py and uh mat2tags.py in my folder	Aren't those rates tho Like the number of labels in pred in true
those are rates ya it's just how Max does his scoring ¯\_()_/¯	I don't see how dividing it by the number of data points could give u anything below 1 as a rate tho Say I label 2 things false positive in my first data ooint If that is my only data ooint Then my false positive rate is 2 Do u mean 2/593 Because if that's the case then the formula is the same Otherwise I don't see how that metric makes much sense
it's 2 yeah according to this metric	Uhhh how r u getting such nice rates on the datasets then I feel like Something is off here Unless they do really well Idk I just feel like the metric should account for
it's not really nice it's like 1/3 2/3	That means like on average you predict less than 1 wrong per data point then Per article or whatever I feel like that's really good and not
I can try looking into the output again I'm scared now lol	LOL Maybe u are doing rates
greatest fear in life	It definitely feels like rate HAHA Wait yeah
reporting better scores	Manipulate output to say 100% Ez Machine learning done
my model is 110% correct	LOL Yes
oh wait he likes rate per tag	Absolutely
which makes less sense	:o Am confusion
but it's like after that whole shenanigan he divides by 2.4 something	:ooooo Now I am incredibly lost What metric is this
"I look at this and see ""o no results not gud let's divide everything by 14369352 so it's closer to 0"" don't tell him that tho lmao"	LOLLLLLL Holy You're so right Haha I would never
as long as we use the same metric I think it's fine?	Hmm OK I'll look at your files later Maybe I can ask him tmrw in meetinf I just prefer my performance measures while testing Because I think it gives me a better idea of what's going on
yeah I think you can just save true and pred into csv and run my tool codes afterwards	Oh has to be into CSV? The corpus is huge tho I haven't even gotten through the first epoch of my code with the full dataset And it's been running since this morning smfh
I just wrote it for csv you can save as pickle I'll just write another method lol oh rip	Haha is there a description of this metric anywhere Ljke Did u write the functions after asking him Or does he have like original version / spec I can also look at yours and rewrite to fit my coee
I just looked at his code and was like uhh you do you I already wrote some methods so if that's at least a bit helpful you don't have to reinvent the wheel	Aye OK yeah maybe I'll just modify the csv upload part then
there's also loadcsv and savecsv in my nb.py if that helps also I should've just picked them lol oops big memory	Aha wdym  picked
*pickled	Ohhh It's no problem lol It's def easier in CSV and more accessible idk what this per article calculation is doing but ntags may make sense? I'm really not sure it seems strange correct is more like TP + TN + FN and idk how he's doing the not in and in it's very strange
wait it should be TP + TN?	oh wait no it's just TP correct says if i'm in pred and i'm in gt then i count for TP right and then they add fN so it's TP + FN
wait what	because the calculation for correct is if i'm in tag1 and i'm also in tag2 then it's += 1 but otherwise it doesn't count and the only way that's possible is if it's true positive
mmhmm	i definitely think there's some error in the false positive calculation tho FP/FP+TN so that seems exactly backward
is correct + falseNeg = number of total tags in true?	it's not the number of total tagas it's the number of acutal positives and FP + TN is thte total number of actual negatives
yeah no he's not doing the typical FP/FN for sure	rip
it's like a strange FP rate thing	yeah i'm not sure he missed my email from last week asking him about the corpus i'll probably bump him if we don't get to it today
you might just have to bump him lol	yeah lol
did he just call me Colin	LMFAO he really did that to u :((
triggered lmao I feel ya	 oh also i think haimo and i may be running very similar models my loss function is slightly different but it's also an LSTM essentially my data processing may also be slightly different
yeah that's what I'm noticing as well	haha yeah i thought haimo would run it off of finn's word embeddings but idk anymore
her code is on github if you wanna take a peek	oh yeah i was talkinga bout it with her over the weekend  very similar to this tutorial
oh okay okay	we must have been following the same thing haha
oh lmao	anyways it's fine when we change gears we'll have to think about different models and refining this one because this one is really simple and doesn't process the data that well
this meeting with Jasmin didn't turn out the same way I thought it would lol yeah definitely	lol yeah wait what is the subject topipc of this meeting again
discussing her paper lol	oh rip yeah idk maybe max is just warming up
like the model (at least for me)	yeah same lol
I feel bad for her that like 20 minutes of her meeting has been uhh random stuff	I KNOW LOL i think she just wanted to explain her model and be over with it
and her initial meeting length is 30 minutes	:((((((((( LOL
lmao Max just realized	she has something at 1:30
he's like ohh.hhh..h.h	u and i are on the same wavelength LOL
...is it the same benchmark?	wait what also he keeps callilng on me and jianna he means emily right LOL
Max was talking about how we are using the same benchmark as her	oh man
I don't know who he's referring to anymore it could be any one of the 10 of us	LOL arun = colin jamie = emily = jianna who else have we missed that's wild LOL what is going on we should directly ask jasmin about her benchmark then to at least understand the math
you know what I guess I'll read her code later lmao	oh good idea is her repo somewhere
yeah github I'll hunt for it	savior arun
yes I do know how these things work lol	shade him arun let's just look through the repo later and email her if we have any questions do you understand what the CNNs are doing
somewhat but I'm not really following the dimension path	yeah same
what the heck he never confuses me with Colin before today	LOL yeah i think he's just throwing out names at this point
is it just me or do you think Emily likes dragging meetings lol	OMG YOURE SO RIGHT i'm so glad i'm not the only one that thinks this
YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN ME IN THE LAST MEETING (that you missed)	LOOLLLLLLL RIP
Emily was like dwelling into what neural networks are	you should take a smalll nap dude just go to max's tutorial
and I was like I'm meeting to steer a boat	LOL ikr your boat is being dragged in 3 different directions rn are u still planning with colin or he is MIA
he has been MIA but he made the framework for the directions	ah i see i think we need to do a better job of assigning tasks everybody seems to be not sure of what is going on
THAT'S WHAT THE MEETING WAS FOR LMAO Imma call another meeting soon ish	LOL RIP WHAT IS GOING ON also literally i got dragged into doing RUM it's fine but i feel like it's just gonna be data processing
what is RUM again?	it's max's friend's RNN model lol
oh I missed the part where Sam was talking about doing something and passing it to Emily later? this is my summary of the state of the union so far	Oh that's good Sam is going to build the word embeddings Using BERT then have jianna and Emily learn how to apply it I think using a fully connected nn
ah okay	I've got a sigmoid layer in my rnn model after the linear layer if that helps
I'll make it past-present-future	Yeah also for next steps I felt like max suggested that we classify news based on stance on certain topic In not really sure tho I want our work to be significant And actually not be something self evident Idk What he means
mmhmm	Like I think stance is a really good idea but Do we have ground truth data for that Or are we relying on our own manual might OK don't think about this now Go to bed
okay updated will go to bed	Gn haha
working in a big team is highkey stressful lol	T.T it be like that I totally feel
tor doesn't have much memory or any gpus right I've been trying to run Haimoshri's code for days and it keeps running out of memory or killed for unexplained reasons	It doesn't have any GPUs The data is too large to just be run on a cpu U might want to ask her to just run it herself since she has access to GPUs
wait what and why did she ask me to run it for her lmao	Not toe Dude idk I think she just wanted to write the code And have the manual task of running it done by somebody else
hmmmm have you gotten any results btw?	i'll check i doubt it tho
are you running it on tor?	on matlaber media lab machines my old docker container from my last urop
ah smart tor is the only one I can run on lmao	:(( we should ask max to buy us some GPUs i made it to epoch 4 just checked my accuracy is going down rip
oh rip	yeah maybe it's just working hard or getting confused
what the hell this is day 2 of him mixing me with Colin how is this happening	LOL idk the more he looks at us
oop also Colin's name is nowhere in the Sot(C)U	LOLLL damn u really did that to hi i mean
wait but like he hasn't claimed anything	yeah idk i feel like if he wants to do something he'll claim it
also I'm not just insane for not understanding his question earlier right	what was his question about the saving the internal layer? or something else
like... bag of words? nvm if he has a question he'll just message me ig just hoping he doesn't kill me for dominating the co-project coordinator title lmao	lol i really don't think he's trying to take on more work uhhhh yeah no clue my update for today is epoch 8/20 training loss just started going back down let's hope it keeps going down but if u want u can share my results fro my smaller run and ask about the performance metrics not srue
sure	cuz my metrics might not match how ya'll calculating
I used Max's compareTags / my own equivalent code	yeah i just want to clarify what his comparetags metrics mean
I can tell what it means but I don't know the inspiration or if it's the accepted metric lmao	right that's what i mean yeah like i want to understand why he's doing what he's doing
I should record data on how long each project presents	LOL we'll see if there's statistical significance
okay I probably won't join the RUM meeting lmk about it! I need s l e e p	haha ok have a good night
dang she really is making me run all her models lol	Wait yeah I saw her slack message I have no idea why she wants u to do that Itd be way faster for her to just do it U should just text her and be like
idk if she doesn't know how to do it or she just doesn't want to	I have to manage project c and run my own models She definitely knows how Cuz I was talking to her about it earlier tosay And tell her it'd be faster if she ran her own code and then u could work in parallel Just be upfront about it and hopefully that'll work
okay yeah I'll try	Good luck haha you got this
I don't have much experience doing this tho lol	Do u mean rejecting people LOL
yes lmaooo	It's cause you're too nice Hey there being nice is usually a good thing Just not TOO nice lol
okay okay I'll see what I can do maybe she thinks me being on the other side of the world means I can run while she's sleeping? idk	Haha don't get stuck in this loop in your head First tell her you can't run them due to your own project constraints And then see what she says before u get ahead of yourseld
mmhmm oh it's almost as if she wants her name on as many models as possible without doing the actual running 🤔 do you happen to know about nn.MultiLabelMarginLoss? Haimoshri used it in her code and I'm pretty sure it's not a good loss (or not what she thinks it is) I talked to her and it seems it's the first case where she doesn't know how to run it which is strange	She was running it before tho She's just annoyed that the computer closes her session after a while It's essentially BCE loss I think but not as good I looked it up before
oh isn't that MultiLabel*Soft*MarginLoss? confusing names	Ah yes That is
ah okay I've been training Haimoshri's LSTM model for the whole day today	Damn how's it going
slow lmao	Eek rip
dw during that time I did other things too	haha ok ok good um also i'm not really sure but my model error keeps going up and accuracy keeps going down which is a rip
it might have started to overfit? can you stop there or something lol	no like it's getting higher error on the training set like how is that even possible
uh interesting	yeah and like presumably the training is updating the weights? does loss usually go up before going down when it tires to update as far as i know i've never seen this before
not that I know of either	i'm going to stop it :(( so sad it's been working so hard for the past 4 days
I feel that it's always so sad when you run it for a long time and see some bad results / bugs	yeah lol :((
oh shoot should've timed the meeting lengths HAHAHAHA	U MISSED CRITICAL DATA POINTS
Emily and Max make a good podcast	OMG arun you come up with the funniest things
ahahaha tyty	i'm going to send an email to max around 2 about the GPU and performance measure questions we have so hopefully he responds with some good stuff
that'd be great he promised to answer questions about gpu soon	oh ok great
not great since he didn't answer lol	Damn Hopefully he responds to my email sometime tmrw
okay Haimoshri is learning how to run at least she knows the struggle of running now lol	Haha yesssss It's soooo time consuming
otherwise she'd be nagging me and saying like is there any updates	Ikr
I can't believe she didn't know how to >> log.txt &	LOL rip i've been using tmux to extend my sessions
:0 I don't know anything about tmux lol	We don't have it on tor so it's a bit unfortunate But whatever
this training thing is a national emergency	LOL dude it really is the good news is that my training loss is now going down instead of up
ah nice should we just save the models every epoch as a backup in case validation / training loss goes up or memory runs out	yeah that's what i've been doing except my models kinda shit rn so it's like not even worth lol plus every epoch is like 6 hours so i'm not saving a new one tho i'm overwriting it which in hindsight is not great but also it's too late i started execution it's been running for a day i'm nover it
that's what I've not been doing oops that's okay I'm overwriting stuff all the time lol	:((( sad reac
I have less saved models than there are datapoints on the graph lmao	LOOLLL thank god for your graph then
in hindsight that's probably not a good idea that I keep overwriting lol	oop
lmao he has selective replying he replied to my email first even though it's sent after yours	f ik he responded to mine finally but not satisfactory answer i replied all with my response, take a look if you're interested wait am i trippin or does c + fn = tp + fn just need to clarify my sanity she is beauty she is grace my training loss is going down baby
no? correct also counts true negative right	He said it was the intersection of the labels tho Is he counting non labels too He said it was the intersection of true and predicted Does he mean TP + TN Now I understand his metric even less tbh
"yeah that's true, which means his ""correct"" is true positive"	Ehe so what is going on
what's going on is that he's basing his metric not in the matrix but on the resulting tags oh I just saw that email thread but I'm too lazy to read it oops	Yeah But I think the confusion matrix is important For classifiers where it's just as important to classify a 0 as a 1 It's fine im over it
well my scoring function starts from the confusion matrix so it's a compromise? 	Interesting interestinf I can agree Sort of
I should just print the confusion matrix out too huh oops much room for improvement btw cuda	I sawwww I set up my own conda environment already tho
"wait so Haimoshri ran LSTM model and it doesn't output any tags it is indeed 99.57% accurate (because true negatives) I think this is the reason why we need a better metric than just ""accuracy"" lmao"	Yeah Thats what I was saying U can achieve super high accuracy with no labels
also I'm created my new environment because ml doesn't have tf	If I want I have most of the dependencies on the nlp environment Except tensorflow But it has everything else
it's okay I already made mine literally arun lmao	Aye nice
it's tensorflow-gpu  I'm wondering why I can't run Haimo's code anymore	What error r u getting
something something cuda backed *backend idk might as well just leave it for now it's Saturday 	You're right it is Saturday Now that you're on cuda tho It might be that your tensors haven't been sent to cuda Aka converted to cuda tensors U can do it just like tensor.cuda()
I will try if I get less lazy	Yeah don't do it now lol Just relax
have you been running rum this past day ish?	sort of how'd u know lol i just started running it today my execution got stopped due to a gpu error which is strange so i had to remodify to use less memory on the dataloader which is annoying seems the GPUs on tor still have their limitations
lmao I just have top on all day even when I'm not doing anything like a creep	LOL are u checking the processes or smth
"yeah ""monitoring"" surveillance"	LOL wait what's the command to do that actually
oh just top	ohh
then c if you wanna see more details	what does that mean
"so instead of just saying the process is python it'd also tell you the whole command used for running that process so like ""python rum.py"" or something"	ohhhh that's so cool i see haimoshri has also been running LOL she told me she was having trouble with her nn zeroing all predictions the other day on bert + nn and the lstm
oh yeah I think it's fixed probably as training goes it first learning to make everything almost zero then they'll start learning the 1s	oh strange is that even possible if the weights get zeroed out immediately that's very strange
the weights don't get zeroed out I don't think?	it would be pretty hard to get 0s as the predictions then tho right from non-zero embeddings
I mean they're non-zero but they're like 1e-7 or something lmao	oh lol ok so it's saved from being completely zero
yeah	lol nice training might be done on the regular lstm for me by tmrw we'll see
tmrw meaning today 🤔	Ah Yes Today But idk it's epoch 16/20 This is what I get for not batching my data
whoops	But also you'd have to add a bunch of zeros to get the data batched correctly so Idk
"Max: ""Just keep track of your hours in a spreadsheet so that we can make sure to bill for them"" Me: whoops 40 hours go brrrr"	"LOL oop ARUN I DO NOT WANT TO DO PROCESSING ANYMORE we're done with the corpus lol btw like ""fixing it"" but anyways i keep getting played by tegmark i literally don't want to do this"
okay wait yeah I do think this is the most processing we need to do idk why we need to discard articles w no tags or short articles all articles matter	ugh i know
also the scoring thing I'll take a jab at it	oh from the nyt corpus papers? and putting them on the graph?
but I think it's just hard to put an actually accuracy number to our strange metric yeah	yeah same that's what i was going to ask u about
I can try reading through it	send on over the papers though i can read the data processing portions to see if they're cutting anything
but I do recommend the survey paper	is that a survey of methodologies?
yeah pretty full and updated compilation	ok i see is that in the channel
credits to Rubinovitz oop idk	what did tegmark ask u to send to me
um this one I think:  hopefully these papers don't process the NYT corpus so we can be done with that lol	LOL IKR let's just work on our models quietly lol allso when do u anticipate he'll let us move onto a different dataset
um idk there are a bunch of corpuses around for news tagging I don't think he'll make us move soon tho	:((
also what do you think about off week/on week	i missed that part do u mean we work on project c every other week yeah but none that are labeled right i wish we could lol it would be interesting to look at real news
"I think we'll both be on, then maybe Emily, Jianna and Sam can we on this week (because they've been ""off"" last week) and those on last week like Haimoshri can be off so she can work on project U some are I think New York Times is real news "	oh i see well i mean you know what i meannnnnn
but ig we don't have to be really strict just that we don't want the same people always working all the time to there's time for other projects/other ppl	oh i see that seems legit
but I mean I can't force ppl to not work on project C tho	haha yeah i mean if they're excited about it they;re excited
yeah but other ppl wanna work on stuff too I feel bad for them	oh u mean like other members of project c who can't contribute bc there's too many of us on the team haha
yeah	lmk if u need any help planning for project c :)) i really wanna start pushing max to let us explore some more datasets and clarify the direction of this
I have delivered an ultimatum in slack just now lol but it's for this week lmk what you think because you (everyone, really) have power to steer the wheel :))	ooh wow very well thought out arun i like it
ah tyty I wonder how often people check slack I also wonder if people want to have a meeting as well	other than emily i don't think slack is very popular for the team lol what do u wanna discuss
what's on slack (‿) and maybe general conversation lol	like next steps and tasks? to make sure everybody knows?
yeah something like that, and maybe about the readings or brainstorming idk maybe this can go next week ish	hmm yeah that could be a good idea
okay noted	i think the link you sent me is regarding relationship extraction from the nyt corpus did u find another source with classification tasks?
um not really	hmm ok cuz i'm searching online for relevant papers that do classification on the nyt corpus and i'm not finding anything
hmmm kinda same oh I see why not a lot of papers use NYT corpus... it has 594 fricking labels and not a more manageable 20 lmao also is it just me or is the tone a bit off hopefully she doesn't secretly hate me or anything okay I'm partly in the wrong because I didn't reply to the email between Max and Haimoshri about all the 0s that Max cc'ed me during the weekend oops	Ugh you're right lol The tone does sound off
maybe she's half pissed that I'm the coordinator and not her, judging from how she really focuses on project C and not project U which she's a coordinator in hmm	Lol don't speculate arun u should have some more pride She doesn't want to do any of the organizing work So at least now she does her own running
okay yeah that part's good lol idk I just feel competitive vibes ¯\_()_/¯ or just overthinking lmao	Yeah thats reasonable but also u shouldn't let her disrespect u I also dunno why she keeps working on c lol
well I mean if she works on project U too it's all good	lol yeah finished training small rum model yesterday + full lstm model evaluating on full dataset now
oh also I've historically been making a 75% train - 10% validation - 15% test split for my models idk if that's the best way to do it	oh yeah i forgot to do splits on my data before training it and i decided that since the data doesn't mimic real life news anyways might as well just use teh whole thing i think the split is usually 70 20 10 but i could be wrong oh it seems like the split doesn't really matter just depends on how big u want the test and val sets
Yeah it's up 25 bucks sinxe I bought it	That article was recommended to me by Google news lol LMAO BEN i see u going dead last
Haha yup Best for last	smh
Hey jamie For the triangular numbers program, do we have to save a0 to the stack or can we just override that since we aren't calling other functions inside of triangular?	Ovverride Use mv how did u use 0x40005000 it's pretty out a shit ton of 0's right now
Is that the permanent instruction counter?	yeah
At the end of the sort function, I made it print out the permanent counter	Did u load it like I did I made it print too But it's just like a shit ton of 0
It shouldn't be 0s It should be a lot of numbers, and then you separate the numbers by printing 0x0	Wait wdym print 0x0 Should it just be one number since it's a counter
You can print 0 in hex to separate all the numbers you printed	why does it print more than one numbe r what's the point of the printed numbers
Cause you call sort many times So you know how many instructions have been executed	oh but is there a way to do it such that you only get one print
I don't know how	missed your call. we're psetting 6.042 at 2pm :pp
Rip I'm doing the scavenger hunt thing	Lol what's that But Have fun
For ZBT Ok I'll def need help later though :(	It's OK bb lol dwai now Jus Have fun
? Ok Rip no study rooms, only the desks	6.004 results out
Yeah I saw Thanks	Can u let me know when the fire alarm is done
Yeah It's done now	Ok thanks  Here's the blueprint mentor stuff
Ok I'll see Thanks for sending it	Do we if we have class for 6s092 tmrw
Hmm prob not	:p
hm ok i think ill sign up for a blueprint shift do you have the google form? I think the one you sent me is like the creator version	go.hackmit.org/mentor Ily ty
np	ben can you ask your teammates to mentor with you for blueprint :)))))
Ywah	thanks bb
Hey how are 009 check-offs? Compared to 004 are they more strict/harder to get full credit, and can you redo them?	009 checkoffs are pretty chill in the beginning imo depends on what LA you get
Ok	but they don't really like it your code is messy
And do I need comments?	i commented a lot of stuff in the beginning towards the end i put like method docs but that's about it and just explained like line by line in detail sort of u can redo them if you don't do well
Ok What room is the hack thing?	when are you going to work on 006 today and can you help me
5ish? Yeah I can help on the ones ik I haven't done 4 or 6 but the other ones shouldn't be too bad	ok 5pm works i haven't done 5 and 6 and i only sort of did 3 and 4
Ok we can compare to make sure	okkk ty
Yeah of course	You called Benjamin.
She said you dont	But then why is it wrong Explain
idk :( can you take a quick look and see if I'm setting the key correctly? For all the test cases, my x value and topping score is right, it's just the y value that's wrong	can u just come over but yeah that looks right
Sorry not in the room rn Ok thanks	you're making sure to set the left and right key to the max_prefix keys tho right
Yeah, so if the max prefix is in the left subtree, the key gets set to the key in the left subtree Oh wait do I have to update the children's keys as well?  No right	no
Ok if you have time, for the test case, can you print the values of the new max_prefizes that are returned? Something like that if you're not too busy	Um it should just be the last two digits Of the answer
Yeah the answer should be 4 8 26, but for some reason this 1 pops up Yay I fixed it I'm literally so stupid Wtf	aiyo ben do you understand gravitational field calculations work
why do you need that for 8.02? um not really?	yes but i don't understand it maybe i can show you when i get back
yeah we havent learned that yet i think but i can see	ok thank you
Where are you? I'm in maseeh	I'm at circle table Quiet side Back of quiet side
Wait I want to talk later about why you thought jianna, and also why you were surprised	Ok
We can talk later Or if you're not tired after I brush my teeth	have we talked about everything we should talk about we can talk more about your situation if you want
Yah we can talk a bit more I would also like to talk more about ur situation :)	Oh no OK fine 
Damn how'd you know I'm about to post	I'm good like that Perceptive As hell
Haha funny Bro actually least perceptive You can't deny it	Feelsbadman Did u tell her anything
Yes I did	What did she say
That it's mutual	Well fuck Can we have a continuous conversation here btw What's the plan
Lol wait I'll talk when I'm home Lotsnof packing	What omg No spill the details  Its south FL But whagever
Sorry I didn't get to write a note on your birthday card Just wanted to say had a really great year with you and enjoyed your company	Aww Thanks Ben Ik I did write on yours But I feel like I should add here that I'm really glad I had a chance to meet u And that this isn't goodbye yet bitch U home now right
Yeah	:(( is your sister coming home too
Nah last few years of med school is rotations through the hospital Unluckily I think she has a ER rotation rn So rip	oh fuck hope she stays safe she probably can't come back for a while then right
Yeah but she wasn't planning to I think she was gonna travel to Asia over the summer but that's canceled, plus wedding is prob canceled too	wait what her wedding???
Yup	wait your sister was engaged wtf
Yeah	oh not that's so sad
Lol	unfortuante timing
She got engaged when I visited over thanksgiving Yup	oh that would have been so exciting
And then I was gonna fly out before finals for the wedding	oh was that the other flight u booked that u had to cancel
Yeah	damn do u approve of the guy
Yeah he's really nice No complaints	haha amazing lol ok do u want to tell me more now
Hmm....  feeling a bit tired Would you like to talk tomorrow?	oh this is past your bedtime yeah let's talk tmrw good nighttt
Gn!  Lol my mom sent me this parody of chengdu	did u just link me to a chinese description of boston's history or is there a video i should be watching somewehere
Lol there should be a video	ok i think that is the part that isnt loading so maybe this is why im confused
Lol ok nvm	:(( sad I definitely wanted to watch it Will let u know if it loads Thank u for sharing the Chinese mom humor much appreciated have u done 6 on 006 on part c where does the n^2 come from
You mean n^s?	no in part s it says n^2 c*
Oh it’s each move computation takes n squares	oh the computation for each move is n^2????
Yeah	can u join our call we have questions
did you figure out 4? im just confused how to make the vertices and edges at the beginning like how to convert the grid to a graph representation	okay hi yes u can just think of nodes as intersections and the edges between squares are the edges it's actualy the same problem but just shifted have u done the coding for 6 yet is it hard because i have so much shit to do over hte weeked
Yeah I get that representation, but I’m having trouble explaining how to create the graph representation from the squares Like for each pairs of vertices you connect, you have to know what type of squares they are adjacent to And I’m not sure how to do that in constant time	well each intersection only has 4 other adjacent intersections right so that's constant time u can assign each intersection coordinates that count as the node and easily find the four directions and just don't make an edge if the squares around that intersection are adjacent farm how are you storing the subsequences i'm doing array concatenation rn and i think that's what is taking so long because rather than O(1) time work for each of the k possibilities i'm doing almost n time work i think
Yeah I’m doing array Concat too	i realized i was concatenating per k options and it doesn't make sense to because you're always concating just the one current price
Yeah	it's a really interesting solution actually i figured it out as i was coding it cuz it was so hard to just think about i don't think i could ever do it by parent pointers that's really confusing to me
Yeah idk I thought of using parent pointers but wasn’t quite sure how’d it work But it took me a bit with indices cause I kept getting out of bound error	oh yeah you just have to check for out of bounds then index into the prices i think you keep one dict of length and one dict of parent but only set parent after u figure out which option has the largest length R u at Alex's extra oh
Nope	how else r u studying for the quiz i did the prac quizzes but idk what else to do
I’m not really studying for this one Idk just lack the motivation	Oh lol this is a surprise Yeah I've been feeling the same tho
hey jamie congrats on becoming VP of finance! do you have finals next week?	Hey thanks so much I have one on Monday yeah I'm leaving right away Tuesday though but if there's smth u need me to do lmk
okay will you be around for IAP? i probably need to brief you on the club finance situation idk how much you currently know	Yep Ive got an externship here in cambridge
excellent	Yeah that'd be great I mean
i too will be in cambridge	The only thing I know about is our debt but
yea i mean that's mostly it lmao just the extent of it and it's origins and how we've gotten money in the past i guess?	Ah okay that makes sense yeah let's set up a time to meet sometime over iap then
and what happened last year with finances re the VP of finance yeah let's do that doesn't have to happen now because that's like a month away but	Okay sure Yeah but it's nice to know in general earlier
sure we'll aim for something around january 6-8	Got it
hey jamie just btw if you haven't read the finboard policies they're available here: 	Ohgot it thanks Brendan! Will take a look niw
hey jamie do you have any free time today / next week to call about startlabs?	Yeah sure do u wanna call tonight
tonight sounds great if its not too late do you think we could try to not do later than a call at 7? i need to sleep early	Yeah sure do u want to do like 6pm
does 6:45 work?	sure
great im running late can we punt to 7-7:10ish	sure
ty hey were you considering MISTI for the summer?	i've been thinking about it yeah i guess i'm waiting to see how spring career fair goes but planning for it tentatively rn
ahh really caleb said germany?	germany, maybe china (i have no idea if the director of that will ever respond to me), and like smurf maybe yeah everything is kind of up in the air rn but i'm tossing my hat in for many things
o wild im deciding right now between germany and israel justins super helpful for germany adit did smurf btw and he loved it his freshman summer	oh that's awesome yeah justin has been great i should get in touch with adit to ask him about smurf
yes u really should ait imma sleep pls fill out the when2meet tho	wait i definitely thought i did right after our call today
o great i didnt check hey do you have any flexibility in meeting after 10:30 on wednesday?	Oh unfortunately I have a hack meeting every Wednesday at 10 which usually lasts for about an hour How long do you think our meeting would take maybe I can find time some other weekday at 1030
ok gotcha hm what about tomorrow? evening like 7ish or 9ish also did u find an online copy of high output management	Yeah 7pm can work for me Yeah I did
can u send it to me? pls	Yeah if I forget remind me to tonight I don't have my laptop w me at work
ok bumparooskj by the way i can keep you in the loop on the InternX stuff for the sake of finance I can brief you on it tomorrow but the gist is that InternX, outside of idea factory, would pay us for recurring product feedback on their recruiting platform essentially they recruit from STEM schools in the south and the startlabs insight into recruiting and a consulting-esque kind of thing would provide recurring value for them i think $500/2 months or something like that probably	oh great cool ok so this is also outside of idea factory? that's nb
thank you yes in addition to idea factory are we still good for 7pm tonight meeting?	Yeah r u on campus Do u want to meet stud 5
i will be, yes that sounds great lets do that	I'm running a little late think we can push to 715?
ok i am in the far pod on stud 5th athena	Omw R u on the new side
let me know if theres anything i can do for finance im here for u damn	Thank u good sir Oh what nice ^on the screenshot What's gc
no clue	Awesome
if u want to talk again before ur first meeting lmk super not busy	OK sure thanks
howd it go	Lol it was just Ruben but I told him to follow up w his companies And he said he'll talk to wilson Texted anjali too
did you expect more people?	i mean i was hoping i could meet isaac anjali texted me to tell me she was at target it's aight
toscano didn't show?	i'm gonna text them individually later to tell them their tasks nope
ok i'll give him a hard time please let me know if anyone isn't doing what you ask them to do	okay LMAO thanks brendan nobody checks the slack smh
you should make sure they all have slack notifications on not being responsive is #1 worst thing a team member can be	yeah lmao wait my notifs are on and sometimes i still don't get messages but yeah i indivudally texted the people on campus but they didn't respond yet so we'll see when is the next all team btw
so you won't get notifications unless you use @channel is that the issue? all team will be weekend of registration day	oh got it ok yeah lmao aight that makes sense uhhhhh that's unfortunate i think i'm home that weeken
ok we will see we haven't like officially planned it i guess	How about the Thursday before lmao Well that makes zero sense OK it doesn't matter Just lmk
lmao we dont really move the date bc it optimizes for attendance do u have strong feelings for being there	Yeah that makes sense No it'll be sad but I'll live
lmao startlabs-finance is now yours to use	amazing thank u sure sir*
ofc we'll call another time ! i gtg	aw mb i was hoping to join in a little later did u guys wrap up already
sorry i had to go yes	Ah ok
by the way, another finance issue is that we have sponsors who just havent paid so if we get the old sponsors to pay i think we get 1000+500+700 those are ABB, F10, and SMU	Do u have their contact info What's our process for submitting money to our account again
im talking with ABB, vaibhavi is forwarding me contact to F10, adit was in contact with SMU i believe they write a check to us and mail it to MIT	Alright cool To our mit account number right
i think i need to do the ABB stuff maybe i'll do that tonight they need an invoice generated with a bunch of info none of it which i possess	Life is a highway
truly is i found our old finboard applications  and this is a list of grants  i emailed finboard and ricardo, the head guy, asking for the status on debt forgiveness	Oh shoot totally forgot to respond This is great thanks What did he say
no worries im just chugging along he hasnt responded ill let you know if he does	OK cool I emailed the Sao desk like two days ago And they still haven't responded Gonna bump them soon
ok sorry i keep bothering you do you have a spreadsheet that would function as a startlabs balance sheet with EV of incoming funds or should i create that?	All good I do not have that yet Would be good to make one yeah If u have time that would be great
ok yes i have information that i would like to put down and is probably informative for you	Oh goodoe
i think we're still at the point where i'm transferring knowledge? right	Yes
like i just had a long conversation with adit yesterday about startlabs and even i forgot about some sponsors that haven't paid	Oh what
like the whole thing really needs to be organized yea lmao	Yeah okay That would be a good idea
ok thanks for putting up with me	Lol I should be thanking u what is this lol Thank u brendan For being so helpful
lol of course	#2 co-director
we all need a vaibhavi	LMFAO
btw  idk kyon and grassroots developer actual totals and my EV is just my intuition	Wait what does this EV column mean
its my likelihood for them actually getting the money into our account so our financial estimate can be somewhat reasonable	oh sad that we have such low confidence but ok
i mean idek what some of them are also they never signed invoices but adit says hes only known of one sponsor to ghost us so	Sad OK that's good
were u the BofA lead for idea factory?	Already followed up with but didn't get a response Think I'm being ghosted
ok i just met with sole and they were not happy	who is sole
its like the student activities thing for mit are you interested in meeting with them and me next week	oh renamed that's right uhhhh so why are they not happy
i think we need to pitch a debt recovery plan so apparently there is a lot of red tape we need to step through when talking to sponsors and doing contract services and stuff	oh hmm okay what time r u thinking next week i can do like 4pm tuesday and anytime after 12pm friday
so he said mondays and tuesdays work best for him but i saw a calendar and it looked pretty empty lmao	LOL ok so tuesday 4pm?
i actually hav ea class then friday i'm free should i ask for friday	yeah that works p well for me
ok i'll email and cc are you around	I'm at blueprint Stata
ok	I have a break at 3
no rush should i generate invoices for idea factory or would u rather do it / someone on ur team also did u setup a finance meeting	Not yet Am going to next week
ok	When do u need the invoices by I'm at bp all weekend
i can generate them its not an issue but if u want the experience of doing it	I want to do one at least lol Save me the least urgent one
ok	did u give me calendar permissions yet and did we get atlas account access
hey no and i doubt it altho u are now a signatory	what's a signatory
but i cant access atlas so idk whats up u can approve RFPs	oh i se
btw do u have time to meet today	how does 9pm or 930pm sound what's the website to access our startlabs account again also saumya and sarah have been asking me about budgeting things and money to be clear is our financial state in any position to be spending rn and how much spending do u think we can do between now and say tech trek
yea lmao these are all questions that need a meeting to answer basically its atlas to access i think i need to see if they actually added us because i dont have permission tho atlas.mit.edu and 9pm sounds good to me lets do that potentially google hangouts idk if ill he on campus	under which tab is it i was looking there as well ok 9pm is good
uh i think it says in the finance guide i dont know myself	yeah ok i'm not authorized either
ok	What's the move brendan hello are we still gonna do this
hey o fuck sorry i totally forgot and didnt put it on my calendar	Lol I have Smith rn But Maybe thursday
rip	?
yeah sorry that wasnt good of me	It's aight
i wasnt checking messenger i'm generally free in afternoons/nights so whenever works for you works for me there is a finance briefing from SOLE tomorrow 6:30-7:30 with free dinner if u want to go	alas i have lab in the evenings but will u be able to go
yes i will be there and will relay info also all of the questions about spending.. is really up to us once we have the debt payment plan we'll have the freedom to kinda spend as we want and it's just a matter of how conservative we'll be	ok hmm well thomas just pubbed the mixer so i think it's happening
ok so i think i'm generally interested in spending money on our community but also we will venmo request for alcohol lmao and if theres any leftovers we'll sell it back to pkt end goal is to not RFP	request who?
the startlabs members that take shots i think thats the situation right	oh uhhhh unclear
ok unclear as well to me	was gonna ask sarah but she has a fever today
wait ask what	about what they're planning for the mixer
o gotcha ok	yea
gr9 i generated an invoice for ABB and internx and sent it to them ABB hasnt complained yet so thats good i gave internx feedback on the briefs and sent capital one an email saying why they should still give us money	Wow Do u want to delegate any of this work to my team or smth
well im the lead contact for all of those companies delegation would be nice idk	ok lmk what u what u want us to take point on when they get back to u
i will handle these three contacts you shouldn't worry about them i want you to focus on your vision for finance i have enough bandwidth to handle them do you have finance people doing stuff rn?	No I've assigned tasks and told everybody we have a meeting on Wednesday but in general nobody's super responsibe
responsive? ok	Yeah But we'll see how Wednesdays meeting goes
okay. let me know what i can do getting people more motivated is tough and maybe we can brainstorm	Yeah idk we should probably meet to talk about this
ok u and me, or management, or ?	Hmm I think it could be useful for all of mamagement
ok hey how did the meeting go?	Uh it was alright Isaac and Ruben showed and had some ideas about next moves I think the idea is that we don't want to approach large companies anymore and instead we source small startups and do work for them for pay essentially And we build up like an executive team portfolio
interesting on a consulting kind of basis similar to internx?	Yes But for startups
coolio did the other people say why they werent going?	Neha was in office hours Shobhi has some thing Dev and Anjali are no show and no text Is idea factory up in the air rn Because time seems too short for us to do more and we've exhausted most companies and we don't know the status of grants yet
rip dev and anjali r i p idea factory is a go we will follow through with it	Okay We don't have money though
:P	We also don't have dev and anjali anymore
wut did they drop for sure	No but basically
damn which anjali	Singh
ok are we still meeting again also did ramon's time work for u	Oh shit this Friday at 1pm?
yes	Yeah I think it still works Is it stud 5 office
yes	aight DID U SEE JACQUI'S EMAIL
haha yea i was writing up a resopnse do u want to respond and take it on yourself?	oh i was about to write up a response
love it u should take lead on this oen	"aight down Hi Jacqui,

Thanks so much for reaching out! My name is and I am the VP of Finance for MIT StartLabs. We would absolutely love to work with Envel. Our executive team holds a diverse set of MIT students with a large range of skillsets – we’d be happy to send you a portfolio of our team’s resumes/skillsets. 

We are also holding an event called Idea Factory on February 29th, where students Harvard, MIT, and other Boston schools will ideate on a set of problems presented in the form of corporate briefs, which our sponsors would present. We would love to have you there! I’ve attached our sponsorship document for Idea Factory. 

We would love to build up a long-term relationship with Envel—please let me know when you are available for a phone call and we can discuss options! here's the response lmk if there's anything that doesn't align with your ideas"
do u want my critique	yeah give it to me
ok have u ever read anything on negotiation	no lmfao i didn't get into 11.011 either sad
haha its ok i have a copy of never split the difference if u want to borrow it	what's the move
but i think ur showing a lot of ur hand before u need to like i know a lot of this is trying to convince her to sponsor us, right but her cold emailing us and mentioning the word sponsor is a pretty good flag towards them wanting to esp offering to meet in person	hmm so i should tone it down is what i'm hearing
so i wouldn't list particular things at first but instead try your best to get on the phone or meet in person	sure
u always sell better that way always higher EV	ok
a sell works a lot better if u hear them tell u what u need and then maneuver ur value into their proposition	i'll just ask to meet/call then
like if they said:  we want a lot of recruiting, but honestly the student perspective on our student-oriented bank would be really helpful u could be like, actually, we already have startups sponsoring us on a consulting basis for that exact reason i would definitely do that	ok
i'd also not say resumes yet because while thats an easy value add, it doesnt translate into long term sponsorships ~ end critique but also one last thing to keep in mind we don't want to lose a potential startup partnership just because they won't pay a lot of money	yeah i'll just set up a meeting first then and keep these things in mind
them catering food for a startlabs-only tech talk with Q&A would be better than nothing :) i have a lot of faith in u no pressure just reply-all so nobody else replies after u	lol nice
i think i'm too overbearing	? why
do i give too much feedback or instruction or is it good and nice email	lol it was 3 sentences better to get feedback than none at al i wouldn't be here if i didn't want to learn either so this is good
lmaoo nice lmk if u want to borrow my negotiation book	ok i will do u want to join the meeting w jacqui next week
do u feel comfortable doing it on ur own?	it's no problem i can yeah just if u want to
i think u can handle it on ur own and its probably a worthwhile thing to do	ok sure i'll just schedule for when i'm free then
ok	Can u give me edit access t the calendar
o sorry yes and capital one for sure backed out	Ok Rip
dont forget about our 1pm meeting	Yep
im on stud 5	Omw I have room 5 231 booked
oh awesome thank you would us meeting again create more productivity before the all team	What do u want to meet for Or like What's the subjext
lmao i feel like i ask to meet all the time the concept of having a sponsor doc for startups specifically that focuses on value that they can add to us	Isn't it value we can add to them Or other way around
uh both probs uh lol	Okay yeah What do u think about collecting a portfolio of our members
for sponsors?	For startup partners yeah
not bad so like envel what do u have in mind for an ideal but realistic partnership	They hire a team of 4 to 5 of us to basically co op for a semester and they pay us smth like 5k maybe? Maybe less What number do u think is suitable
hm wait so they arent paying the students they pay us they would def pay the student there we're not a throttle	What's a throttle Yeah they pay us
like if its just a job they should pay the person imo	I'm not sure how it would work
ok lets meet sometime idk when we'll figure it out later	Ok ^bump on calendar
whats ur gmail again also u need to fill out the member feedback form	yeah i just saw jamie.fu@gmail.com
ty added you to calendar and drive anjali s just emailed me she'll be at the all team tomorrow also dev had filled out the attendance excusal form so maybe hes still in teh club good response to my email	Wow I am just seeing all these texts Yw
lol	Anjali is going to take point on innovation initiative
wilson has filled out or will be filling out part of the grant i dont know what	Oh
but he needs to be consulted on what is happening idk the situation	Do we still need to go on wedneaday
yes wait is she taking point on wednesday	Yes
o lit	What does she need to do Can u tell her
anj, you, and anthony all said they could go yes anjali s ?	Yes Dope
opportunity for the VC thing, i'll also send to zeke networking opportunity mostly	Who is zeke
isaac toscano	Tf Ok Cool Yeah pass to isaac
sent	cool

Please
 use this link to apply: <"	Just spoke with Jacqui she's primarily interested in hosting a worksHop and hiring some mit students I think her boss will give her a price range up to $1000 max
ok sounds like fun	I think it's just cuz founder wants to hire an MIT student or something lol Recruiting mostly
o excellent we love that how cool did they seem are u excited	Haha she was nice and sounded very new to this They're launching the product in March for beta testing at harvard It's actually an interesting concept The app looks pretty clean if that's a plus I can explain more details when u me Lillian meet I think this sort of sponsorship kind of falls into events
okay awesome lets do that then can also get her input	Yeah let's see what we can do with this
55 probs, 60 is at capacity	ok
r they thinking of doing some sponsor not too late to slide them in for a brief and network	"asked us if we would ""be interested in us hosting a workshop such as ""How to build a fintech startup?"""" yeah i mentioned idea factory"
oo thatd be kewl do u like that idea	"yeah i think it could be interesting do we want them to host it for some small ""sponsorship"" amount or smth"
so theyre asking to partner with us basically for the marketing ?	Wait who marketing O think they just want to host an event through us But do we want to do this for free
what do they get from it?	recruiting i believe i'm not sure why she wants to do it if it's recruiting but i think it's to enter our ecosystem and garner interest in their company
hm im confused lol	Yeah also They just emailed back to say they're not sponsoring idea factory but still want to host a workshop
ok thats fine	Yeah idk what sort of event they want tho
so perhaps we're not at the stage to make a decision but rather we need another meeting	To decide what to do with them? Yeah
yea like with them not with us	Oh I see yeah
perhaps email asking for more details on the idea and the value props for both us and them	OK sg
SMU sent in their $750 check so we have clinched another step towards $0 lol	Amazing forwarded you an email i think we stilli want envel on board with us but at this point this seems less financey and more event
ok do u like the idea	Could be valuable I just don't know why they're doing it This could be part of the biweekly things Should we ask them to cater food
:p yes i also dont know why theyd host probs to try and recruit startlabs which im fine with tbh is it worth soliciting management's feedback	Yeah at least we should talk to Lillian right
sure thats probably a good idea	excellent i'll get the numbers to you by the end of today
ty	i have unresponsiveness rn tho so we'll see
ok dm pla pls any update?	1 so far anton tho
wtf who hasnt responded imma get on their ass did ruben respond isaac is coming	i just asked them to like a message if they were going all of them read it and only anton liked it
can u DM them on messenger probably	yeah i'm about to do that
thanks bump	shobhi and anjali no ruben not sure
did u make it clear it was mandatory?	oh no i didn't
ok this is a recurring theme among VPs	mb i can let them know now what's the consequence oh jk shobhi is maybe
ag i'm really unhappy rn	i think that a big problem for startlabs members right now is engagement
can you respond in the chat pls	ok sure
did i get back to u wrt envel	About what we should do about them No not yet
u should pitch it at the all team and solicit feedback	Yeah good idea
hey so anjali s emailed me the baker foundation application asking whether i could provide the necessary info to fill out the application but its basically like the whole application? and i'm not sure like what the point of her filling it out is if she's asking me unless there's like something critical and i don't know how to say that she should fill it out nicely	uhhhhh i told her to ask u for some info but not thee whole thing and thtere's a sample baker app in the fin knowledge base which i pointed her towards soo maybe send her that link again and tell her to ask if she has specific questions
o ok is the whole thing the first two pages?	the baker foundation thing? yeah the template is linked and it should be around 2 pages yah
huh	brendan how intense should my participation from noon to 4 be i wanted to ask because i'm like hella hosed this week and next week so trying to see what i can get done before then but not sure how much time i'll have
hey i currently have u on a team which means u would not be working like on pset	ok what team is it
probably not internx because they've requested people who have done an internship before	oh wait wdym by team like a brief ?
yes	ok sure
if u really need to pset u can like be near the door the whole time and pset while at a table but thats no fun and you'd miss out on the event	yeah that'd be sad lol how much internship experience is internx looking for i do have some stuff but anything is alright
haha uh i have more faith in u placing u on the team that a lot of the other people in the workshop do u want to be on it?	u can keep it how it is for now it's fine w me either way :)) also i think i'm going to do smurf this summer to keep u updated on summer plans
really? great choice and i haven't chosen teams yet so we'll see tomorrow when i take a look smurf is a good choice u won't regret it i know someone who chose smurf over a quant internship [not that u should do quant] [quant bad]	lmfao me too actually i think we may be talking about the same person
probs i know like 4 people so u've covered most	omfg ok
 are u assigning teams as expected A-H	yep Be there in 3
ok ty did you want funding for a CRM? we've gotten funding for that in the past we can apply during the appeals round also we should provide feedback to dev thats kind of recognizes that he didnt have the info he needed to submit the app but also he should have figured that out lol	up to you i think it's ok so far without it when we scale up maybe we do he communicated with me about this that's mb i skimmed over the thing and thought it was ok but didn't look closely enough he talked to me about the info he needed and i pointed him to the knowledge base
ok its ok lol we live and we learn	:p Sad how much should we ask for from baker foundation
uh no clue tbh i don't know anything about the grant i know stuff about entrepalooza ?	hmm ok i'll go for about $2500 then
hehe yeet hey	Hi
is it true smurf is cancelled	Yes Sad I'm big sad
im sorry	Haha me too
do u want to work for a delta v startup	yeah that could be interesting i i'm trying to find something rn yeah
u should apply for the delta v internship program applications close in a couple of weeks	oh facts i should yeah Will send to u in two hours that's when I get back
ty	
ty are you on finboard-groups and did u get ricky's email	yes
ok tough attendance lmao do u want to make sure any of ur team gets a patty or do u want to delimit to total attendance	there's not anyone in particular i would particularly want to vouch for depends on how isaac and ruben do with this thing too
okey dokey	let''s make sure we also announce this attendance/pat thing at the next meeting
ok	i need to leave early from tonight's meeting i just had a last minute conflict pop up
ok no problem hey i sent u an rfp no rush	i just saw it what do i do with it now ther'es only a send back button but that's it
honestly i have no clue really? hmph u might need to explore atlas a little bit	did u attach a receipt also
i need to eat dinner tho i did whats up also rip startlabs spring 2020	ok so should you be the payee
i think so	because it looks like we can only charge to MIT or tech review
we are charging to MIT i put in the cost object for startlabs	where do u want the check sent to
oh i should have my bank account setup with atlas	it seems you have limited options
wait no that looks like ur creating a new rfp one sec	wait wtf ok i see what u mean ok i'm no longer getting any actionables
hmm ill take a look dw about it for now do we have time to revisit the rfp	yes
now or later	i can do it now did you see if there was any communication on your end about the rfp
i haven't gotten any emails i did get approved for my travel rfp tho	i don't have any more actionables here on the link that got autosent to me who does the final approval for rfps
i think mary mango but u never hit an approve button right r u in My Reimbursements Inbox on atlas?	yep there's no approve button there was only a send back button which means that i would be saying smth was wrong with your rfp i cliked into it and hit save tho and that's when the action button disappeared
what does save do?	i'm not sure but i was able to look over your rfp and make modifications if i wanted
ok do u want to try sending it back o wait stop idk what u did but its with mary mango rn yay	yeah i just sent it on to her
o nice lmao	i think
so thats it	that's what i'm supposed to do
we succeeded	oh perfect amazing
lmao yay thank you	this hwole system is jank it sucks
it really does	:// the mit difference
lmao	are we still gonna do an 8pm today i moved smth from 8pm to 730 but i still have the 830
11pm EST looks like it works the best right now so probably not thank u for moving things tho i appreciate it	yeah np so 11pm tn?
lets plan on that hey how likely is u doing 10pm	uhhh maybe i have a meeting at 9pm which i don't know will go for how long
okey	Actually I think we only have one thing to discuss so I might be able make 1 10
ok	let's migrate to mit's enterprise slack plan
o yea i didnt mention that i need to explore that	yeah yay free things did you see alex nowak's email today
uhh yes i hit unsubscribe and threw it away did u want to talk to him lol seemed like spa mto me	no i was just curious if you were interested
ah negatory	ahah ok
im gonna do another RFP for the idea factory materials bc it doesn't look like we're gonna have the finboard funds	ok got it
internx has a $1500 check on the way and we should be getting more 	ayeeeee
great way to cover $8000 in losses lolrip	Did u see the thing I forwarded u and wilson Like about the unrecoverable losses
yes i did	Does each start labs member need to Fill it out individually Or should we collect
i will check with wilson do we have any unrecoverable losses outside of the tech trek? it seems to me that we haven't committed to anything outside of that	Yeah unless we fronted some costs for cpw or smth
i don't think we did  i think this is now updated right	OK cool Then it's just those things yeah
i sent another rfp mary mango is taking her sweet sweet time	Dis u send her a separate email or smth Or is she just not approving the rfp
haha she hasn't approved it yet	Rip
lol but feel free to approve anytime	Approved an hour ago
ty	yeep if mary mango doesn't respond for the next few days i can bump her
theres no need i can do that also we're waiting on two checks of $2500 total and hopefully another $1500 from internx	ok nice what's our moderator pswd for the mailing list
uh i think its lab2start do u want to approve the 100k	it already got approved by you i thought i see it in the startlabs folder anyways
MIT 100k Competition Deadline extended ? i haven't approved it	oh huh well it's not lab2start
labs2start? i can find it if thats not it	oh yep that's the one ok done
yeet gty	?
idk why i sent gty	lol ok thanks
o it was ty i think for approving also i need to do the plans for the semester wow	yes lmao weren't we supposed to have alll team last sun
gray area? lol was that the timeline we reached at the management meeting	uhhh potentially
rip	its aight we didn't pub it anywyas but until we figure out what we're going to do we can't really
agree	Hey I can't make the first part of the meeting today but I'll dial in as soon as I can can we foreward the rfp denial to ramon
ill just tell her that ramon approved it shes being annoying	lol ok
they approved the other one smh	lmao nice
also i got it approved - tax the cost of being codirector	LOL yeah they don't reimburse tax sadly but ayeee
lmao hey we should brainstorm about what we need to submit for unrecoverable losses We’ve heard that some groups have losses that the current unrecoverable loss form doesn’t explicitly have a category for, including expected revenue from events that won’t be happening any more. If that’s the case and you have any financial loss in any way that will cause your group to lose money, fill out the form anyway! < If you lost money due to cancellations or budgeted for having money that you won’t be receiving any more, we want to know so we can support you. from asa	Yeah I forwarded that to u and wilson A while ago regarding tech treks i have an interview @ 10pm tn brendan i won't make skribbl :((
ok sad	Ik Real sas sad
hey we should powow	what does this mean also make sure u fill out the ASA form
wait which form about what	to maintain active status it just got sent out today what is powwow
oh right yes good idea	why
lmao uh financial reasons for the slabs of slabs	i don't understand what you're syaing
lmao are u able to hop onto a quick zoom call	rn?
yea	i'm w my family eating dinner rn but
super unnecessary LMAO	like about later?
dont interrupt yea i'll hit u up later	LOL ok
u up	theoretically no what's up]
lmao conceivably SOLE gave us $9k not all of which need be distributed to startlabs members	conceivably what may this mean for startlabs
this is unclear and it may be up to us	haha what ru thinking should we use this to offset some of the losses from the tech trek trip
well so thats the idea but like my train tickets are on there and while i havent been reimbursed yet i'm still trying to get reimbursed	oh like you've made requests for them did wilson tell everybody else to also file requests
yes and some people for sure won't be getting a reimbursement so they'll be reimbursed with this butttt some of us will	oh cool wait why just by chance? well what are your ideas for the rest of it then
uh their airlines rejected it or they didnt bother to try for it or something maybe like 5 people? it depended on the airline and so like they just credited it to our main account sooooo...... my idea would be not doing anything 	omg up to u then sir
hey did you ever get summer plans going, ?	Yeah sort of all just be remote uroping this summer
thats cool whats the project?	It's an ML project for new bias using NLP News* I'm not sure the details tho tbh
max tegmark???	Yeah lol u know him or smth
omg hes super hype ai + physics wow thats awesome good for you	Hahahah OK good I hope it's legit Yay thanks Wbu What r u doing
so my misti was cancelled w no remote so thats fun im doing two hopefully chill urops one in statistical modeling for particle physics theyre trying to measure the mass of the neutrino and another is self directed in csail where im doing stuff with matrices hopefully do a startup tho thats the real tea	Yo that's cool Two urops big guy
both part time lets not get ahead of ourselves	Bigggggg guy Yeah all my mistis got cancelled too
sad sad times	Yeah big rip lol tech trek travel reimbursements go to mary mango right
yes but we dont have the SOLE funds yet so i wouldnt approve it yet do u want me to add u to the group chat	sure ^ do i approve adriano and send to mary mango now
hey no we don't have the funds in our account yet :p still waiting	oh rip ok
heehee howre u doing u doing ok?	yeah i'm alright how about u
doin swell have u given any thought to the upcoming year and whether or not it'll be remote	f yes i think it's not looking so hot atm
yea i think usc just announced they'd be doing in person for the fall but i doubt mit will do something like that all the policies r sad	oh shit really yeah stanford also announced some weird thing yesterday
yeah its supposed to be combo in person/online but everyone will be present on campus yeah i saw that too all of mit's proposals are like very .. hmm	yeah rip :( should i take a gap year
its like the degree ur gonna get is of lower quality bc the classes are lower quality	yeah

where did you see this??	Apparently someone who knows bloombergs daughter said this in a slack chwnnel
Nloomberg does not control boston?	Yeah it's because NYC is set to shut down and we're supposed to follow suit

oh wowowow ur so good :D	well it's a powershell script so i think he just
what is dat	couldn't find a suitable task like powershell is like the windows command line thing that's more powerful than terminal i think and like u can connect to this cloud service that microsoft has called azure and do stuff automated
oh ew command line	uhhh all command line can be written in scripts tho it's like python can be line by line in the terminal too
o ayh	so it's like writing a bunch of powershell commands in a script so u can run it all
but its so much grosser	haha i mean it's like not bad
o okay das good!	i'm learning powershell
:DD	and i learned http requests
omg wait i m doing that rn kinda	so that's kind of cool oh shoot cool what are u doing
well im updating their android app bc the http apache library they used is now deprecated	is that android studio?
so i need to refactor the code to okhttp yeah	what the heck is okhttp
its a new library and its a little diff so i need to rewrite a ton of stuff :( and i dont understand but my dad looked and said he could help so yay i feel so privileged tho whenever my dad is able to help me	aha yay that's good idek what okhttp is rewriting a whole app is tough bro

oh my wait but that’s just html stuff right	html css js i don't think they make it with react
... gross	unless im mistaken
:(	lol sorry bb
can i ask to do spectacle instead	yes probably do u know if i have to go to the lecture i'm assigned for 8.02
nah you can choose i think like you can change it	isn't it teal lab tho
actually i don’t remember what i did	because there's like a tent schedule out rn and i want to go to the classes how i've arranged it in firehose
wait no i don’t think you could change it unless you had a conflict	which btw makes me have all 9 and 930ams sorry
what’s tent schedule	oh i have a conflict and that is lunch
HAHASJSK	tentative schedule
What whereomg	sameplace as always studentschedule.mit.edu
omg	it's grayed out rn
whaat are these like	but i think that means they put it in the system
schedules based off preregistered prereg	because they haven't lotteried 11.011 out yet for sure yeah prereg
o man	jianna's fucked lmao
my prereg has like 10 classes bc j couldn’t decide	LMFAO you're tripping i have 6 and i feel like it's a lot
ohhhh boy	lmao dang u pre reged 11.011 too? LMAO beautiful
hehe yes the syllabus makes it seem like a lot	i would just go for 6.006 and 6.009 honestly u can do it intro to acting sounds fun if u get into negotiation with me tho that'd be lit wait yeah 11.011 sounds really intense so if i get in i'll probably drop 6.08 or smth
nah i don’t wanna do both i think i’m doing 006, 1806, 802, hass ooh let’s take 608 together sometimes sometime	Do u like math Is hat why yore taking linear
eh	I'll see if I can manage 6.08 firdt
i just want to do ml stuff later on like ik it’s not necessary for 6036 but anyone in ml should have a good foundation in linalg so if ml is really something i wanna do i should probably take 1806	Oh huh interesting I was just gonna take 036 and chill wit
hahaha yeah i was gonna	Hopefully the Lin alg is not too tough
but idk everyone i’ve talked to says linalg is important	I mean like I feel like if you're applying ml stuff u need to understand r conceptually by probably not too deep into he actual math of it Unless you're thinking like hardcore research Postdoc sort of thing
yeah that’s if you’re just applying the libraries but i want to try going more in depth that’s where the moneys at🤑🤑 jkjk idrk but i figure it doesn’t hurt	Lol it can only help
might hurt my grades but o well HAHA	Lol You'll be aigg Ht Gotta sleep now btw Gotta go to work in 8 hours!

yeah  not like we live in the same room o whateva	:pp
JAMIE how tf have you read 83 APPS	IT SAID I HAD TO READ 99 BFORE SO I WWS GOING THROUGH THEM WHYILE MY TEWTS WERE RUNNING AT WORK they just divvide the number of total apps by the number of people signed up and when i signed up there was nobody else yet
omg lol HAHAH	Bro literally so sqd
You missed a call from Claire.	i'll call u in a bi calling my parents rn
oh okay sorry	no worries
just have a question about how class scheds work	what's your question
does this mean im in mohameds? or do i need to check again tomorrow also this isnt final obviously do does that mean my 9-11 spot in 802 might change?	yes you are it's automatically assigned i need to switch in
oh okay so i’m fine even if i change my other classes later on ?	what do u mean change your other classes
i’m dropping half of the ones i preregistered for lol which opens up slots for 802 that i could take also which 006 rec are ya taking	lmao yeah that sounds like a good idea 11am
 i’m 1 i think	Saddddd So what classes did u decide on
1806, 6006, 802, hass hopefully 11.011 but prob acting	Oh niceeee Sad that u dropped 004
wat but you’re not taking it SEE YOU IN 15 MIN YAYAYAYA	LOL I'm not back from work yet bb Feel free to move my drying rack back to its old loc i'm actually leavning early today 5pm baby
wanna go to life alive tonight w me and two tai	I'm going to the airport at 4pm :((
oh aw okay	:(( sorry Wanna go eat
oh man i’m so sorry i forgot and already ate	Lol It's aight
JAMIE YOU ARE DOING AMAZING :D	LOL OMG CLAIRE love the support
im a proud mom everytime you speak	you're so cute
no youre cuter <3	no u i switched to 125 no swipey swipey from me OHO MY SOCIAL CHAIR BONCHON I'm about to leave r u coming up soon
no i’m eating	OK imma leave then :oo
can u help me w my favicons later today?	Yes
dumb question but how do you access an element in a tuple of tuples like if i have B = ((1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6)) can i say B[0][1] if i want to get 2	Yes
wait ok so i have one nested tuple ((1, 2, 3)) and i tried saying B[0][1] to get 1 but it says that B[0] is 1 and it wont let me do B[0][1]	Has to be list of tuples Two tuples just go to one tuple I believe
ugh but that makes it so difficult are you coming back up?	Yes Wait manipulating a list is so much easier
oh	claireeeeee can u tell me everything that u think is wrong with logs on hack rn and if there's any wide sweeping changes we can make to improve logs for everybody
what if i scheduled a chat w jack just so i can chat w jack logs is kinda eh people arent responsive	LMAO why don't u just talk to him without scheduling a chat
im shy 	poor bby jack is just so unreachable like 5 feet away unreachable
jamie for director no vishruti	damn bro you really be saying this 2 feet away vicious
im just supporitng my gorl <# <2 <3	omfg ok thank you for your support
<3 how is xfair is it worth going to	it was pretty interesting if u have time to go just go talk to some recruiters and get to know them? idk if it's useful but it's interesting
still 3pm w alex?	yes will u ask him where cool i have to walk from stata so i'll be a little late
are you coming to hack party pls	Hi I am on my way up But I'm really tired
okay but you’re still going right	Uh
ur turning in my pset right?	Oh yeah I brought them all with me I haven't turned them in yet tho I'll do it in between lec
got your email	tanks claire
yah did you turn in 802	yep If there any CQs can u tell me to click real quick I just woke up Colleen gave me a fucking 80 on the last pset
HAHAHA I GOT A 78	bro can she chill the fuck out i need to switch tables
i asked her why and she said bc it was identical to the answer key she’s not wrong but	my answers weren't?????
oh	i actually did that fucking pset
did you ask her LOLOL omg	"no she yeeted before i could find her she always takes like 9 poitns off for ""direction"" like bro u know what direction it be in"
like the hats? and signs?	yeah like the units are on the online pset so i never write them and she took poitns off for the stuff in the back too like the open ended ones shit i gotta stop submitting to table 5 damn my last pset is so bad too i'm so fucked
you’re chillin lol it’s pnr	i mean it's on my IR so this is bad because i want my IR to be good too
wait why who’s gonna see your IR	it depends on what industry i go to because idk yet
6-2 babYYYYYY	oml
wait it only matters for like mad school right	i think i'm going to be 6-3
med	and like finance industry
oh really hm big quant girl?	lmfao i wish i'm p sure i'm not sure actually but
what	this is my own personal pride why is she taking points off for something i know
wait just talk to her	she's gonna be anal about it ik ig i'll try to make time to ask her about what i did wrong
wait colleens pretty chill	but it won't be this week she's like a chilll person but not a chill grader
cq	Love u
yeah u too	Found u an in n out
omg u had me so excited ihy	LMAO was it funny tho
no i’m sad	Aww Poor bby :( whenever ur free can u give my credit card to anjali singh
yeah i gotchu	Tysm Ily She's at new house rn But when she gets back I'll text u How r u doing bb
doing great lol tai and jianna just left i am a mess	OH NO I'm so sorry We'll call evey day dw Since I'm locked up in the room rn I'll be making the shared calendar all day
HAHAH okay sounds good	Life will start looking up don't worry I got your back no matter what
ily so much	:D send pics when u have time sir what are some memorable moments we had this year
sorry just got home too many :( lemon shirt housing chairs doing me dirty its lit like litmus paper my squishmellows;((((((( cheering each other on at go/hangouts	Awww ty claiee Ily Hope you're doing ok Stay safe bb
ily mORE and thanks u toooo	:DD i am doing ok in michigan california is less safe
lol how many cases bruh my mom is going crazy she’s labeled utensils and plates for me and like wiping down every surface i touch	LOL i have been in my room for the past two days going on three! and i can't do any of my homework because all of my notebooks are still in the car because my parents won't let me take it out yet claire
HAHAH THIS IS SK FUNBT Also ?	it's actually so sad
is this for this year or last year	our year
dang	these numbers are crazy
david lu was 1/17 of those	LOL wild
whats the mit wifi vpn you were talking about?	it's just openconnect vpn vpn.mit.edu
wait have you gotten it working i cant login	u need to donwload openconnect on your phone sorry it's called anyconnect cisco anyconnect
wait i need access on my laptop though so download any connect on both?	yeah
okee thanks ugh wiat login still not wokring whats the second password oh wait nvmnvm got it woo	oh wow you've been trying for a while what do u need the vpn for
wait no i tried for 5 min earlier and then for another 5 min just now urop and xfinity HAHAH	oh LMAO nice ok
but mostly xfinity :))	well i haven't done any of my urop work so thank for that motivator maybe i'll actually do something tmrw
yeah me too	eek same boat
i’m waiting until i’m so bored that i have motivation to work bc right now i am content w doing nothing	yeah same LMAO been watching this show all day
which show	the good place just finished season 3 to be fair the episodes are very short
ah have you beenw atching w taiboy	no lol he's like still on season 2 he'll catch up eventually maybe maybe not
>:( you should watch w him what kinda gf	omg why r u doing this to me
<333 bc you guys are the cutest	omg ok thanks claire i appreciate it
:) <3 taimie forever jamie my motivation has returned slightly!!! goal is to start 802 today lets keep each other accountable	yayyyyyy i need help on 802 i've not done all of 2 and part of 3 so plz help
bruh i read 1a and have no idea what it means lmao	that's the one i sent link for
oh yeah still dont understand most of it do you	meh only partially
ok same do you know what a-hr is	amp hours i *t
ohohooh ok for part c i did (answer from part a)*.4 but its incorrect also wtf did they add questions to the pset	which question? yeah it's from friday problem solving but the first 4 are so hard
1c lol still on #1 idk how to do 2 or any of the others lol fuck	it's divided by 2 for 1c because the resistance is doubled
but the efficiency is .4 right	it has nothing to with efficiencybecause you alreday accounted for efficiency in part 1 1a it would be halved no matter what efficiency it is
oh whoooop bro this pset is hard :( 2b and c are 0V	Tyty Did u end up figuring out the rest
l o l nope i gave up	Nice Also I'm really sorry about the Netherlands thing btw
:( idk if its cancelled for sure bc skilllab sent me this today i think its still happening but im just losing misti's travel reimbursement? not sure	Oh nice that means they might be able to let u work remotely?
this was before justin sent the emial though	Or still do it but without funding
yeah it seems like theyd be able to set something up without misti? we'll see	Yay that could be good
i wouldnt really want to do it remotely though.. kinda defeats the purpose maybe i should start looking for jobs here	Yeah igs Do u have travel plans already
yeah lol my fam was gonna go to portugal and spain	:((((
have we ever had spring rolls and fall rolls omg we should do fall equinox and spring equinox	ooOOOH
LOL	lmao what what are fall rolls i'm kknd of down tho
idk what are fall fishies	bro i have no clue
i feel like we've definitely done spring rolls though	it seems pretty obvious so yeah probably i can ask jack ok yes we have
aw poo springtime? handspring! downfall! nightfall lol im so bored snowfall offspring spring constant HAHAHHA wow youre welcome these are really good ideas if i say so myself	OMG what but they dont have pairs what's a handfall fallhand
not all of them have to make sense though like fallafels and springfels? or fallboard oh wait fallboard is a thing	yeah wait jack said that they've all been things was nightfall and upspring a thing alread
what is a springfel LOL	bro no fucking clue but apparently it's a thing
i think its time we scrap this idea and start a new tradition	LOL there's a reason it's called tradition
but theres nothing else to do also what is a fallroll i find it difficult to believe that all of them have been real things	rainfall springrain spring wood autumn wod
i really like spring constant fall constant can be 9.8	LMFAO one is k the other is g nice
yeah can we please please director	lmao i'm like an apprentice also i don't think associating our recruits with physics constants is gonna be amazing lmao although it is interesting
:''( ok then	haha i like it though how about this if we don't think of anything better i'll advocate for this i'm already a meme anyways
HAHAH okay i can live w that holy shit i’m sweating so hard i was late to my urop meeting bc i got the time diff mixed up i thought it was an hour later than it was i’m so embarrassed this happened once when i made a phone appointment with justin over iap ugh get better claire	LOL WHAT Oh no Was it OK in the end
yeah HAHAH i was like 10 minutes late i jumped outta bed and straight onto my call LOL	Ugh I haven't done any of my urop work Big sad
its so hard to do work at home or when theres no one pushing you to work	:((( i literally don't want to do anything
i see you making go links for nm though!! HAHAH	;))) see u tn
see you soon babygirl 	:oooo
jack looks like a lil boy w his haircut hehe	omg lmfao
jamie have you read the book yet three body prob how did the week pass by so quicc book club meeting is tomorrow and i havent sTARTED THE BOOK	No I haven't started reading it yet either
are you going to book club tonight also do you want me to explain i can call u	i'll probably sit in but i haven't read anything yet my dad is having a meeting next to me rn
o ok hi papa fu :)	he's not like next to next to me haha
oh	he's like in the room
oh tell him hello	ok i will haha
tell your squishmallows hello while ur at it :)	oki
dude	i will also do that
im scared for 006	i'm fucked on so many levels i'vve accepted my fate
are we still working w the 6006ies idk what their moral standards are	i'm probably going to take the exam on my own but i probably won't actually try to make a crib sheet i'm too lazy for that i'll just keep a bunch of papers next to me
wait yeah im just gonna have my notebook out HAHAH ill be frantically flippign through the pages sweat dripping everywhere	:(((( it's not even going to save me at this piont you have to like use your brain to come up with shit and stuff
yeah like u gotta be creative but i cant be creative under pressure	i literally don't even know what to think of crazy
have you done #2 for 802	i submitted the thing haha yeah it's like u write i1 and i2 in terms of Vin and sub in for the currents in Vout
omg whOAH go you and okay i got it except the answer was negative of my answer :((	Lmaooo
is it bc the battery is facing the other way	I think there was something wrong with 9ne of the answer checkers But everything else was confirmed Probably?
should Vin be V1-V2? since the positive side of the battery feeds into V1 idk if that made sense	Oh Yes I think
okayy tyty wait also u know how the two ends aren't connected how is there a current then	idk there just do be
LOL okie sign sigh	it be like that idk anything
no shuddup you did the whole pset on your own tf u saying HAHAH	wait anjalie helped me with 2
wait ugh why are b and c 0V	resistance all the same or ratio of resistances is the same so there's no like difference between the two paths
omg yeah ok im a silly goose sigh im sorry for all the questions	you're good lmao i'm trying to not do my 006 practice anywya
are you going to alexs review /study session	yeah
YAY for seeing your cute lil face	no u <33
wait sorry for 3d how does resistance come into play? electric field = potential diff / separation dist right? or like thats how we did part b	Yeah but current changes Due to the extra resistance And therefore the voltage drop across the gas part is different Even tho total voltage drop is the same
o man OH are they in parallel wait ill try it on my onw	OK lol
nvm i give up i have no clue what is going on i dont really understand like how the resistance from the dust on the plate affects the gas? or like i cant conceptualize it as a circuit so i dont understand how theyre supposed to be in parallel or series	They're in serirs Because it's like plate dust gas plate
but theyre not like in contact right	they are plate - dust - gas - plate like a capacitor
oh the gAS has resistance? i thought it was the particles in the gas sigh big silly	well yes the particles that make up gas have a resistance
oh i meant the dust particles or whatever they’re trying to filter out but yeah makes sense nowww	lol yeah
OMG SANJAY GUPTA WENT TO NOVI WOAH	LMOA YEAH His brother still lives like am hour away
WHAT THATS SO CRAZY maybe no6 isn’t irrelevant after all???	Ehehe We used to have world famous figure skaters too And we have the natioanl junior ice hockey team
LMAO i’m sorry for all the times i’ve bullied you i can’t believe sanjay gupta walked through the same halls as you *you walked through the same halls as sanjay	LMAO He don't give a shit about us
oh he seems so cool though also could you tell me what you got for #4 problem 4ii and iii its just plugging in numbers but for some reason my answers are incorrect >:(((((	uhh can u send me a screenshot of the quesion
should just be plugging in answers from earlier parts but its not working	i think your answer may need to be more precise
hm i tried putting in more sig figs but it was still wrong	what was your answer with more sig figs
iii was 2.8098*10^14 and ii was 5.179*10^12 also did you do the desmos stuff	oh those numbers are a bit off
oh cri	idk if your calculations from before were overly rounded it's 4.522 for ii and 2.1604 for iii
oh what the hecc okay ill check again	yeah
thankss	yeppp i left everything in terms of the formula
also did you turn in the desmos short answer questions	for the top two so when i calculated it was like uber accurate uhh
über	i turned in one sent explantations
fook ok i dont understand :(	i put germanium for both but like i'm probably completely wrong i've kind of given up at this point tho
i got germanium for the first one but dont understand anything about the second one lol yeah i think i might just bs something sorry colleen	the second one if more intuitively germanium i think because the number density increases at smaller temp
the only thing we're changing on the graph is E_0 and a and b right between materials? my graph is barely changing	uh you should change everything that has a slider for it like so was it nv and nc
oh fuck that LOLOL	lmao
oh wiat that makes sense lol	yeah beause the different elements have different nv an nc
u know for this questions for part a how do they get 4/pi*d^2 in dR	oh is this the answer thing i sent u pi * r^2
oh is it	area
i loked it up just now	where did u get that oh d is diameter
ohh	so they just simplify d
my god omg i hate myself	lmao
im so sorry	i was really confused when they did that too
for asking you so many questions	it's just because they want to keep everything in original terms
HAHAH little brains unite!	nah it's alright i like asking other people for help too it's so much faster than trying to figure it out on your own
whos ur plug	i don't have one for 8.02 yet :((
oh	anjalie helped me tho on 2
did you do everything else alone wow	the last few were like the regular pset questions so it was alright for the lessons u just have to answer the graded quesitons right the ungraded ones and watching the videos themselves aren't like kept rack of in some way right
yeah i think so have you done it yet bruh why are they making us one tomorrow im upset	lmao ik so fucking stupid to have things due on monday morning wait this means the lessons are the prepsets right like why is their stuff to do over the weekend
yeah the prepsets we had to do on sundays were bad enough but now theyre replacing them with whole ass lessons	two of them too does this even make sense
yeah	if u need help i did all of next week's
natasha said they dont take too long wait WHAT bruh why i hate you actually no i love you	so much easeir than studying 006 dude i haven't done any 006
oh	it's like my way to be like oh i'm doing something productive
wait YES this was me last sem with 801	LMAO all the time
i did it everytime i wanted to feel smart or feel like i knew things	yeah i like the green checkmarks
OMG ME TOO HAHAHAHHAHA they amke you feel so warm inside	accomplished yessss
like youre floating on a cloud	LOL that's a different exepreicne
who needs drugs when you can use mitx	eek the mit difference
:D bro the seawater solution makes no sense did you understand it	what i'm not there yet what
the last one on the pset 802	Oh no I didn't get it I wouldn't have been able to come up w it on my own
:( have u been reading	I accidentally finished th whole thing lmao
holy it’s so long wtf is it good?	It was really good
i read the first chapter and was a little spooked	The first chapter is back story
oh okay i’ll continue reading	sorry i meant to continue this but it's interestin it gets spookier r u going tn
lol i did not as u probably know i didn’t think it’d be good if i had only read 1 chapter LOOL also it gets spookier?? bruh i can’t	boo do it it's really good
i can’t do scary things	it's not scary it's just like a tad existentialist like does science exist kind of existentialism
oh really hm okay have you done this question yet on the bst doc in alex's google drive	"holy wtf no i haven't looked at anything in alex's drie i've ""done"" three practice exams"
ayee	its sad
jamie let me into the mtg also yes i agree theres so much material to study OH WAIT ITS ON ZOOM HUH	F Yeah
L O L	ok i just looked at the q u sent me that's really fucking hard lmao
i literally just dont understand it at all like i have no idea why they make a set avl	it's like u make a set avl of variables
for the most recent access numbers like what does that even mean	like if i accessed a once at 0 and again at 6 then the most recent is 6 and each variable is keyed by their recent access number in the set avl tree
oh so the letter is stored in the node	yes
ugh okay i need to read it again i gave up the first few times i tried to read it	lol it's hard
that was so hard i ran out of time	wait alex talked about the index one i completely confused wait u don't know i you're trying to find i
oh my god LMFAOIM SO DIMB	LMFAO omg bro i was like how did u find that so easy
omg what i’m so disappointed in myself there goes 15 pst	lol what did u write
what alex told us	well
lol	it doesn't matter lmfao it's over now
wait isnt it just oh wait	why
somthing with the subtrees LOL	uh
fook idk	u can't do more augmentation beyond what they gave u
subtree sizes	f oh well yes it is
lol	but it kind of sucks
i will think about it later	don't even bother lmfao it's over now
wait okay so you go up the tree until you can determine whether it is in a left or right branch and you always add it’s left sub tree size and if you find it was in a right sub tree you add it’s parents left subtree size and 1 ? i not sure but this is what i came up w during dinner	i went all the way up
wait yeah	to find whether each was left or right
but as you’re going up you need to consider it’s position in the sub trees	and then if it was a left child add left subtree if right subtree do nothing
why do nothing	sorry other way around if i'm a right child add my parents left child size if i'm a left child do nothing
oh okay yeah i can agree w that wait is there 006 recitation tomorrow	I wrote it in such a hurry I think I'm wrong I'm not sure
wait nvm it starts friday	Oh nice
whatd u get for this im out of attempts LOL yikes i got cocky and used my last attempt so nvm lol	yikers okay do u understand it now i had to look that one up i sait that the b field would try to align
i dont completely understand like how to do it their way	uhhh what was their way
where t = mu x b whats the axis for the torque like how do you know what the reference point is	well didn't they provide the mu vector isn't there a video like before or after explaining this problem i can't remember lmfao
yeah but daddy didnt say how the loop rotates like for the question above t points into the page but how does that relate to it rotating clockwise?	wait aren't u supposed to use i for this particular problem
this was the answer where do you get i from?	wait yeah that's what i said too rotate clockwise to align b field like the B field generated by the coil will be in the mu direction and at equilibrium
yeah but the equation is t = mu x B right so the torque on the loop goes into the page how does that tell you it goes clockwise do you knwo what i mean like there has to be an axis for the torque to exert on and im confused what it is also can u help on this one	torque is what makes the loop rotate like the spinning of the loop
wait i knoww	not like the flat on page turning it doesn't have to do with the alignment well it does but like the torque is in on the right and out on the left so the force will be rotating wait i'm not sure now
wait what im so confused wait first of all which question are yo talking about	this is the picture i'm looking at rn for the second one u just asked me
isnt the second one gonna try to align w b so it rotates to the right but that was wrong	i think it has both a torque and a force but i can't remember why how manhy more guessed do u have i can check my answer
okay i just got it i had 1 LOL	bro you're risky
pnr	be like that
i still do not comprehend how to make sense of the torque equation	ok so the torque equation has nothing to do with the movement of that coil int eh clockwise direction i think well actually that may be a lie dude why are u thinking of this using math
oh wait uhh lemme think	also your formula may be wrong
wait it was literally the one daddy gave us	unless it's the same thing oh f lmao
i think its the same just w a cross prod	well some of the equations are more useful in certain cases well what is mu
the dipole moment like the red arrow in your pics oh wait i think i understand now torque isnt the direction it rotates in	isn't i x b the direction it rotates in i x b gives u like
i hat or I	current
oh yeah bc force = I x b right	yeah
yahh	idrk what torque means
okay yeah torque is like weird	nice
yeh :D bro i cant	u always confuse me lmao i'm not that good at physics i just
the little green checkmarks are getting harder and harder to get	kind of muddle through everything cuz it seems legit lol sorry bb
:( issokay they said they were gonna make psets shorter but its still 6 questions..	ok i remember what torque stands for now 6 isn't so bad compare to te last one so torque is typically caculated as a magnitude and it's just a representation of how something rotates by giving a vector in the perpendicular direction if you stick your thumb in the directio nof torque for right hand rule your object rotates in the direction your fingers curl
yeahhh thats what i realized just now too	so u can calculate torque to be into the page yeah f
/ re-remembered wow	lmao
im so disappointed in myself lol	physics just never gets easier
i completely forgot what a dot product was for 10 minutes and had to look a bunch of stuff up im so sad	eek it's been a hot second
this sequence has taken me over an hour and im not done	i actually haven't done like math math are u watching the videos
yeah	that's the move honestly
no you seem to understand better than me i think the videos ar emaking me confused	my physics teacher in hs was a god and we did for a full year not just a semester i slept through half the class second semester and still learned more than i am rn lmfao also he just got divorced i think which is super sad
omg LOLOL aghhh can you help again :(	i think it translates towards i1 it's like the iA x B formula i believe
second to last ?	yes
i think i already tried but ill try again oh wait nvm that was right	boi u scared me for a second
ahhh thanks ahhaahha	lmao
i lost track of what i submitted i swear i probably put the same one twice	eek
omg youre on my logs calls now :D yay for seeing your cute face more!	aren't we calling at 9 :DD i am on logs calls now cutie patootie
oh really okayy wait i need to eat dinner and exercise fook	well idk lol
oh okie	i put it on the calendar but doesn't matter
oh what did you say was your fav quarantine activity again	Bookclubyeet
ohh	bro wait for me why u working on 006
lol im stressed about it	stoppppppp me too but i haven't done shit
LOL do it now w me 1 and 2 are ezpz	no i'm paying attention in thie LOGS meeting
why not do both :D	technically i'm trying to read my textbook for 9.00
oh sad	"technically"""
jamei how do i leave without being rood lol	wait same lmfoa
ez	dinner was the mov
HAHA you should say the same	as everybody took thier exodus i snuck out as i was waving
haahha nice im on chapter 6 :D lets see if i can catch up lol	Yesssss did u do 5-2 with some modified ver of full dfs
i said for each plant, use bfs or dfs to count the number of buildings its connected and return the building w the max #	well that wouldn't take O(n^4) time then that would take O(n^5) because the max number of edges is O(n^4) and then if eveery power plant is connected to n^4 edges
yeah	running dfs takes O(n^4) per plant
bfs and dfs take O(|V|+|E|)	that's full DFS which says that if a node is already visited don't visit it any more but that places a constraint on how u can return the max without revisiting edges so you'd have to hash building nodes to the length of their own DFSs if they're not visited before and if they are visited pull their hash length/path from the dfs
wait did we learn memoization	also for 3 did you do dfs alternating between odd and even numbered nodes not exactly but u have to do that right
uh hm i guess? did u ask alex	no i'm asking you lol
oh ben jianna thomas and i all did it this way lol but i can see why its wrong	u mean like just running pure DFS for each power plant?
hahah yeah whoop	because it's entirely possible that every single DFS will traverse n^4 edges right
yeah	F ok well does my answer for 3 sound correct
also for #3 i said you assign the first person to a room, and then assign all its neighbors to the other room, and keep doing it until you try to assign someone a room that is the opposite of what they were already assigned which is the same as yours i think?	oh
but i was thinking of using sets	yep yeah like if it's neighbors should always go in the other the way to keep track of it i thought was to use like odd and even
like assign each a number?	because running DFS doesn't tell u anything about your ancestors
0 or 1 or sum	so like if i recursively call DFS i should call it with some odd or even parameter so it knows which set to assign it to
yeah	i used sets as well
oh ok	yeah ok that soounds right
did u do 4	i'm about to start it
ok lets check after?	yeah how far are you
on 4? or pset	like pset
i think i got 4	ok
i have a small idea for 5 but not sure	ok cool
and working on 6 rn feeling: lost	this is going faster than i anticipate d but it probably gets harder lmfao
wait no its generally just create a graph and then run bfs or dfs on it like we really havent learned anything else LOL or maybe im just doing all these wrong idk	eek ok so for 4 there are multiple starting points right so how do u ensure the BFS runtim
i said you treat the entire euphris as one source node and the tigrates as one destination node	oh huh
this is my alg	yes i think that makes sense
yey u read it that quicc?	no the first part
oh lol	i don't understand why you're doing dfs on the farms you can just go over all the intersections iteratively in O(n^2) time like to formt he adjacency dict u don't need to do dfs
oh but how do you keep track of the nodes	i'm really confused about what the purpose of the dfs is actually
its just to construct the graph	you can just make an adjacency dict well if you're constructing a graph using a dfs that means u already know what edges are adjacent to it and it's a redundant operation? like the graph exists in your mind right the adjacency dict represents a graph
whats the diff from an adjacency list	what what is what different also i think i have a tentative solution to 5
whats the diff between an adjacency dict and adjacency list	there's no such thing as an adjacency list are u thinking of matrix a dict maps nodes to a list of neighbors
what yeah	a matrix uses a list of lists to keep track of where edges exist and there are spots that exist in the matrix where no edge exists but a dict only keeps track edges that exist anything not in the dict doesn't have an edge
o got it im confused how you construct the dict though	you just iterate through all edges
like are you labeling the nodes w a number	sure whatever way such that every node is unique they probably come labveled
ok then when you see a new node how do you know if youve seen it or not	you keep a separate visited set as u traverse
but like youre assigning a name to the node as you go right	uh what
or nah	i mean
im confuzzled lol	if you're going then the nodes already have names presumbly
oh	traversing is different from making a adjacency dict you always make the dict beofre u even start traversing and you can't make a dict if u hae no way to differentiate nodes otherwise how could the problem be presentable the problem can't be like oh there's an edge between some random node and another random node
so in #4	there's some way to identify them
are we identifying nodes by their coords or something	yeah u can do that or just label them all
uh ok	like node 1 node 2 etc etc have u done 6 yet
then you first have to go through and label them before you create the dict? and no i didnt know how :( idk if my 5 is correct either	i guess u can do that for 4 yeah if you're laveling by coordinates it's not really necessary
yeah ok makes sense now do you wanna call real quick to dicuss 5 and 6	sure give me one sec
yay i get to see ur cute face wya	whyat's the pswd
6006algFTW omg hi	hi bb thanks
woah ben and i thought for 4 the path connects farms not goes between wtf this is so much worse	? What about 4 What is 4 again
ben said eq said oh the rivers	Yeah it's Along edges Not through squades
dude eq initially told ben it was through fooooook	Why do we trust eq
this is harder	It's the same thing
same reason we trust alex chen we are desperate	The edges are also n^2 And so are the intersections It's basically the same thing
ugh is it so a node is an intersection now ? wait yes that makes sense	Yah
pOOOOO	Agree
have you looked at the code for 6 the target coordinates in the test cases dont make sense with their answers wait am i just dumb yes i am just dumb never mind for #3 do we just assume we can find pair in constant time	hi yes i haven't looked at the code yet did u do it is it hard what's 3 again sorry is that the power plants
it seems doable? they wrote the move functions for you	oh bless havee u finished it
nope havent started but i think its doable LOL question though	yeah
does python have queues	what's up u can simulate a queue with a list a queue is just a spec what does 006 call it the word for a spec a data structure a list can be an implementation of such a data structure
oh okay would a linked list be more efficient or does it not matter also you know how you were confused about the run time when we code it we can just do a normal bfs like we were talking about right	uhhhh linked lists are more complex to implement in python but i'm not sure yes i think so
oh okay yeah	lmk when u have it done tho so u can come be my savior
hahaha will do how am i still struggling w python syntax it’s been long enough smh	:(( it could be worse right
u right i can do those this!	 
aye i go tit wait lemme put it on alg o man only passed 68% on alg does this mean my runtime is bad :(	Yes Most likely Haha
fook lol nO	Lmao we can work on it tomorrow together
isnt it just a bfs like theres nothing special i had to do	Huh I guess yeah Maybe you're returning too late Or you're not popping off the queue in the right way
hm maybe some paths are infinite i do have a visited set though so hm	Im gonna sleep now But Let's talk about this tmrw
okayy goodnight <3 sleep tight	Thanks bb Go to sleep soon too
oh it works now	What did u change
wtf i literally didnt change anything except putting some repeated code in a function lol wut ok ill take it	Perhaps the code checker isn't being strict enough F
*W	Oh I guess so You're right
LOL	It's a dub Well take i5
ok gngn go to sleep	I said I would sleep lmao But I'm still awake
LOL	I'm gonna sleep now
dude	Fr
you have no business telling me to go to bed when youre still awake three hours ahead	It's your bedtime bro This is mine
das true im going to sleep now hahahaahhaha	LOL Gngn
<3 for #2 theres no need to memoiz right bc buildings are only connected to one plant?	Yes
sicc thas what i like to hear	haha yeha thank
would the runtime be n+n^4 then? rather than n+n^2+n^4	yep
bc were only guaranteed to visit all the plants okay yey	u can also justify this using a supernode
? how the plants are separate for 6b why is the number of predecessors a lower bound?	did u solve it recursively it's just saying like that's a least how many u have it can't be upper bounded right because then it's possible for u to have less than that many predecessors when in reality there's always n^s predecessors at least my question was about the code for #6 btw jk we're good
sorry i was workouting i used bfs wait how can there be more than n^s i can only understand it being an upper bound LOL	Just because there can't be more doesn't mean there can be less Realistically it's more like theta
hm but obv not all n^s are possible predecessors how could there be more	They all are possible It's asymptotic
oh right	Its not saying there's always exactly
how can there be more than n^s	It's like this ishow it grows
there aren’t even that many squares	There can't really be Kts theta
okay hm ok whatevs i’ll just bs the explanation did you get the code working	Yeah
yeY	It was just some optimization thing
i didn’t end up optimizing anything :(( is that needed for the alg in 6c	No it was just like I was adding to the visited set at the wrong point
ah okay how is it the runtime that they want though	I'm calling Jianna in a bit to work on the pset I can also go over that We need to talk about 5 tho
oh can i join lol	Yeah It was an invite lol
how bit is a bit	Like I told her 8pm edt
oh thats rn	But she hasn't bugged me yet So probably 830 I'm dinnering rn
ok i might go for a run? oh okay	Sure
wait yeah i also dont know 5	Eek
she tried explaning but i dont understand how hers works	Jianna's?
yeah she said duplicate the graph for every possible state	I haven't written it out But
but idk how that works for the keys	Yes Essentially
ok ill think ab it	Yeah I have some confusion as well
wait i am about to dinner is it okay if we start later it’s ok if not i’ll just catch up later	u can just join later i promised myself i'd stop by 930 so i could spend some time w family
is book club worth going to if i’m on chapter 16	I think so
what do they talk about	Confusing things
is it like english class lol	From the story
no at book club oh	Yeah
okay i’ll just leave when they get past what i’ve read? isn’t it up to chapter 25 today lol	Oh no clue
do you understand the quiz solutions for #7 ?	Uh I haven't even looked yet I was going to wallow for a few more says days
hahahaha ok lmk when u do im confusedddd	"are u gonna ""go"" to the spring career fair tmrw"
omg is that tomororw does it say which companies will be there	yeah on the website but idk if i should do it or not bc most of them are looking for full time
hm yeah i prob wont too lazy	F
are u gonna go?	Mayb I'm trolling at some point Ain't nobody gonna employ me
HAAHAH ten cent and smurph	:( Bye-bye job offers
rip this sucks bro	How is Amsterdam going
everyone’s summers b ruined uh idk not good though my fam cancelled europe trip	Nooooo Any refunds Yeah literally lmao
i think everythings refundable? or at least for credit dude i read up to ch 27 and ive concluded that ye wenjie is 100% a crazy ass bitch	yesssss i'm so glad you're there have u gotten to the narrative about the people on trisolaris yet and the communications from the ship
i don’t think so? but she’s craYZ bruh this 802 sequence is so ong long	LOL ikr i just did the graded questions this time fuck them other ones
where alex :((	:D
oh wait nvm theres our boy!	;) i am so pooped today and i have lab tmrw morning at 930am
:( why u pooped	i got up at an insane 1030 this morning
:O woah	ik
thats impressive	too early
when u sleep	like 3 330
you sleep at the same time as me!	lol damn it's gonna be a long day today and tomorrow too
sad :( whys that?	we have the hack meeting until 1030 and then i have an interview at 11pm for misti china lmfao the whole thing is a waste of time but whatever
hacks until 10:30 today? rip also whaat are you gonna be allowed to go? if mistis are cancelled	misti technically is cancelled idk why sean is sitll planning things the emergency meeting is 930 to 1030
hm seans a real one justin emailed me today tryign to make sure i wasnt still tryna go this summer have you looked at 006 pset	LOL Nope
dude can you remind me	Trynakeep u safe
how to do things w got git is it pull from master first and then i can edit on local?	uhhh git clone to local
bro i finished the book wtf ye wenjie should be aSHAMED of what she did >:(	I KNOW The last line Sunset for humanity Bigggggg feels join our call
oh fuc sorry i forgot i’m in charge of dinner tonight i’ll try to hop on after?	Ooooiiii Yes
COEM TO BOOK CLUB HEHE	Oh f I totally forgot I just came outside for a bit tho
hop on rn lol	Is it still going
yeah hi momma fu!	Lmao she didn't know I was calling
lol how cold is it in michigan youre wearing so much more than at school	i signed up to do the panel w u lmao
AYE	so did anjalie
LOL sicc we get to give them the same perspective HAHAH	;)))
heyo 	what's up
are the slides blank for you too these are mohameds review slides	you have to download it
omg LMFAO	it's written drawing so it doesn't appear on the preview
ohohoh okay hahaha sad	i'm about to take it around 430pm
oh im doing it 2pm my time	that's about the same thing aye let's not talk about it after though bc it'll be sad if i don't do well i'm not studying anymore tho fuck this shit
wait but dont you see right away if you got it right or not also youre going to be 100% fine i already know jamie u goon	yes :(
LOL SCREAM THE 802 SEQUENCES ARE SO LONG	oh shit really i haven't done the one due tomorrow yet f i just used both of my attempts for one question because i didn't read carefully i hate myself
noooo also did they send the link for the cpw thing tomrorow?	not yet i actually got switched to hosting it so be prepared for some spicy questions jk we're supposed to get guuidelines but i haven't gotten those yet either i'll also be volunteering at jeoparty next thursday so hop on
dang u racking up them housing points	;))) i'm ready to live a biggggg maseeh life
LOL and im gonna be stuck in a quad again	specifically 6051 this time
with 5 less square feet	U bet
sorry do u still have question?	i'll watch lec first lmao have u started studying for the quiz yet i haven't even begun to think about it
dude ijust started today i looked at a practice test and hard im really sad i thought this unit would be easy bc you just duplicate and then choose an alg but nO have u finished 802 yet	was it just graphs oh f really like fps?
yeah just graphs but a lot of the questions required like an understanding of graph theory idk if its bc its from a different year or if ours will be same no the sequences lol why are these sequences so hard wtf	the ones for tmrw? i skipped all the ungraded stuff lol
oh lol i just dont understand anything jamie i can only be at hacc for the first hour	F ok
for all pairs sp can we just create a supernode connected to all the vertices and run bellman ford?	I think u should just run johnsons
but do you think its possible to use bf	no bellman ford won't give u all paths it's single source shortest path to all others
but a supernode will be connected to all vertices	yes but the single source shortest path from a supernode to any of the other vertices will either be the weight of edge from the supernode to all other vertices or negative and that doesnt find alpsp apsp because it's only from supernode to other vertices
oh big dummy yeah okay thanks haha sorry i had to go my mom needed help w something	aw ok
alex chens gf comes to every one of his zoom sessions	Yeah I know it's so fucking cute
oh wait shes assking questions in the chat is she a student lol	Wait no way lol
im confused	I was really confused when j saw that too
LOLOL maybe its another rachel zhang	Maybe she's helping him out
oh hmm im on travel r i p i dont remember if i even put it as a pref saDdddd	i don't think u did but rip it'll be a good experience also let's pick sometime to meet up after 006 for opening/closing and we can go through the stuff
gonna have to reply to so many emails lmfaooo unless we’re virtual! xdxd and okayy	you'll be the big girl in the room tho i look forward toall your email s\ 3pm edt thursday?
bruh no im so sad lol and can we do 3:30 edt i have acting lol	Until 330? Rip that works too but im calling Mindy at 4 so we'll have to zoom through it
ok wait actually 12 shoudl be fine also im sad we have 802 sequences tomorrow i thought it was supposed to be a holidy do they not care about patriotism :(	Aight cool lol I thought it wasn't due until the 21st I did s1 and 2 Can help if needed Havent do e 3 and 4 yet tho
oh what whY do you do this to me why are you so on top of 802	Did it last week bc I have a lot of stuff due Tuesday plus quiz Usually I'm behind on 8.02 Also I need help w the pset lol I haven't even started yet Waiting for u to pull through
lol wait it was really easy and answers online too wait you did this weeks sequences last week?! brOOO	Oh nice lol No wait I did it like friday Cuz I'm hosed until Wednesday lol
oh lol 036 and 900?	Yeah and yeah 9.00 is less of a big deal But even tho I looked up all the answers on the last exam I got like 4 wrong f
f wait yeah lmk if you need my 802 answers i dont have them w me rn	Okie
can u help me w 802 :( sequence 2 question 2b	shit is the pset due tomorrow
wait nvm i got it	oh ok
also idk lol	cool
uh	i think it is f i have to do it i've been on oh all day i haven't even studied yet
for 004? oh i mean	yeah
oh dang :( i think youre going to be fine on 006 though !! u a smarty	doub tit
tit 6006 hehe	Can u Not
okayy	Lmao
i dont understand differential equations this 802 sequence is going terribly	I'm going to start 8.02 in a bit plez help
pset? ok	Yus
wait what the ans for 3d on sequence 2?	Send pic I'm on the toilet rn
WAIT i think i can do it LOL pooping???	No Lol Ok Gl
u too	can u send me 3d i'm so confuse
wait i had no idea i just looked up the answers like i actually dont understand what it means	omg thanks ly
didn’t get ring comm :((( everything at mit is so difficult to get into	:(((( nooooooo you're so worth it
i’m actually really sad lmaooo i got too invested smh	nooooo bbb you were too good for them fuck them
hahahah me@every club that’s rejected me LMAO	lol naw bro just fuckem elitists
skilllab emailed saying we’re gonna be remote i’m so sad	Nooo bb Remote is better than nothing tho right????
yeahh ur right	it'lll be ok i'm sure it'll still be fun!!
"""it could be worse"" has become the daily mantra"	fr tho :( claire can we shorten our meeting to 3-3:30 i just proposed a new time also wya
oh one hour was just the default it shouldn’t take that long right	yeah should be good
and it’s my sisters bday i told justin	ohhhhh bro happy birthday to your sister tell joy i said happy bday
hahah she says thanks jamie lele’s colliding 	Oh shoot your sisters name is lele too ;D
oh did i not tell u lol	I think u did I just
that’s why her name is joy lolol	Forget momentarily Oh
HAHA	My name isnt joy
yeah wtf is jamie	Is her full Chinese name dong lele then Or is just A nickname
hahah nickname	OK cool
 dude in the three body problem how do their interpreters work like how did they translate the alien language to english and vice versa	It must be some complicated version of some Caesar cipher decoder Most languages have patterns so if u run some pattern recognition u might be able to get the gist
thats so wack what if the aliens are just anatomically built different and dont even communicate with sound the same way as we do or like idek it seems so handwavy	Yeah probably It's scifi Wooooo
have you done sequence 3 #1 lol out of attempts nvm i took the risk lol did u get seq 3 1d nvm i risked it again and got it wrong this time hahaha	Omg Sorry I was taking a hackerrank Lmk if u still need
can u help on this one	2 the video has the formula
oh hm tyty	ye accept my time proposal claireeee for the calendar event tmr tytyt
have you done the last two parts on the second question of fps *last part now	lmao fuck no i haven't i haven't even started i took a glance seems complicated will need your help
loll okayy i cant get the last part though but ill help u with the rest	okie ly go/zoom? i finished the fps what's the part u need help on
last one of #2 i was thinkin the energy for either one would be half of the amplitude so Q_0^2/C	yeah i mean u need to find the current tho it's q^2/2c tho
yeah so you use u = 1/2LI^2	because half the energy in the inductor
the total energy is q^2/2c right	so like 1/2*L*I^2 = q^2/4c
oh what	because originally it's q^2/2c right that's the energy intiially
oh my fucking god	or total
i why did i multiply by 2 gaaahhhahahshasfdkl	oh lol
yike ok thank	ye
for the pizza problem on 006 do you take care of the first choice as its own case	sort of i include it in my relation but it's just like an if statement right
oh gotcha	Ye
how did you deal with the fact that the indices arent consecutive from 2n to 1	uh aren't they? a_1 to a_2n
wait i mean like the numbers reset at 2n so like sometimes your start angle will be bigger than your end angle and sometimes it will be smaller	you just have to go around clockwise counter*
so its just like weird to work with the indices oh ok	uh yeah basically
also for #5 can i match ideas w you	mmhm yeah
idk if that makes sense but	uh why prev day it's not what i have rn but
wait sorry ignore the prev day its at that price in that day basically the relation is that if you're at the first price you look at the previous day	oh
and if youre not then you look at the prices in your day	how can u do that
does htat make snese? wym u have indicies	lilke look at the previous day or your day
theyre given to you in chron order so you use indices like one for day and one for price	but if i'm at i i'm looking ahead or behind me depending on whether i'm the first element or not?
no you always look behind	then why does it matter if i'm the first day or not first price of the day
wait bc youre either looking to add onto the previous day or add onto prices in the current day depending on if youre the first price or not they give you the prices like this{pkj , . . . , pkj+k−1} so j is the index for which day youre on and the constant at the end is which price on day j	yeah ik but what does this mean like if i'm already at index i i should have found everything in my previous day's longest increasing subsequence ow or are u going down backwards and how do i guarantee that i've included one price per day and what if i don't want to include index i
im going backwards i think? im not really sure what ur saying	like what does the i represent like am i trying to include the price at that i or am i not
the ith price wait i need to think about this more	lol alright
wait i just went to office hours for 4 and 5 do you want me to explain	Sure I think I have 4 down but 3xplain 5 to me? I have something down but I'm not sure if it's correct
okay messenger or zoom	Wanna do after rec actually I'm outside rn In my backyard
:OOOO	For the first time in 2 weeks
wait idk if i can after rec i was gonna call vincent to break up LOL	WTF
yike anywyas	wait why R y'all ok Ok Not my business But
wait no its okay	Lmk if u need to talk
:(( its just like i feel like i care a lot more than he does like he takes forever to reply and its always me texting or calling first and im so done	Oh I see Have u talked to him about like
he literally	Tgis
didnt text back for 5 days whats tgis lol	Thia This I feel like 5 days is wrong
YES thank u HAHA	But maybe He's actually just like Dense
it was a prob during iap too but we werent that serious yet so it was like eh whatever i can look p;ast it but like	Eek yeah he was like ldr is hard but Idk if he's putting effort in
i feel like if you care about someone it should come naturally to want to talk to them yaknow shouldnt be something you have to actively try on	Right How is he when he responds
so like idek if theres a point on talking about it and trying to fix things i mean like hes fine but theres such a lag that we dont have any meaningful or real convos	Yeah What were the things u liked about him initially
ugh:(( i feel like hes a genuinely good person but hes done a lot of things to make me sad wihtout realizing but like his intentions are never bad i was talking to sophia chen and she just broke up with her bf and he genuinely seemed like a dick but also i feel like now that we're physcially apart the emotional connection was just never really there like our convos are not that interesting compared to w my friends bc i feel like we're just really different	Hmmmm Ok If his intentions aren't bad Have u told him he's made you sad before Idk if you're realizing that the connection isn't there tho Maybe it's for the best
lol yeah i have yeah like i really dont want to but i feel like if we just keep doing this itll keep being a problem and ill just be sad all the time LOL also i havent decided if im gonna for sure agh idk what to do also for #4 i think we missed something idk if you guys talked about it yesterday	Like that it has to be proper? Yeah if it's proper it makes the problem easier right Yeah rip ok U do what u do feel is best
wait really i feel like its more complicated bc now you have to consider prefix and suffix sums from a given angle and lol yah :(( fook	wdym prefix and suffix sums? like if u have a proper angle u just take what is left of it or like counterclockwise until the end of your original bound
lol no proper actually means	so all bounds go from some start and end angle
like you can pick an angle thats not adjancent to any slices bc the definition is that as long as the line from that angle through the entire pizza is adjacent to a slice its proper	uh it says through the center but i don't think it means throught the neitre pizza also i don't think it makes a difference because such an angle can typically be transformed into something within your bounds
thats what they said at OH though	i mean does it even make a difference because there's only so many ways u can eat part of the leftover pizza so as long as u account for that it's chill
hm okay i think its a lil different	wait what would be different then also i think maybe u misunderstood because the angle that they labeled as not proper here the slice through the center goes to the other side right and that one is adjacent to a pizza slice but it's not proper also i see how it would be a little different if those slices were counted as proper but i feel like they shouldn't be
oh wait now im confused the description and the picture are contradictory	i don't think by goes through the center it means goes through the entire pizza i think it just means an angle from the center and not from some arbitrary point inside the pizza
brooo but that is what louisa said sad okay ill ask alex chen	lol just ask him rn
jamie my vscode broke lol do you think you can help me fix when u get the chance	Yeah I'm watching Ford v ferrari Rn But I can help u after what's up
nvm i fixed it lolol	oh what was it
i just restarted it again  and again	the indexing?
HAHAH	sorry the tabbing i meant oh that works too
yeah and the linting	i notice on the code templates they give us is wrong for formatting
also sorry do you still need help on 5 lol oh rlly	no i'm good i figured it out yeah they always use these massive tabs u can reset it tho /fix it
yeah i think i figured out how to  im so confused now	oh wtf did u ask alex
yeah he said the thing from oh is right like the diameter vs radial slice but that’s so confusing bc the pset picture is literally the radial interp	so if it's proper that just means that you'll consume at least part of it with a slice yeah also why isn't the other one proper then here's my writeup for 4 after clarification
WOAH HOWD YOU DO THE VRAKEYS BRAKEYS	LOL
BRACKETS	i found it online
THAS SO COOL	"$T(x, y, Lie) = \min
\left\{
\begin{tabular}{@{}l@{}}
    $T(a_i+\pi,a_i,\text{Liza})$ if $y-x > \pi$ \\
    $T(a_i+\pi,y,\text{Liza})$ if $a_i$ not between $x$ and $y$ \\
    $T(x,a_i,\text{Liza})$ otherwise \\
    for all proper slices in a pizza pie state
\end{tabular}
\right\}$"
can u send me the code omg	if u want it
	haha
is this radial or diameter interpretation	diameter what the piazza post said i just modified it now
oh okay i’ll read it more closely later	yeah
do you mind looking over my #3?	yeah sure i can look after beginners meeting tn
thankss also is it ok if i dont go to beginners mtg i feel poopy	yeah and yeah u doing ok
yeah i’m okayy just don’t really feel like doing anything	:( did it end badly
not really actually i just didnt think i would be this sad lol have you done 802	Like the pset? Uh definitely not Sorry bb
i have no motivation to do it lol ugh i dont understand anything	Oh rip same what am I gonna do now
idk lol we're stranded sophia was my plug when i couldnt do it but shes not doing well rn lol ok i did everything but 1 and 2f,g	Queen
send monkey bread pics	will do later i have an interview at 9pm it kind of turned out like shit
ooh good luck what for did u make the bread yourself	haha it's for some research position in taiwan but i'm not going i have a urop for the summer already
oh woOO are all urops remote	yeah also can u help me with the pset i'm completely lost jk i did 1 i'll let u know how the rest go
oh wait i couldn’t get 1	oh great i haven't done the rest let's trade
lol ok gold on though i just woke up	yeah i'm still doing oh so we gucci :oo that is indeed my flaw oh shit let me send a pic of 1
wait issok i got it	bruh i feel like a leech let me help u OMG why whyyyyy whyyyyyyyyy
such a stupid question lol everything was the same answer wait no its okay lol anjalie sent it to me a bit ago	rip i couldn't even do it at first RIP riperoni
me too so i gave up im impressed you actually got it	dude i had to do an integral and shit it was so fucking confusing rip anjalie did not respond to my plea for help today
LOOl what subject	8.02 bro 8.02
lol sadd maybe she hadnt done the question you were asking about have yuo done this on the learning sequence	was asking about 1 also no i haven't done the sequences yet fuck i just started any suggestions for this one i just used 2/3
2	wat why
bc its by how much E is encapsulated	thank u savior
lol i also was out of attempts but i just went for it lol who cares anymore	isn't it pir^2 for encapsulated e tho ok whatever idc
uhhh wait good question idk oh bc the circumference on the other side	ah u mean like 2pir for distance from center
yeah i cant wait for school to be over	f me too did u figure out the one from above btw i'm stuck on it now too
2 and 6	:oooo dude does this make sense to you i'm getting to the limit of my physics knowledge we didn't learn this in hs
lol i didnt learn any of 802 in hs ;(	:(( sorry bb also r u doing ok
i havent cried today! so yes i am doing good	oh
HAHAh	that's no bueno as in prior days no bueno
LOL issokay	that LOL was FAKE
no i actually laughed out loud lol	oh thats good
idk if it was a mistake though idk mannnNNnnNnnn	u did it so no regerts and i think everyone always feels bad after making a decision don't settle just because you miss smth
ok yes ur right also do you mind hopping on sequence 2 #1 and trying d for me	LOL yeah one sec it's d dunno why
okay cool	but thanks for the free answer bb
idk why either hahah	:DD i'm gonna go eat dinner but i'll probably have to learn this week's material f
hahah okayy tell the fam hello	Yahhh
holy crap i got a 30 lmfao i actually thought it went pretty well	Wait what is this 006
yeah quiz 2 grades	This sucks
time for my daily cry	Oh no
hey jamie im a lil confused on #4 is the relation x(i, j)  = max {x(i, k), x(k+1, j)}	ummmm i don't think so oh wait yes it's the sum tho between those two
sorry yeah	for all k yeah
wait but then when do you account for f(w) base case? and also in that case our relation can just be x(i) right?	what i mean if you're at one character left so i == j then you can't split it any further
but a word isnt necessarily only one character long so would the relation be max{x(i, k) +x(k+1, j),	well u can choose not to put a space too so you try all k options for spaces and try not putting a space and take the max of those oh i see what you're saying
i think we also need to add f(l[i:k] + x(k+1, j) and x(i, k) + f(l[k+1, j] ?	dude i don't understand what these letters mean
lol okay so if the first half is a word and the second half is the subprob first half is a subprob and second half is a word and if both halves are subprobs	well u don't need to do that because if in your subproblem you account for not adding a spac then that entire subproblem will become a word so like u have n+1 options per sub problem you either add a space in n locations
oh right	or you doon't add a space at all and just pull the value so when you make smaller subporblems its teh same thign
yeah okay htat makes snse	ye alex has a 6pm rec right
yeah u not coming to the usual one?	might not
also for #4 we can just use x(i) instead of x(i, j) right will miss ur cute face	no because u have to split the top and bottom
wait wym	when u choose somewhere to put a space u have to restore the left and the right
oh right right	so u hav varying indicies
okay thankk did u do this yet	Yeah U just plug in x - vt For x
oh ah thanks did u do the whole thing	Yeah
can u give me a hint for #3? thomas kinda explained it to me yesterday but there some gaps in my understanding	Yeah Basically you want to process each of the n items by just placing them into one of the subsets And take the max of those options And u can keep track of the current subset sums for the given item you're on
yeah so im a little confused on how you would structure the relation and what the base/original cases would be say we're assigning elements 1 through i so x(i, a, b, c) = min of x(i-1, a+ai, b, c), x(i-1, a, b+ai, c), etc? but that doesnt seem correct	Yep The base case is when you've assigned all elements So u know what the totals are for each one Then u just take the maximum of each of the 4 subset sums And propagate that back up I'll explain more tmrw
wait but what exactly are we defining our subprob as oh yeah its late go to bedddddd	Haha I have lab tmrw otherwise I'd stay up w u a bit longer But your subproblem is just basically when you i through n elements left So when you have no elements left to assign that's the baee Gnnn
im just confused what the value of x(i, a, b, c) is like usually how its the max over a given interval but its not clear to me what it is for this you dont have to reply to me lol im just okay nvm ill talk to u tomorrow haha	The value of that call is the max subset sum after you've finished assigning all i through n elements
poo ive been thinking about it for the past half hour and still dont completely understand	so you keep assigning elements to each of your subsets until there's no more left to assign at which point the answer to your assignment is the maximum of those four subsets correct? then you know that for any given subproblem you have four actions u can take, one for each assignmnent to a subproblem subset* each of those subproblems will return the max sum after it's done assigning the rest of the elements too and your job is to minimize that max sum, so you call min on each subproblem
ok i think i kinda understand	if u need me to explain more lmkk
okay thankkk	yee
im gonna go to oh first and if i still dont get it ill hit u up	ok sure have u done pset 11 yet
is that the one due friday	yeah
no sorry lol too early for that	lol all good i figured it out
bruh why are you doing 802 so earllyyyyyyalsdkjfakshfjkashf	i don't really want to study for 006 lol and i haven't started studying for the quiz so i don't like studying in general
yeah but you’re still going to get an a on the test regardless so you don’t need to study	:pp doubt it lol nothing from w13 is on the quiz right
nope im so frustrated why isnt 1d mu_0*r^2/a^2 on the pset	I think you're close What's 1d
:( also i dont really understand future investing either	Oh I think it's 0
oh wtf	Because ther s a resistor putting actual current through it too So they cancwl
whaaat	Wait rip I was not expecting the quiz 3 review to be so hard So I didn't start looking until just now
wait i think it was like unreasonably hard? hopefully or else this test is gonna be so bad can u help a homie out again LOL	U have to find the poynting vector Power over area gives it right I think this was online I didn't know how to do it either
yeah that gives you pressure = 1/c * power * 1/A right	If it's reflecting it's *2
ugh its still incorrect am i just why is the area 4pir^2 is the astronaut a sphere or something oh wait nvm lol	Yeah It's the sun That's a sphere
lmfao whoops hehe	do u want to help with s1 and s2 this week is ti just review the first sequence looks like review
i haven’t done it yet :((	oh rip it's kind of anal i'm trying to do it now
oh man i’ll do it after dev	eek i forgot timezones were a thing i've wasted away the entirety of today
days not over haha our days are pretty much the same we literally go to bed around the same time some days HAHA	oop mistakes are made on the daily over here
oh hell no the second set on sequence 1 looks stupid nvm im being dramatic	oh haha it's tedious
sequence 2 looks dumb	it is
poo did it take long	not too long bit tedious fps goes right off s2 u would be better off doing them together
oh you did fps too	if u figure out the last part on fps q2 lmk yeah
dang	i did most of it excpet for the last part
okay i’ll do it tomorrow prob	but it doesn't have to be right so i gave up it wasn't bad i just wanted to get 8.02 out of the way this week
ah okie cant get the last part either LOL	yeah i tried like lelgit every single frequency
lmfao yeah im confused did you convert to ev too	yeah i like tried everything from .100 to .500 eV
lolol oh well its for credit anyways but we just wont get the little green check :((	i'm kind of over it lol yeah bit sad as long as i don't look at it it's fine
wait this was our last fps / sequence	oh fr? bless
so we missed our last chance at a little green boy D: im devastated	omg
nO	well just ask mohamed
lmfao hes so busy i cant do that to him	did u do the 8.02 mentor program
whats that	it's like the thing dourmashkin announced when we first went virtual you get paired with a TA or smth and they help u with life and 8.02 lol anyways what i'm trying to get at here
oh	is that i signed up for it
do you have one	and preffed tai's old TA and then preffed colleen bc you're most likely to get paired w smone u know already and i got paired with colleen
BIG F	so i've been meeting with her for like 15 min every other week i've been tryna be super chill w her she's nb as a person
u already kno she gon be taking off points from every pset HAHHAH jkjk yeah shes nice	she still has been lol
omg HAHA why remember when she gave us cookies those were so good	i'm about to check now actually i wasn't there bro
oh why dont u ask colleen about fps so we can get that green :D	alright yeah she's been still taking points off my psets damn
lmfao whyyyy tho	dude is she not grading your psets anymore?
idk who grades mine	dude tf
but i only get like one or two points off	oh ok then that's about the same idk the last one was a 92
yeah	and i don't eevn want to know why
"i have no idea why though they just comment like ""great job!"""	yeah that's colleen lol
and im too lazy to download the graded pset oh lolol	yeah i'm not gonna look lol she's so meticulous lol really be looking through my woork crammed on one sheet so i don't have to flip over the page when i scan
dude robert said he needs a 90 on the final to pass lmFAO	LOL what what has this man been doing he could do the psets in like 2 seconds what is he doing
HAHA i wish i could be like him like hes been doing personal projects and stuff i wish i had things i liked to do and an ability to prioritize things so heavily	lol i have no passion like him personall projects sound nice but i'm really just tryna live lol It's super spook My mind has been put into an unrenderable state
omg i don’t want to read it is it like disturbingly scary	No it's not like disturbing where creepy stuff like weird alien shit It's more like Mindfuck despair mindfuck mindfuck despair chilling disturbing
what does that even mean lolol can u give me an example	so sophons have halted the progress of fundamental theory right so science can push the limits of theories of what are already known but cannot experience a technological breakthrough because the sophons are always spying on them they develop smth called the wallfacer project in which 4 people devise plans to defeat trisolaris entirely within their minds and have unlimited resources to do so and everything they say can and usually will be construed as a lie
how does that even work lol hm	it's really strange yeah but it gets stranger also the questions on the problem solving sessions all look really hard it won't be like that hard right
i really hope not alex emphasized just knowing the psets and lecture material really well also he said not to worry about building a wall i literally cant bring myself to study anymore	oh hmm yeah the problem sessions were quite difficult how much did u look at lol cuz i feel like i didn't look at that much but i'm out of energy already
i only did 2 practice tests lol	lol i'm in this limbo phase of being over it again i just want this whole week to be over
i cant even think about dp rn so im trying to let my brain rest but when test time comes my brain will still be in relaxation mode has it been a long week for you	LOL moderately i frontloaded a lot of my work this week so other than finals i have nothing left i frontloaded it so i could study for this damn quiz and now i'm not even doing that i just psne tlike an hour watching pitch perfect clips then moved over to vanderbilt melodores it's been an emotionally long week for me
lmfao we're gonna do fine :DD	:') fingers crossed
lol im optimistic alex said it was reasonable which is good remember how last time he straight up told us it was dummy hard	oh ok good i thought the palindrome one was tricky
:'( im nervous lol i had all day to study and i didnt so this is 100% on me	haha don't we all get nervous before quizzes i'm nervous too lol good luckkk
hhefheoiufjsda u too gonna do mikes breathing exercise real quick	fuckkk i should have tried to get partial cuz my solution was not correct for the second one
for whcih one?	fuck
oh dude idek if i did them right lol	i'm pretty sure i did like all of 2 wrong
whatd u say	it's wrong i said like try to find some m' < m for set A first with no repeats
it was worded really wierd	then try to find the remainder with B and if the reaminder is a multiple of any of the true sums from B it works but that doesn't cover all cases so i'm gonna get a fat zero on that question which sucks because i'm getting docked foro the other ones for sure cuz i wasn't confident about thsoe ones either
i thought since theyre all distinct you just go through all of the numbers in both sets	i concatenated them at first too but it doesn't account for repeats in B at all thats what it means by limited unlimited
but there wont be repeats in b right	no but sequence s can have repeatss from B so like a = 1,2,3 b = 4,5,6 my sequence could be 1,2,3,4,5,6,6,6,6,6 so that's where i went wrong too i couldn't account for the unlimitedness of B without getting the runtime off but i wasn't willing to get partial so i fucked up the entire rest of the question
wait no your sequence will only be made up of at most 2n integers am i understanding the question wrong omg	uh where did they say the sequence would be 2n yeah cuz i was confused about this at first too so i just concatenated them
oh	but it's definitely not right
wait im wrong	because they said that if s is in A then it only appears once but they say nothing about B so if s is in B, it can appear multiple times up to m times in fact
aw mAN	but that would make the sequence nm
jamie why u gotta make me sad	and then the runtime is nm^2 sorry
i thought i did it right HAHAH	i'm sad too it really sucks i couldnt' get it i'm sad
yeah the runtime would be nm^2	last time i solved everything and got a 60 sooooo this time i didn't even solve it
wait othe way around	and i'll probably get a 40
dude 60 is exactly doubl emy score HAHAHAH from last time	:(( rip mediocrity is our vibe
*my 60 is literally an A can we match for #3 im scared now	uhhh i don't want to make myself more sad but ok
what if i also udnerstood it wrong ?	oh u screenshoot that shit?
wait if anything youre gonna make me sad not the other way around HAHAH	yeah that's lik almost exactly what i had i think?
ok sick	you mean j, k are rooms a ad b right your test looks so clean haha mine was an entire shitshow i don't remember if i wrote legible sentences
yeah wait why	i think u forgot to condition the rooms that they be greater than 0 tho like j > 0 and k > 0 before u can assign and n - (i-j-k) > 0
oh like in the base cases?	like in your assignment
oh	in the relation
wait same thing right	oh yes i see your base cases now
im bummed about 2 now	i think it can be any i tho
wow oh shoot u right noOOOoooOoo	:(
1 was just	it's fine it's jsut the base case
text just but with hashing	right but only up to 10
eyeyye okay	so u can still get that nice n -_ m n +m
yum	ok yeah i actually didn't figure that out at first i wasted a bunch of time on that shit
it was such a pain to read wait i dont understand how theres any way you can do #2 in the time bound	anjalie said she did it
we're three tiers of smartness	aw cmon don't say tht
HAHAH so the sp would be x(i, j) true if you can make sum j using a1...ai and any of B	yes like sorta like any of A without repetition and any of B with repetition
wouldn’t we just alter the base cases so that x(0, bi) = true	uh what's bi also yeah i fucked it up you can just do the same relation for B but with repeated elements which makes a fucking idiot because i fucking saw that as an option but dismissed it cuz i thought it violated topo sort which it does not f
sorry B_i	Yeah for any subset sum of B with repeats If that's the base u can return true
yeah okay dang it’s like the split bowling prob	Ubhh Idk Oh yeah sort of Two subproblems necessary
like preconputong yeah	Ugh whatever I don't want to talk about it anymore it's sad
me too how was ur day :D	Alright up until a couple hours ago So nb I'm in my period So that hasn't been fun
aw do you get abs cramps bad*	Eh not really but if I exercise a little it's not very heavy but since I've been doing nothing but eating now
oh LOL relatable	:(
are you gonna do this weeks 802 sequences theyre ungraded but idk if that means theyre optional	Uh it says optional right
wait where mine just says ungraded	oh they must have changed it it said optional a few days back i'm not doing it
yay ok neither shall i then	Haha Yess
sad	LOL I played early too It's not too bad
omg i’m so creepy but justin and his gf broke up :o and they ubfriended each other on fb	Oh jesus They were so cute together tho How do u know this
i know wtf i literally thought they’d get married justin was tagged in a confession i saw and i clicked his profile for some reason and it said single so i stalked both of them	LOL what they update their statuses on fb too damn it must have been not a good breakup
i remember they both used to say in a relationship w __ the other person they also i friended each other i’m shook	aw shit awwww shit it's cuz of justin's new haircut
HAHSJAJSKSJSJAHAHAAH IM CRYING	LMAO sorry i couldn't help myself that was mean i shall never say a mean thing again
LOL UR ALL GOOD it was funnyyynyn	:pp
bruh have you started the 802 practice questions	no lol why i'm still cramming 036 and boutta start 9.00
im so hazy on the last two weeks lol like wtf is a poynting vector good luckkkk are they tomorrow or friday or both i forgot	eek yeah i don't really know both friday
good luck jamie!!! u got this	Thanks claireyboo have u done the practice problems for 8.02
yeah got most of them wrong haha	rip yeah did u feel that they were harder than the lessons and practice i'm on 6 rn and i feel like the stuff in the beginning was like stuff we didn't learn how to derive the last question parts
hm yah they were hard but i wasn’t sure if they were harder than lessons or if it was just bc my understanding of the topics were bad	i tried to ask dave about one of the questions and he started giving me like calculus derivations for it and like usually all we have to do is plug and chug so i'm kind of confused why they were so hard
wait who’s dave lolol also yeah idk i’m gonna rely on mohameds videos to teach me everything i need to know	Oh David David Wu He's in 8.022 I'm gonna go to his review tmrw yeah
aw what an affectionate nickname :)) hahaha i woke up for his session today at 7am and then i saw his email saying he’d record it and i went right back to sleep	LMAO I missed the earlier 006 session today cuz I slept in Was mediocre tho so
wait whaat	Shreyas was gr8 tho
isn’t it in an hour	There was an earlier one today
omg	There's another in an hour
i thought it was tomorrow f aw mamnnnsnsmama	Oh yeah lol it's fine the content is supposed to be repeated
it wasn’t helpful?	They just presented on a bunch of slides
they said they’d cover different practice probs so i was gonna go to both	The most useful part was when shreyas did some problems at the end
aw u gonna go to the next one?	Yeah probably It's Sabrina and Louisa tho And I felt like Louisa wasn't very helpful in OH
oh wait ugh yah louisa is meh was it only shreyas this morn	AJ and priya too AJ was not bad Remember I missed half of it tho Cuz I slept in I was on my phone half the time too It wasn't like uber useful it was like broad overview
o mannnn i love oriya priya big f	Haha she's so enthusiastic I realized recently that I'm not a very helpful LA In 004 Cuz like whenever I start explaining something it takes me like a few minutes to get warmed up and explain it properly So the first few minutes I'm just spewing BS cuz idk either
lmaoo that is false you’re always good at explaining do you know when the 006 final is wait nvm its so early wtf	hi it's 1:30 edt isn't it isn't that just 10:30 for you
lol yes 10:30 is kinda early	yeah agree are u done studying fo 8.02 is there anything else i should study
lol i’m done	also 006 prac final be looking kinda hard what did u study
even though i’m not ready	cuz i feel like i didn't do enough
just his vids and practice probs idrc lol fall19?	yeah the only one i've done so far
shoot that’s the only one i haven’t done dang it	bruh fr how have u studied so much for 006 have u done the last 3 years
i have no other finals lol	just 8.02 and 006? no way
only sp18,19 fall18 chill out i’m still gonna do horrible hahah and you’re still gonna be fine	wait do u know how much of our grade 8.02 is worth final
nope	lol u reallyy don't care about this clas ok i won't bother u anymore then lol good luck good luck
wait no i just think my grade will be fine i also don’t know the percentages of the final for any of my classes lol i’m not a very strategic student	yeah it's definitely fine lol but i alway sjust wanna know either way
do you think the test will actually take 3 hrs	Hopefully not lol don't they usually give us 45 minutes buffer time
hahah i thought for quizzes it was double the time hopefully this will only take 90 min LOLOL	LOL I hope so because I haven't been studying
i cant imagine it taking that long on the practice questions info it said the final will have fewer questions	Yeah I thought it was strange too But maybe they'll be longer questions is what I was thinking
omg what if they all have like parts a-h i will cry	T.T Same
is there general tomorrow?	No
f i couldnt get 3 points it was so unsatisfying to miss my last opportunity at a green checkmark forever	Aw it's OK bb You did wellll Only 3 pts off
omg your twitter banner!	lol wait what is it oh yah i think it's a picture from the walk we took that day
fall photo shoot! was fall 19 really hard for you too like i just stared at it for the last hour bc i couldn’t do any of it :(	Fall 19 was the only one I've done so far I couldn't do a lot of it Was quite hard I didn't get any of the quiz 1 material Graphs and DP were ok
:(( the other ones were easier this made me sad	:( it's OK hopefully it won't be that baf I'm doing sp 19 today and the 18s tmrw
two in one day woooahshdjkeks	Dude piazza has been so dead Neither of my questions have been answered
oh yah LOL it’s not dead on the student side	Don't have enough motivation to do them tosay
but very dead on the responses	Yeah rip This is the most crucial time too
lol true	:D let's get this bread
yeet this wheat	ooh that's a good one i think imma have to pick it up
omg i have so many of these okay i had a phase in hs lemme try to remember all of them	OOOOh
obtain this grain	LOL what kind of PHASE
that is all i can remember	i'm cackling holy shit
idk it was during soccer season	i can
and i would say them before our games	just imagine
sigh	good ol days
high school was somthing else	yeah what a time to be alive my world was this small microcosm of standardized testing, tennis, and school
yeah i really wish i could go back and redo freshman year of college also have you made matcha lattes in quarantine	yeah rip same tho no i wish i don't have any matcha at home so that's the main barrier i'm lowkey getting tired of dalgona coffee
HAHAH do you use a hand mixer	like an electirc one? aw hell nah i been using the whisk every single time gotta put in the work baby
omg what doesnt that take forever	nah it's like 10 minutes i'm used to the pain now
omg lmfao gainz	LOL the only gains in quarantine
i read your medium article again and it made me sad	nooooo T.T more good things are coming our way i'm going to write another one soon i think either about the three body problem or guitar or smth
hahah theres acutally a lot i regret not doing this year i shouldve come into college more prepared have you been playing guitar whaat	rip same i didn't think about school at all until like 3 days before i needed to drive up it was tragic yee i've been practicing like every other day it's not very productive practice but like i can play a lot more chords now so it's great i suck at all songs still but now there's more songs i can suck at
me too man i was so unprepared i was honestly dreading it so i tried not to think about it omg is that why youve been listening to guitar on spotify	OMG YES
HAHAHA	im so glad you've been stalking me too dude that's two people so far that have seen my changing music taste
spotify is my new favorite social media	one of them is guitar and the other is when i have time
ive never used the find friends function until recently	dude hop on our summer project
oh ive only noticed guitar and the chinese songs	david lu alex quach and i are goonna try and make a social spotify
omg ik both of them whats the idea isnt spotify arleady social	oh rip that was last night i was listening to a new album not exactly like we think it's hard to discover new songs quickly making playlists is hard for one
oH WAIT	and you can only see friend's current listening
i agree that its hard to discover songs that i like	so like we want to make a social media platform where you can share and see playlists based off of your taste
oh like	and like i was just thinking the other day
you should be able to see their top artists that would be cool	like we could have like daily status updates or like 30-day challenge that's going around ig too on like what you're listening to rn i think spotify sort of does that but it's not very public
wiat really its also hard to find friends on spotify	yeah if you just click on a person's profiel you can see who they've been listening to recently
they should make it easy to find friends through mutuals *we	agree you have to connect to fb
hm this could be funnnnnn idk web dev tho like at all	it's aight neither do i
shuddup u spectacle head	learning process i'm p sure david lu doesn't know anything either dude i just make the words with my mouth
alright so alex quach carry	oh he knows web dev?
oh wait i thought	i thought he was the mL guy
you were implying that he did	hes really into that LOL nice
ok so no one knows web dev YAY	so we're all incompetent great do you want to be added tho it sounds likeu h ave interest
it would be cool! u should ask them if its ok ?	hahahah ok ok i will
this is such ~mit student vibes~ i want to be good at web dev like kevin fang and just churn out cool little projects	dude same lol if i knew web dev bam bam bam portfolio done my one goal for this summer is to make a personal website i don't have any projects to put on it rip but it's fine
hahahahah make it a personal blog or something	oh good idea yeah and once i have more stuff i can add a tab or smth
i should try to recreate my photo website	iyour photo website is nice
so its not on adobe portfolio im leeching off my sister's adobe creative cloud from berkeley when she graduates in a year its over for me	ah i see lol
LOL	does hack have credits not that i'm suggesting anythign
i dont think os	ah rip you can learn web dev w me aye
robert said he can help me pirate the apps but that seems too sketch for me	oh wait it's actually not that hard i've done it before as well
oh rlly he said it just stops working sometimes and you have to redownload it	but i removed it later and it like left some remaining files that left a tab on my file explorer so that was annoying idk if it'd be better on macs tho
ah i wanna learn photoshop too	i never played around with it that seriously bc it's not on this laptop
i want to learn how to panoramic photography so i can do a cool pic like this when we get back to school	oh is there like a special method to it my phone has like worst camera functions ever so i just make do with whatever i have i do have the canon tho which i'm probably gonna pop out later sometime this summer
ooooh yeah i forgot u photo	wow that looks so good i do it like chill not on manual cuz i struggle with that lol but i feel like sometimes i just imagine something looking very nice if i shoot it from an angle so then i just want to actually take a picture plus idkk how to edit so everything is just like bring the highlights down bring the shadows up
yeah my editing is clicking a preset ahaha	LOL they do look nice tho oh exposure was the other word i was thinking of this is all from that one semester of yearbook i took in my senior spring of hs completely on accident too i didn't get into the genetics class i wanted
LOL yes crank up the exposure and temperature to make it bright and warm das as much as i can do	love it anyways also that post u tagged me in i subsequently got tagged like 3 more times so fucking funny
LOL i saw copycats they are	you're first in my heart <3
huefheuehe <3	Alex said he'd be down to talk to you after Wednesday
okay coolio thank	Welk
can u explain costly campaigning to me i dont understand why j is from 1 to 2k+1	uh is this the final
yeah the elizabeth warren one	im p sure i don't understand that one either
ah okay	oh i do understand this one it's just saying that the distance between any two broadcast downs cant be more than 2k cuz like town ---k towns --- k towns --- town ensures that all these towns get the news but like town -- k towns -- missed town --- k towns -- town doesn't work where j here is like 2k + 1 because the last town was >= 2k+1 towns away does that make sense
oh	also i fully didnt' even like write anything for 2 questions on fa18 RIP
uh kinda hahahah wait same	it's over for me
oh wait fall 18	yeah
i dont remember how that went	i'm checking it rn it's kind of a shitshow
issokay wait sorry i still dont understand they define j as the last town where we ran an ad	yeah
so i thought j should be from 1 to k+1	well like my town spreads the news to k towns in either direction
bc j only covers i from its left side	so it's like k towns - town -- k towns so i can put a town 2k away and it's still chill
but the ad was run k towns away right me ----k towns ----- ad ----- ktowns	i know but i don't have to run another ad right away like ad --- k towns - ad is valid yes but i can also wait until i'm 2k towns away to run another ad like k towns -- ad -- ktowns -- k towns -- ad becuase the next ad i place will also propogate to k towns left and right so it's double like | k - ad - k | - k - ad - k | you can think of it like that
wait yeah i understand but i dont see how this relates to the solution	oh becuase i have to consider all 2k spots after my last ad otherwise i'm being too restrictive by saying that after k towns i must place an ad whereas i don't have to place an add immediately after k towns from my last one i can wait a little longer too so that's why i have to consider 2k options
oh so we couldve run an ad somewhere from 1 to i-1?	"in what case because i can only consider farther options when i'm sort of like ""still within my last ad's reach"""
ad --- k towns --- i ---- ktowns --- ad ? sorry im super confused lol	uhhhh no like the i represents the town i'm currently on so like i have 1 --- i-1 towns here and the last place i ran an add was like 1 --- i-1 --- j towns -- ad like that so if j > 2k + 1 i only have one option so i have to place a town at i-1 or i or whatever the relation says but if j is less than 2k+1 i don't necessarily have to place an ad there and i can consider farther options so i just don't place an ad at i and decrement i by 1 to consider the next town. but by moving to the next town i have to increase j because the distnace from my last ad increases when i move
ugh i still dont get it :( i think i dont understand the format of the subproblem	would it help if i explained it as a suffix cuz i usually understand those better the format of the subproblem though is not too bad it's like at town i i eiether place an ad or i don't right
i usually like prefixes better lol	oh well
yeah	the intuition is still the same yeah so if i'm too far from my last placed ad what am i forced to do at i
are the last placed ads are to the right of i but there could be ads placed to the left of i right	yeah but it's a prefix problem so we're not t there yet the last placed ad is right of i by some distance j
wait if j is greater than k away from i then we have to place an ad at i	greater than 2k remember
yeah ig i dont understand why its 2k bc an ad at j can only reach k to the left of it	yeah but the ad i place can reach k to the right of it too so my ad is here at i right: i --- some distance -- k --- j when i place my ad at i that some distance better be <= k otherwise my ad won't reach all towns between i and j in reality the problem describes it as (i + j) but that's a trivial matter like i to (i+j)
wait but in the solution if j < 2k+1 you dont place an ad at i	yep so if my some distance between last placed town and i is <2k + 1 i don't have to place an ad at i and i can still reach all towns between some later i and j
wait what this is dependent on the fact that youre running an ad at i oh wait so youre saying	yeah if i don't run an ad it's ok if some distance is < k though
if the distance is less than k you can wait to place it later?	yeah
like to the left of i	less than 2k
oh	because you're guaranteed your last town will propogate k to the lef tright
yeahh ok	so you just need to make sure that there's not more than another k on top of that
ok i think i understand now ugh	ok haha that's good
thanks so much	yeee
im sad now lol	this final i just took made me sad too lol
yay we can be sad together	anjalie told me the curve is like 50% tho so like we just need to get over half points for an A hopefully cuz i'm really not hitting more than that rn
oh really hm idk if i can do that also that seems a little too generous i saw on confessions it was higher than half like 130/180 or something? could be remembering wrong tho	oh really? idk anjalie has last year's curve from the course site so
like from prev years oh well idk then lol i guess we'll just have to dO oUR beSt :D	 rip yeah the curve for spring 19 was quite high but fall 19 it was 98 i literally can't do better than this lol
oh LOLOL fall 19 was really hard imo compared to the other three	yeah well i'm not feeling like fall 18 is any easier i've been getting like significant stuff wrong on every question it kind of sucks
oh ugh did you really do two practice tests today	i'm gonna do the second one after i finish checking this one have u calculated what you need on the final
for an a? i would need an a of some sort lol	lol just don't get more than 50 points off
easy when the instructors can post this on piazza but not answer our posts :(	yeah actually what the fuck i saw this and iwas like I still have two AWOL piazza posts hello
HAHAH which one did you vote for i feel like i didnt understand most of the references lol	liza pover
ew that was a terrible problem	she's iconi c it was a terrible problem i would have voted for the hogwarts houses otherwise
i said kiger ting lol	uhg
omg the hogwarts houses stressed me out on quiz 1	really? that was one of the easier ones i thought
yeah hahaha but i was so nervous for quiz 1 and the storyline was kidna distracting	yeah agree also claire i do not want to spend 10k on a virtual concert there's so many people out there doing that for free rn
wait what	for hack lol
are we spending 10k on a virtual concert	dude idk but hannah said u and jack really want to have a virtual concert
oh wait im not like	also i think hannah and jack lowkey have beef rn
adamant it was just something we were tlaking about LOL so i mentioned it in log s OMG WAIT	oh lol cuz she said u were really want it lol
HAHASDFHAJSKDLJFAF	can u actually promise not to spill any tea about this lol
"oh she did YES I PROMISE I HAVE NO ONE TO TELL ANYWAYS ""Yes."" I WAS SCREAMINGNKSGASDFAJ"	yeah they're like consistently not happy with each other's decisions and i think i just got drdagged into it cuz like we just had our chat for logs and she's been asking me a lot of stuff about like what i want to do recently yeah jack has always been too headstrong
hannah is kinda aggressive lol	hannah is like this now cuz jack never agrees with her lol
also yeah jack is a little hard to work w or like when we do speakers he'll ask me for suggestions and ill give some and he'll just shut them down without any explanation and im like o haha ok	yeah idk i can't really do anything about it tho cuz he's still senior director and i don't want to argue more than he already is
this is so funny lol	"but then like hannah told me today she was like ""jack has had his hack this one is your baby"" so i'm curious to see what your ideas are and i was like uh yes like sure i agree but like"
this virtual hack is your baby?	it's not i'm getting a lot of options rn yeah that's what she said
wait are you gonna be director for hack 2021	she was like jessica stepped back last year so jack could have his
im confused	yeah i am
oh wait	but she's like next cycle will be about onboarding the new director is jack onboarding me rn?
oh lol	anyways she was like
why does she care so much hahah	you should share your viewpoints bc general is just like jack and kevin arguing
LOL this is true too	dude i'm like i have no power in this situation both of them have been around longer besides if there's anything i want to do i'll just do it it doesn't have to be me like disagreeing with everything cuz like stuff that i'm thinking are like it's not a big deal but jack wants to do it then i'm like ok that's fine w me i don't want to be overly controlling you know it's not my baby it's our baby
wow you and jack are having a baby :')	idk i haven't felt ambitious lately cuz i don't feel confident in what i want to do in this situation but it is stuff i need to think about ok no it's hack's baby hello
yeah that makes sense theres nothing to be assertive about if you dont have anything that you really want to do	like i feel like i should try to
no its you and jacks' baby	make hack better in some way by the end of this
:)	ugh no idk i think what hannah was trying to say was less like encouraging me to have my own ideas and more like assert your ideas over jack's cuz vibe check like idk i think a lot of peopl ehave this idea that once you're like in charge everything should go your way and really isn't it more about like everything should go smoothly but not necessarily your wa i don't have to come up with all the good ideas i just have to help facilitate them
yeah however the majority of the team sees fit was jack there when she was telling u this lol	oh god no
oh hahaha	it was our one on one
oh gotchu	yeah i think she just wants me to not sit back while they argue anymore but like i really can't do that without getting on either of their bad sides which i'm atively trying to not do
well what would you even say	dude IDEK like
whenever they argue it feels like	i feel like jack sometimes tries to control too much
something they just need to talk out	like do whatever u want man as long as it works they have tried i'm in a gc with just jack and hannah and them arguing while i'm sitting there is just lkke so uncomfortable for me idk i wasn't that stressed about this before but now i'm kind of stressed am i supposed to be doing more as a director rn and like this is really bad timing because i still have 006 tmrw F
i dont think its your place to like vibe check jack especially if you dont think theres a problem?	i mean
like if you were to do what hannah says there would be too many heads butting	i think that like it's not good that they argue but like
also idk if this is supposed to be yOuR bAbY arent you supposed to be learning this hack and leading more next hack	wait yeah that's what i thought but apparently jessica used last hack to let jack do whatever and now this hack is supposed to be mine according to hannah's definition
uh	that's not how i interpreted it
idk i think hannah might be biased bc i heard jack and jessica butted heads a lot	yeah i kind of felt that too but idk i didn't want to get into an argument with hannah plus the meeting was kind of going long so she had to leave so i didn't say anything
LOL	"i said smth like ""i'll think about it"" and like"
i think you dont have to worry too much like if you have ideas you feel strongly about yeah push for them but if not its not a big deal its not your solely job to come up with ideas thats on the whole team youre supposed to sTEER THE SHIP HAHA	lmao thanks for the advice claire i thought that this was sort of how i felt too
seems like hannahs just annoyed w jack and wants someone at his level to check his power but it shouldnt be like that if this is a democRACy	ugh idk she'll think i'm being bad if i don't step up now tho like what does she even mean by step up i legitimately was like why are u telling me what to do
why des it matter what she thinks LOL	"i get it's like friendly experienced advice well it matters because she has to work with jack for a whole summer to get this hack which is supposed to be ""my baby"" upa dn runnign ugh i can't think about this rn let's talk more about this after thank you for being my vent for today tho glad to know someone will love me no matter what <3"
lmfao yeah dont even think about it until after 4:30 pm tomorrow HAHSFDKLAJ	ugh i was looking for that emoji with the big eyes i can't find it eek will do
ily heheh🥺	oh thats the one that's the one i wanted
have you seen the thing mem e	wat meme
"""wtf is 🥺i dont speak bottom"" sorry i was looking for the emojis also im so bad at quiz 1 material wow"	What the hell LMao Damn same
omg did u know alizas transferring to columbia	yeah she told jack and i yesterday rip did sh eannounce it somewhere or smth
yeah on instagram lol	oh rip really ok did she say why
uh she basically said she wasnt happy at mit lol	aw shit ok gr8 that sucks
yah i felt baddd props to her for taking initiative to transfer tho i feel like id just stay and suffer	Yeah Columbia would be better right Or like Is there a particular reason she chose Columbia to transfer to
idk i haven’t talked to her about it :// i think it would be more chill?	Hmm alright Yeah I see
did she tell you guys anything noteowrthy	Nope I don't think so How's the skilllab going
remote lol do you think takig 009 and 046 next sem is a good idea	I know but Is it good so far It's not a bad idea
oh it hasnt started have you heard from urop direct funding also dont most people warn against 006 and 009 together isnt 046 and 009 like the same thing but worse	no f yeah ig but ik a lot of people who took those two together it'll be alright i think since you're already past 006 and you've done some coding it'll be fine
same ;( apparently they aren’t approving many bc there are too many apps	yeah that's what i heard as well it's awful my urop advisor said he'll pay us if direct funding doesnt tho
agh are you sUre	wait
are you taking 046	r u doing a urop this summer too????
yahh i applied	yeah next semester which prof omg big girl keeping busy
same one as rn they’re super chill	ah the car one?
yah	oh nice
i’ve barely done anything for them xd	your urop advisor is a funny lil dude but aren't they expecting full time now
hahahah wait not the one that said the thing about black peoples people that was the lab i dropped and eh nah they’re not using me for anything they’re honestly just like helping me learn which is really nice	aww that's so nice that's awesome actually i wish i had an understanding urop like that also i want a job f i want a paying job but nobody is paying and anywhere else i've applied is not wanting me
wait what’s ur summer urop also tou said they’re paying you right oh wait you mean on top of the urop ah i see	yeah lilke
yah :(( it’s a rough summer for everyone	i'd rather have a job than a urop but like
next summer will be too	it's fine u think so? f we're getting wrecked
hey you can use the time to do stuff you’ve always wanted to do! and learn and 🧚grow and yeah i think a lot of the tech companies have hiring freezes and a lot of seniors are getting their full time jobs revoked so they’ll be looking for jobs too	agree lol no fuckk this sucks this totally sucks
lmfao u know fun and twitter and square told their employees they can work remotely forever if they want companies are realizing that they don’t need the to pay the costs of physical workplaces for the same results	oh yeah i heard about twitter and square i think right but who the hell wants to stay inside their entire life
yeah	how do u develop a life after college lol
i think being around people is important for creativity also just happiness	ugh you're right
this whole thing sucks haha	say it louder for the people in the back lmao
i’m sAAAAFDDDD	yeah rip we just us two are the best at making each other sad rip

i think well at least for me i just emailed people who didnt have postings and a few of them were like hahah yah sure u can just join us	yeah i tried to do that before too but response rate was lower lol
oh i see:( i wish mit had summer classes taking classes is so much easier	wait they do don't they aha i'm not sure yo'd want to take classes 24/7 tho
eh not the relevant classes i wish i could take 009 this summer	U could technically just learn it on your own And then it would be a breeze
don’t the instructors change	Yeah but generally the content is similar The labs*
oh ok omg final grades huuuh	Yuhhh thanks for letting me know
lol bearer of bad news on your bday :( is the table on the bottom your final grade the one that says current standing min grad and max grade	Ahaha all good I did Better than expected So it's good news I suppose How'd u do
omg i did good too im so shocked i thought there would be no way id get an a in the class bc i had a b+ before the final but the final brought me up to an a so im HAPPYY well actually a- but im still happy hehe also we have no hidden grades	Yayyyyy Yeah ik bummer since we tried so hard
wheeeee what about you no reason to have been worried right hahahah eh yeah issokay though	Ababa yah I got an A too Well it would have been like a C- if I hadn't taken the final
omg same hhahahah how the turn tables	Lol clutch Did u see Hannah's slack message
oh what wait i mean yeah but what about it? the one about meeting today?	yeah do we have a timeline she also talked to me about deciding what format we want cermonies to be on cuz like we'll need to present
oh i mean we just have to start writing the script and stuff over the next few months right we can say we’ll have it done by august zoom? youtube live wait i think youtube live	yeah so like we'll youtube live our zoom call?
yeah	ok
oh alizas still here aw	she'll be here for the rest of the summer lol
oh LOL i guess that makes sense dude i dropped a knife on my bare foot before this HAHAH	THE FUCK r u ok lmao
LOL yah i was just spooked how was ur bday	was good ate a lot
ayee cake?	yeahi made myself one with boxed cake mix lol strawberry frosting was not it tho
aw LOL have you opened your packages also have all 3 come yet?	wat there's three what the fuck LOL
how many have arrived	no just the one i haven't opened it yet just the one that tai mentioned my parents aren't letting me
oh f amazon prime is wack rn	yeah i'm gonna wait another day oh really? my parnets have been buying so much stuff with my account do u want to give the update
ehhhh idc	ok u then
cri ok HAHAH jk	speak up boi
jk its fine idcidc i talked to hannah today and she was saying that closing could be done in a few ways depending on if judging is live or not	yeah she mentioned that closing is only important if all judging results are in and if we have like a speaker there
do we usually have speakers at closing	i forget now yeah no speakers
okie hannah also said that we could prerecord all of opening including keynotes	yeah that'd be way easier
but idk if that would seem less interactive	we don't really have a QnA at opening tho right
yeah thats true	no time but now that we're virtual we potentially could do it as webinar format that would be cool
what would be the diff between webinar and youtube live	well you can always watch on youtube live but if u join the webinar then u can ask questions like we livestream the webinar and some people join and some people just watch
oh youtube live also has chat right	yeah it has live chat but if we're calling on zoom it'll be hard to monitor both possible tho
oh wait wouldn’t the hackers only be tuning into the youtube livestream i was thinking zoom would be for us and speakers	Ohhhh I see That works tooo
wait jamie i cant make general tomorrow is dat okie	Aw rip Why they doing this to me Yeah probably
hehe social chairs want to host a bonding can you add this w2m to this coming general go/bonding	aye down
thanks!	:D
could you also add go/questions to mtg for people to fill out? its like the logs-cr bonding questions	"aight ""coolest place you've ever pooped"""
:D can you guess who came up w the questions	i would never be able to guess
yeah idk seems like something jianna would do though	:]]]]
holy splash looks so good	Splash is done? The actual website?
oh no like mkt	Omg you're just seeing it Haha yeah it's lot
yeah i missed last meeting lol im just looking through it now oh wait how did the thing w hannah go is everything good now?	Oh rightt She hasn't talked to me about that specific issue since Shes always friendly so idk what she's thinking sometimes
oh okay how are you feeling about it though i remember last time you were questioning like your role/actions as director	yeah i mean
LOL her and jack had some jabs today	u mean in meeting rn
or maybe i was just trying to find drama LOL	or like outside of it
meeting	lol i think they're ok usually when they go off it's worse
oh okok hahahh	yeah anyways i ended up ranting to my parents about it too my dad was completely useless my mom was like regarding when they argue i should like not try to not have an opinion even if it's like potentially abrasive
omg sorry i was eating dinner between meetings hm do you have one though	"sometimes my opinion is ""i don't think it's a big deal"" but i should just express that ig"
HAHA mood lol wait sorry i left the mtg but was allen in a breakout room or did he leave the call	hi sorry
hi issokay jamieboo	haha did i figure it out
yah hhaha	yayyy
hey jamie we're trying to find emails of potential speakers and we cant find the email of liu qing / jean liu (ceo of didi) but she went to harvard would you mind asking one of your simons friends to check the alumni database for her email LOL	oh lol yeah sure i thought jack was cross reg'd doesn't he get a harvard email
yeah he tried and it didnt work lolol	:o why
we should take a harvard class sometime	that's elitist we should
idk maybe they know hes a scammer	i want to
me too	damn how'd they know
lesdoit	ok let's find a good hass class
ok yay not next sem though im taking 14.73	if it's online it'll be really easy to go there tho what's 14.73
for cih / concentration credit	:oo are u concentrating econ did u take 14.01
world poverty or something? idrk and yea and no LOL i shouldve taken it this sem o well	oh why'd u choose like 14.73 instead of like 14.32 or something else
but i want to take the class at harvard	lol fair
14.32 doesnt count for concentration credit right 	i'm not sure lol
but youre the second person who has suggested that to me so idk anymore it says The following subjects are not acceptable:   14.30 and 14.32	uh i got it from jianna plus i wanted to take it earlier but there was a preq
oh is jianna doing a 14 concentration	14.01/14.02 is a req why aren't u doing that first lol uh idk she just heard it was interesting i want to take 14.13
for what	econ & psychology for the concentration lol it's like the base class for the concentration
oh bc i need a cih by end of next term *year and 14.73 is only offered in the fall	oh u haven't taken a ci-h yet?
you need 2 by soph year is 900 a cih	By the end of sophomore year?
yeah	U just need one a year Wait I'm not sure you're like understanding my question tho
? lol i took 24.00 which was a cih	Like I'm asking why take 14.73 and like why do u have to take your ci-h in the fall You could also take another random ci-h in the spring And take a different econ class
oh i looked through the cihs and didnt really find any of them interesting lol so i figured if i had to take one id do it in 14 to knock out a credit for my concentration	Oh I see lol
also i heard 14.73 is pretty good and bens taking it w me	I was about to ask u that next lol Alright li T
but i know i should be taking a class that i actually find interesting sigh	I mean it could be a good class
not super interested in it based on its description what are you thinking of taking	Like hass or in general
hass but ig general too?	14.01 pribably I don't have an econ background So I'll see if I can make it through that first And see if I'm interested
oh noooo wait i wanna take 1401 w you take 1473 w us lol and then 1401 w me in the spring	Haha jianna might take it too
pleeeeease	That's so backwards tho why haha
:( its not a prereq or anything	Lol I'm not as Advanced as u
wat how is this advanced	Let's start nice and easy
1473 is easy LOL 1401 is hard	Bro how do u know
from what ive heard 1473 is like ezpz	I wanna take a ci-h in a random field
everyone hates 1401 ah ok	Lol true Thats why if u get through it U know you're suited for econ
oh i think im doing econ either way are you deciding between econ and 9	There's no 9 concentration
oh nvm	Im deciding between a lot of things I took the wrong hass both semesters Neither of them were suited for exploration
ME TOO oh acting was just stupid and 2400 was ok	Ugh are all hasses just bad
i feel like kinda? i do want to take a hass at harvard	Do Harvard classes count as CI-Hs
idk im sure if you pick the right one and petition not sure how it works tbh	Lol same
also i forgot we have to take one hass per sem dang it i gotta redo my courseraod	U don't have to I think I think just like by the time u graduate
isnt it 8 total oh well yah	Yeah
i dont want to take more than one ever HAHAH	LOL low-key same
:'( well you should consider 14.73 :)	Will do I haven't courseroaded yet
ah ok and then take 14.01 w me in the spirng we can suffer together	LOL probably not but i'll think about it
:( ok	<33
jamie am i in the wrong call for blm	yeah it's starting now we went over
sorry i’m driving and it cut out but i’ll check the meeting notes later	ok sure

I'm kidding dont get mad	Omfg I'm not an angry person I'm very
Okay now I'm a bit confused You went from	OK yes

you cant guilt trip me like this jamieee	Well Am I right Or am I righ THE RELEVANT LOCATIIN IS HERE RIGT NOW OK I have to get my laundry Think carefully About the pain you're trying to put me throuh
aww i promise ill go up to maseeh next time O wait I have a good point Our room is secluded Idk if that's actually a good thing But it's a thibg	Yes that's true But
I was gonna say dont give me a but	But

I have an umbrella	Again How does that make the walk for me any better YOURE NOT EVEN GOING TO EAT DINNER W ME
Kevin will Is that good enough? You missed a call from dave. Stop ignoring me This makes me sad	Oh Sorry I was folding laundry Sorry Don't be sad But next food Isn't even Like Great U should eat at maseeh Regardless of whether it's w me or not
If we keep arguing we wont even get a chance to meet up	Today is suboptimal for meeting up when I have to put myself in a nervous state for 0001
I have 5.12	Okay but you're not type A
How do you know that I could be very good at hiding my nervousness	It's the vibes man I have to make myself really anxious before a test It's the only way I can force myself to study
Arent you done studying?	"One can never be ""done"" Studying"
If you have that mentality you will be miserable during the school year	Well i didn't say that But I do know That I will not have fun Taking an exam Therefore
It's fine just stay in your room	This is okay
I'll just be sad in my room and maybe I'll drop by on my way to dinner	Lol omg U only have to be sad For like Another 18 hours Can u tell
Okay go back to studying then	This is my favorite sticker pack I feel like I'm not doing much But I can't just Not study yanno I feel the overwhelming guilt of not studying If I don't try

Uhh Not my problem to figure it out The ppl organizing it hopefully know how to get there	there is also this one so u should probably figure out which one it is lol u want to drop by maseeh
I meet them at lobby 7	to say hi to me?
And we all go up there together Yes	LOL ok
And maybe annoy you a little For not walking to next	oh i was going to offer u a good luck for your 45 minute walk
Not anymore after I said that?	that would be correct
I dont need your luck	how about u walk by maseeh and look up to the 6th floor ac unit and yell really loud and i'll yell back from my room with the ac unit
Wtf you wont come down if I walk all the way to maseeh?	LOL i'll probably be downstairs for dinner
This friendship is severely one directional	I WALKED ALL THE WAY TO NEXT TO SEE YOUR CORNER TRIPLE I EVEN KNOW YOUR ROOM NUMBER what's my room number
6	and?
room Close right?	... you're right it is one directional
What time are getting dinner? Are you*	uhhhh hold on let me agree with anjalie on smth
Good luck	ok so like 530
So if I drop by around 630 you should be done right? Maybe Kevin will be willing to go up to maseeh to study	okay lol u don't need to make him come yeah i should be do u want to just hang out on our floor for a bit
Yeah sure	lol ok good luck
Cya later	again Also I just got my food they did the like Make it in front of u thing So Is 630 Like an exact thing

9	Oh that's earlier than I expected Thought u were also 11am
Nah we are earlier	is orgo easy for u
Not really But hopefully the test isnt too hard	i was gonna say 6.0001 isn t until 11am so you could potentially yeet it out
Uhh you mean take 6.0001 as well? I'm not smart enough for that	Yeah And I think u could
It's too late for that If I was gonna do that I should've gotten ready sooner	Meh

Uhh Maybee But we will play something else if you come	lol ok i'm with anjalie rn tho and she def doesn't want to move either way i haven't even started packing anyways
Aww ok	:p meh wow in this time you've been sending me stickers you could have walked to maseeh
But Frank and saaketh tho	yeah true all of our friends are in next big sad
Hmm now Kevin thinks I meet up with you everytime he leaves	Is he drunk
Yep	lol he's not like very upset is he
Uhh maybe a little	Oh man What about Wait until tmrw morning And just see how he feels Lmao I literally haven't been to next in two weeks
Yeah he will probably be over it then And yeah I've missed your presence you should come	Bro they just cancelled the techx retreat Big sad
Wtf	Wait R u drunk
So you didnt need to pack? Nah	It was supposed to be tmrw morning Yeah
I don't drink	I just got an email
Yet	Lmao alright well Don't go over board
Wait dw about me I'll be fine	I wasn't u seem
But yeah you should come to next sometime	Reasonably responsible Yeah I would have of not for retreat honestly Wait that's so sad I was excited to go to Maine and even dropped my spot on club tennis sectionals roster to go to this
Awww itll be okayy	Mehhh at least I'll have more time to work this weekend We should hangout too
Yeah that's true And yeahh	When did next become central location for hanging out It's not Central at all
Its because we are cool	If u have to say that you're cool Chances are … Well Ill stop there
Aw why are you so mean	Also have I sent u this piece of gold sticker yet
Yeah you have	Look at this fucking Banana Why is itfunnyso f Oh that sent weird Dw was joke I think you're cool Truly Honestly
Why was retreat cancelled?	The bus broke down
O wtf	They spent two hours trying to find another way
Just get a course 2 to fix it	But they couldn't Lmao ikr Probably is even worse for the techx exec since they spent so much time effort and probably money planning it
Yeah that must suck	What time r u waking up tmrw morning
Probably pretty late Around 12 ish? I need some sleep Its been a long week	Oh I forgot to ask Howd 004 go
I did pretty bad But oh well	Your lab must take so much time
I'll study more next time	Yeah that's alright
I got a 79 Hbu?	Oh wait that's passing that's ok 90
That's good	But I went to the three hour review session and did both practice exams
Yeah I'll definitely do that next time	Yeah it's pretty helpful for figuring out exam specific content But dwai too much
Oh well I'm also pretty dumb ig	79 isn't bad by any means and it's still passing Which is all u need
Eh yeah	Wow are u asking to fight me
No need	I cannot even begin to express the inaccuracy of this statement
Mehhh	No let's just fight so I can get it out of my system I will beat the fucking sadness out of u
Oh no I'm terrified	… Pick a time and place I can take u on any day
I wont argue	That's better Now just pretend I metaphorically beat the sadness out of u
Okay	Sleep is useful for that too So u should probably sleep
Yeah you right I'll get ready to sleep	:o did u just say get ready
Yeah	I've been laying in bed for the past half hour
Oh You should just go to sleep Gn	My whole circadian rhythm is off rn my active hours are between 12 and 3
Perfect	Omfg no this is very much less than perfeft have u started lab 6 yet
Nope	ok good let's do it this weekend wait david were u just on stud 4
Yeah	oh lol i thought i saw u going down the elevator but i wasn't sure  Not sure why it linked u jacks pic but it's a confessions post
Why is next 4w the most active on confessions We arent that bad	Idek I feel like it's so dead have u done the practice quiz b
Yeah Sorta I skipped one question	did you do the fsm please say u did i'm so confused
Yeah	what does part b mean what is value of N
how many wires necessary	but how do u know
there are 6 possible states so 3 wires will be enough	wait what u went from like a to b with no in between
three wires can have 8 permutations	wait wtf the wires are supposed to represent states ?
yeah	... ok thanks dave much appreciated
yeah np good luck studying im so tired i gave up its so cold	aren't u indoors wait i'm actually incompetent though
yeah but earlier	idk anything
i skipped all the coding ones	omg
so im gonna be hella screwed for those	i was just about to ask u about that one
idk if i work up enough energy ill try it	okay stay warm drink hot water and then do this test please and thanks :))
im gonna go take a 30 minute warm shower	ok sir good luck have fun did u do it
No I'm about to start tho	sir ok lmk
ok i stumbled thru the coding one	dude i never would have gotten the function for addcSUm
yeah same oh well	how the fuk were we supposed to know that we needed to implement a new function i'm so done with this
its okay	oh whale
you probably need like a 90 on this and you'll already have an A	90 is a bit high don't u think
i mean with another test and final proj to go i feel like that should be reassuring	uhhhh yeah i mean i need an 80 on both exams to get an A without doing the design project is that in groups btw
i dont think so was it previously?	anyways i don't feel confident about this no clue what are u taking next semester btw
6.006 6.036 8.022 some hass	8.022 omfg wait u and i are taking like
and 6.08	basically the same classes we've talked about this oops
yeahh	14.01????
how do you feel about 042	should i stick with it
maybe	uhhh i kind of gave up on studying for 042 wait if you're also taking 6.08
i already know im gonna make the mistakes they told us not to make	then you'll add a 5th oop i think i will too i always get docked on the dumb shit like not writing up smth correctly or not elaborating carefully i did the practice problems last night
i feel like i need to show up to all the lectures the ones i skip i can tell i have noticeable lack of knowledge even though i told myself i would learn it myself later	it was quick but i couldn't figure out the combinatorial proof why did u skip it's like right after 042 004*
i only ditched once intentionally the other times i had stuff going on	that's unfortunate it's not like u learn a lot from lecture though just like minimally
yeah true i actually like combinatorial proofs a lot	but ig it makes a difference i mean i like them when i know them but if i don't know how to get the same set i just feel dumb
yeah im gonna eat my words tmrw during the test	lmao no commit to it half of it is like confidence not really but like at least 22% of it
looks like ill get at least 22% then does that sound like confidence	do u want me to say yes
no i dont need you to im that confident xd	"""people who use xd don't deserve rights"""
:( who said that	confessions and a lot of things
aw fuck	btw the 4w thing was about baker and i was like wtf
o	i just realized today
looks like we arent as bad as you think	no it's still bad simply geographically wait no it's quiet tho i like it except now i can't really visit so
yeah its too col cold	well yeah that
maybe one day i just wont go to class	and the fact that kevin probably doesn't want to see me there good move
hm he's not really mad at you	i got up at like 917 for my 930 today why does he ignore me then
its just his way of responding to stuff like this	i feel like he'd be happier not talking to me cuz the last time i tried to talk to him it was like not positive response so i was like aight i guess he doesn't want to
i guess you figured out why he doesnt talk to you now anymore	because he think he'd be happier? oh :(( that's a bit sad but if that's what he wants i mean like in terms of general happiness though is he fine
yeah i think so	alright that's good
yeah i wouldnt worry about this	:ppp ok
its not really anything you did anyways	i mean r u sure lol
yeah i mean what did you do wrong	idek that's why i'm asking ig
yeah exactly theres nothing	hm
you didnt do anything wrong its just that things don't work out i guess	okayyyy imma be so happy when 004 and 042 are over tho
yeah same kinda	like this two exams have been lowkey making me not a happy camper
o why not?	i think i can only relax for like a day after tho
its not like the stakes are that high	i'm just a very type A person and i feel like just bad not knowing material for an exam
oh okay yeah i get it	even if it doesn't matter realistically speaking
idk you might want to work on that eventually	like i don't like feeling unprepared
idk if reaching for an a all the time will be the best thing for your mental state	wait i'm like fine as long as i did my best but like obviously
thats not really any better yeah	i have been sleeping in 004 well ig
because no matter what i think you always think you could do more	yeah that's true omg how do i get rid of it i mean i'll just
idk just fail really hard once	get over it after the fact oh
sorta got me to get over it	that's kind of what my dad said but i'm like not actively seeking failure u know
yeah but sometimes its not something you can avoid	i guess so we'll get to that when the time comes i'm not like doing terribly rn
hm yeah	i just am like meh mehhh
mehhh	you know what i mean the mehhhhh
yeah	ok good cuz i wasn't going to be able to put it in words lol
you'll be fine no matter what if you were ever worried about careers and the future and whatever	i think i was before now it's like i think i'll turn out fine but i still have this expectation like things i think i could be doing and want to do it's like whatever tho it's not really a big deal do u listen to music dave
i do what sort of question was that you act like im not a human	wait some people actually don't listen to that much stuff what sort of stuff do u listen to like as in they aren't on spotify a lot or actively getting new music well...
What's that supposed to mean Oh that's me Mostly just some kpop and pop music	wait yay that sounds familiar i wanted to send u a song rec of the song i was currently listening to and then u ghosted me for an hour so it passed well
I was doing the first practice test sorryy I put everything on airplane mode when I work	lmao no it's fine that's pretty smart i would probably do that too but how was the first one
It was okay	there's a mistake on the answer key for the minispec imp one
I fucked up the processor one again	for the opLW: the ALUFunc should be ? well yeah that one's hard so like i feel like whatever about it
Do you have a crib sheet	for 6.042? uhhh yeah but i didn't really write any of the hard stuff on it
Mehh I guess I need to look over some of the stuff I missed	my TA said some of the hard stuff like birthday paradox was fair game and i was like aight i'll just take the L
Oh no I missed that lecture	oh well it's fine i didn't learn anything from it anyways
Well fuck I'll take a look rn anyways and hope for the best	uhhh i don't really know much beyond the general concept it's just like you are exponentially more likely to have the same birthday as somebody else in a room with every person you ad not u in particular but two people in the room and the expected number of people u need to find a duplicate is only around 23
Oh I see okay Guess I'm reading the textbook	wait it's a good idea to just read the chapters that we were assigned just to know what you should know and kind of categorize the stuf
Yeah I'm doing that now	004 results out
Yeah ik I'm pretty tilted I missed 8 points on the pipe lining question	O Wait how do u remember the question number
4 It's because its 16 points 8 per question	:o Sorry Please explain to ne Why we are doing gcd For half an hour
Idk All that I do know is that I should've not shown up today	smh i feel cheated out of my mit education
Its okayy More time to work on 009	big sad either way
Hello how are you doing	Lol hi Dave I'm doing OK how about u
I'm doing ok	Wait u probably dont know I'm home rn by Yeah
I'm pretty tired tho	I'm home rn Oh Wait why
I slept too late last night And I was a good student And went to class	Partying it up I presume Lmao is there even class today
Yesh	I thought there wasn't
Yeah I had 5.04	Oh huh
How is home?	Warmer than I expected I'm just
Aww you just made me sad	Straight chillin Oh
I want home to be warm	Sorry I mean I assume it is R your parents thee yet
Nope They get here tmrs Tmrw I'm happy to hear you are relaxing	Oh yaya excitinggg U should relax too
Yeah after todau	I'm half assed relaxig
I have like 4 more hours of lab to go	I have some MISTI apps to write before the end of this Oh  that's right you're like in lab so long every day Dude That sucks Majorly Damn My opinion is that u should just sleep After lab Well Est first Snd then sleep
Sounds like a good plan When are you coming back?	Early Saturday morning Plenty of time to come back and worry about 004 And 009
I feel like theres nothing to worry about for you But ok	Meh I don't know the material tho I feel like I should try to learn it at least
Good meme	????
I'm complimenting you	Oh Well Thank u very much Although I don't get it
I think that you are smart so you already understand it Maybe not to the level you want to But you get most of it I'm still at lab too This is so sad I cant get my procedure to work well	Wait whatttt Still???
I mean I sorta took a 1 hour break To go to 042 recitation	:(( big sad A better day is always coming Have I told u that before
I don't think so	My pistol I structure said Instructor Tells us that All the time
One day itll no longer be true But you'll never find out That sounds a lot sadder to me	Yeah Because it is Why R u so saf :((
I'm not I think	R u sure Have u done anything fun recently
Hmm Not really	Okay So
But also break is coming up	I feel like u should Yah guess so
Yeah I will be soon	Okay good A BETTER DAY IS COMIGN DAVE
I might have to go to lab this weekend	Wtfff Don't go Skip Don't go
If I dont go I wont progress	Can't u go some time later tho Like after the weekend You'll still progress then?
Yeah I guess	Sooooooooooooo Jus Save it for later
Hmm	Hmmmmmm Is right
What have you done More ppl call me dave now Even tho you've never met them I feel like it originated from you	Ayeeeeee Yesssss I'm proud Dave is an endearment!!!! Good things from me ONLY
okayy fine it might grow on me eventually	:DD Wait if u don't like it now I can call u david :p
nono its okay do you have fun thanksgiving dinner plans?	Uhhhhh I'm folding laundry for my mom RN But in the evening we have some family friends holding a small party It'll be good food My mom will probably just make me say hi to everybodh And then I'll just chill on my laptop for a bit
sounds like a good thanksgiving still tho does relaxing feel like a foreign concept now :P	Ehe I haven't done any work tho So I'm feeling pretty relaxrd Once I get back on campus tho U know my stress is just gonna back up lmao :pp big sad Did your parents come yet? What r your plans
my parents are not here yet but we are getting dinner with family friends i love this time of year where we can celebrate getting fat together	Yay good OK first of all You are not getting fat If anything We can only hope U will not be twiggy When I return
hey at least i havent been losing weight since coming here ik some ppl lost quite a bit of weight	I mean yes but That's not good U should have Healthy expectations
Fine you are right I was just in the gym	When sir am I not GAInSs?!?!?! 
If only Then I wouldn't be twig How often do you play tennis now	:(( it's okay life is like that sometimes
One day	Like not at all
I believe in myself	Ive missed all practice For the last 2 weeks
Just too busy?	But usually two or three Yeah And I'm home rn
Yeah I was just curious You are always so busy I would've been very impressed if you went to tennis	Don't let anybody tell u to change who u r sir
And I guess I still am at how you handle so many things	Aha I mean tennis is so relaxing and fun tho Even if I suck Sir I am handle nothing When are we going to play tennis Should just come to practice one day Ooh wait didn't we say we should go ice skating
yeah we shouldd but also we arent here over iap :( its too cold to play tennis now i just want to stay in a warm room	boooo why indoor courts - club tennis gets them for free i think? but we have courts during practice so u could just come during practice dude i realized i'm always cold at home lmao wait why is 6.08 lab so long omfg
im okay with how they scheduled stuff tho all the classes i wanted fit together so nicely	yeah i was surprised that none of my classes had any conflicts i mean it's essentially the same classes as you so it was redundant for me to say that did u happen to take notes in 042 lec this week
Not really rip	sad i have no idea what is going on btw how much of the pset have u done
none xd	Smh i can't do any of it
im starting to work on it now and it looks like cancer	well i've been working on this since like 2pm and i'm on 2b so let me know what u get for everything before that
i skipped one and i did 2	to be fair i skipped lecture so i know none of this do u want to explain 2b and 2c to me
2b is transitive property 2c is look for the pattern	wtf is transitive property
like if a = b and b=c then a = c idk if we actually learned that but you can use it i think	uhhhhhh ok like rem(sum of digits, 9) = rem(31^4159, 9) ?
yep and the sum of sum of the digits mod 9 equals that first bit	i got there but how do u know what the sum of sum ... is
we dont need to know that we just know that from that the sum of the sum of digits mod 9 equals 3 to that big number mod 9 which is what you are trying to show	wait how do u know it's 3 tho
sorry 31^4159 not 3	wait sorry i'm asking about c now where it asks to actually find the remainder
oh for c you look for a pattern try the first few numbers	oh wait aren't we supposed to use modulo arithmetic tho
and when finding the next remainder you only have to consider the previous remainder yeah that trick comes from modular arithmatic	the fuck ok wait let me just try it
ok	also for a i got that the sum of B was at most 11 not 12
how did you get 11?	i said that 31^whatever < 10^4160 then i just did 9*4159 and summed those digits
shouldnt it be 10^8318?	oh fuckkkk
and also it wouldnt be to 4160 anyways since the biggest sum would come from all 9's not one 1 and the rest are 0's o wait i also fucked it up a bit	like i did 10^4160 and then said that like
should be 8319	the max could be 99999 but like 4159 times then summed that to get A
yeah thats tright	but like not 4159 times
so what number did you upper bound the sum of digits to be? what a could be at most	37431 4159*9 then i said that the sum of A is max when 29999 which sums to 38 for B then 11 for sum of B
yeah so you were just missing the factor of 2 in the beginning if you added that then the rest is right	hmm ok thenk have u done 3a
I'm out getting dinner	boo okay enjoy lol :pp What the fucking fuck it was your birthday yesterday???? Shitttt Sorry I didn't wish u But HAPPY BELATED BIRTHDAY DAVID
aww thank you	:(( sorry I missed it
its all good :P	mehhh what'd u do to celebrate
ate cake and went out to eat i have too much cake if you want some	wtf yes ofc i want cake but yayy did u have fun
yes it was fun	how do u count the number of cycles an interation of a loop takes
I think its just when the first instruction gets loaded again I need to study for 6.004 Do you want to study together	wait i thought so too but that's not true on quiz b u can see
O I only looked at quiz a so far	from looking at the answers i'm pretty sure once you confirm that you take the branch loop it's the number of cycles before that but i'm not sure when do u want to study
Tmrw at 11?	042 rec for me ngl i have like only 3 hours open tmrw and like post 10pm
Oof okay nvm then Its okay I'll just be sad alone then	i mean i was going to spend those 3 hours in 004 office hours anyways so that's like 12-1 and 3-5 if u want to join me
Cant I gotta study for 5 04 then	lmaooo
I also need to sleep rn	nice okay good night
Goodnigjt hello i have a question about 004	yeah what's up
i figured it out nvm no thanks to you :P jkjk	:ooo sorry Are u in lab right now
No I'm near campus tho	Oh I just walked by And thought u might be spending your Friday night there And felt sad

Okay cool I guess I can try to think of something we can do tmrw Does 009 have a final?	No I took my last quiz last wed
Oh yayyy Sounds like you will have a pretty carefree finals week I think I'm gonna go back to sleep I slept at 6 today	Omfg Why I just have one yeah So I'm chillin R h going to logs tmrw
No dont think so	Booo It'll be fun

When and where?	Kresge Starts at 8pm but I'm going a bit late
Do you need tickets?	Nope it's free
Ok I'll consider it Idk tho I might be hanging out with some other ppl tn But I'll try to go	Meh Ok
How's break treating you?	Heyo It's been kind of busy so far honestly I was home running errands for three daus
What the heck	Then I went to vegas Not like work work Busy Just like a lot of things to do
Gambing?	Lmao No skr My mom blew like 20 on slot machines tho
I'd say that is relatively tame	I just got home last night Yeah just for the kicks
But yeah I feel you I've sorta been busy too	I woke up at like 2 todau I just want to sit down and do nothing yanno
In the same sense that I've just been doing stuff	But I feel like the time is passing too quick Low-key kind of scared to go back on campus lmal And feel
That's my plan tmrw	The work ahain I have an eye doctor appt tmrw :pp Might try to watch jumanji
If it makes you feel better I probably have the shortest break I'm flying back on the 3rd since flight times didnt work out well for me	That Is incredibly sad You're like On campus on campus during iap right
No I'm in rhode island xd	Oh the fuck that's rigjt
Yeahh	Man
I wont see you for a monthh	That's just sad man Omfg Imma be So Lonelh
Yeah my life seems to be defined by sadness	:oo Dave sir Are u okay
Yes of course	Hmm Ok This one is better actually Wait Do u know anybody else in Rhode island For iap
I know ppl at brown But not from mit	Oh rightttt brown is there
Idk maybe I'll hang out with them a few times	Bro u sound even lonelier than me already
It's fine I need some alone time I realized I didnt get any alone time basically all of first term	Oh huh Well u live in a triple so I guess it's unavoidable Idk tho I like alone time too But then I felt like Once I got on campus Even tho I was like Usually around people I got almost too much alone time Like Idk
I guess you are an extrovert at heart	Ugh this is a problem tho Cuz like I wanna be around people But then I just Have no willpower to make it happen Idk
?	Like It's just easier for me To stay inside maseeh all the time
Ah I see	Or only do routine things I'm lazy too So That would Contribute pro ably
I mean you are already in a quad That's quite a bit of social interaction	I mean yeah I like my quad and the quad across the hall a lot So it is A good amount
Yeah exactly	But then I feel like I should be not just Idk how to explain it Like Sitting still When I still could be meeting new people or spending time with friends outside of maseeh Which does mean you btw Among others
Eh I think you'll be fine I mean yeah I know what you mean But if it got to the point where it was unbearable you would go out and talk to ppl	Hmm yeah I feel like it's partially like A lifestyle habit I want to chanhe Because I feel like I've been doing more hermitting than I want to So I told myself I would try not to do that next semester lmak OH I FORGOT TO TELL U When I went home over Thanksgiving break i was talking to my friend who's a senior in hs And he considered doing chem Olympiad seriously for a while And I was like talking about some friends or smth but your name came up and I was like oh yeah did Chemoly stiff And then he was like Wu? And I was like yeah? How did u know? And he was like Yeah isn't he from California and I was like yeah? And then he was like oh Ive seen his name a couple of times before on chem oly stuff (I'm assuming he meant rankings) before And I was like holy shit I literally met a celebrity and didn't know it Lmao
Noooo I'm not Your friend just saw me on the top 20 list I'm frankly pretty bad at chem compared to a lot of the other ppl who did it seriously	A CELEBRITY I TELL U Sir This kind of negative self talk Will not be tolerated Pistol instructor told us that negative self talk isn't good for the brain
Hm probably true No wonder I have 2 neurons	"Lmao have u seen those ""me and my 2 brain cells at 3am"" memes Jokes dude"
Yeahh	OK I am going to sleep now
Okay gngn	But let's talk more tmrw or smth And we have to hang out more in the new semester
Okay okay sounds good	hi dave how is rhode island
It's pretty nice so far how are you liking being back on campus?	Do u start tmrw
it got moved back to wed	R u living with a roommate Oh huh
no i have my own airbnb	Not very much P empty
really?	Oh I see
i thought campus would have a decent number of ppl or are ppl getting back alter? later*	I mean it's a decent amount but not that much
your roommates are there?	Anyways I got used to the comforts of home Nope just me
oh no	Big sad
but i mean this could be your chance	This big ass quad all to myself
to talk to new ppl	Yeah I guess so
look at it as a good thing	Although I'm not sure when I would really see them Lol I'll try
im all alone in rhode island and im looking it at as good thing	You're right I should pull it together lmao
Nooo if you are going through something you should talk to someone about it	Lol we'll see how today goes I should be aight
how was your first day	it was not bad took a long time to get set up but i think the next few days are learning
yay thats good	What have u been doing these past few days
uhh so apparently i did start on monday so i guess ive been doing stuff	Oh huh How was it R u the only extern
yeah and it was fine the guy im reporting to is nice	Is it research work
no industry	Oh wait So is it like coding BTW did silvina send u an email about LAing for 004
it is coding and no because im bad i guess	Oh Sorry Whats your project
im making a web app using data from their databases to organize orders that clients make	Oh that's cool What language
idk mysql probably and then html css javascript for the front end they recently moved their database into some new system o nvm its sql server didnt realize that was an actual language hbu?	Powershell Is sql server the language
its the database structure they moved into	Oh it's a database relational management system Apparently
yeah	So r u writing SQL Too
yeah	Oh wow Thats Full stack sir Busy
i feel like the sql part is not too bad i feel like i can copy a lot of the existing code since some previous person did a lot of it but just ended up putting the data in an excel sheet instead of a web app	Oh I see Lol I see
yepp but also i have never touched html or sql prior to this so its gonna be fun what do you do around campu when you are not doing externship things?	it'll be a learning experience lol i am literlaly only doing externship things lol i got up at 8am today and didn't get back until 7pm basically
oh no i hope you find some time to relax you really should i was going to try to visit campus	Well I hung out with tai today for a little bit U should
its a 70 min commute	I mean I wasn't really at work until 840 and I left at 630
and i dont have a car so im gonna have to go to the train station	Oh man Is the train nice Idk how transportation works here
no idea i havent been on it yet i flew straight here well not straight technically but you know	Yes I get what you're saying lol
Yes Glad I dont need to elaborate	Do u live near any downtown areas
I'm 20 mins from providence I guess that's downtown	By walk or car
Car	Wait r u living in an apartment Oh also I'm going to bed now! Trying to fix my sleep schedule We'll see Good night
Goodnightt And no Airbnb	So is that like a house then Cuz airbnbs can be anything rigjt
its like a small single room thing its attached to my host's house	Oh wait that's really interesting I've never heard of anything like that
yeah i guess ive never had something like this before either	So like could your host just like Enter your room
i mean theres only one door and its kept locked at all times and also i just stacked my suitcases there xd :P	Just in case How long is your commute every day Is there like public transport
its prob not convenient since its basically rural here i just uber its like 7-8 mins	Oh dang Isn't that a bit scary Is the uber cheap
eh i think its okay i already got used to it basically and lyft is running promotion rn so it works out well with the $2 off its like 5 dollars	oh nice i could never bro living in rural areas is like creepy
yeah i do agree there is a weird vibe but itll be okay im imagining this as my go into the woods and come back a better person sort of thing well at least i hope i become a better person	Oh huh I guess What's wrong with you now
Jeez you sound so fed up Idk I feel like I can be a better person	No Im not I mean it legitimatwlh Like There's nothing wrong w u now
Ehh I have bad habits	Ok Whatever u say I'll believe u But Don't worry too much lol

sounds funn	it was pretty nice to leave the dorm honestly the weather was really good
yeah it was even here thats why i went for a run	yeah my dorm is kind of dead though ohhhh yeah makes sense
yepp imi gonna come back having lost a ton of weight cooking for myself is hard	oh no that's not good i can imagine yeah i don't know how to cook i could never live by myself now that i think of it lol
at this point i eat one legitimate meal a day and the other times i just eat a bar or fruit or something	Bro u need to take care of youraelf Health first Don't wreck yourself yet Its only freshman year
cooking is hard	i agree r u still doing okay like healthwise
yeahh* how about you do i really give off those im doing really badly vibes?	well i've given up on the find food myself thing and just meal planned it
oh i see	"u give off those ""i think i'm doing ok but in reality this month is probably gonna wreck me"""
im going to try and make some fettucine alfredo	what that's so boujee
ohh i se thats a fair assessment but really ill be okay	"""i'll be okay"" sounds like ""i'll survive"" and that is a LOW BAR take care of yourself u fool health first"
ill try my best But look at this I decided to throw sausages into it for protein	oh wait wow that actually looks really good where's the green stuff tho
The parsley? I didnt have any ripp	damn u know what parsley is tho so that's a plus eh that's okay maybe like buy some fruits or smth from the grocery store if u can
Yeah I should	hi dave how r u
im good how about you im on campus rn	what the fuck why am i only hearing about this now
back for the weekend :P	ayeeeee
my roommates found out today too	damn this is crazy omg let's do smth fun over the weekend
what do you have in mind?	dunno i have low bar for fun these days want to go to hmart w me
oh no	i need fruit
hmm sure	lol so is this like a surprise to everybody that exists rn u coming back i mean
uhh not entirely i was back last weekend	oh what
but that was because franks birthday	i see how it is
wait no literally just cause his birthday	what'd u guys do for his birthday smh smh fine
sorryyy :P but yeah what time tomorrow?	i'm gone next weekend actually cuz i'm going home probably early afternoon?
okay sure just lmk when	i'm thinking like 2 3pm
yeah sounds good	okkkkk
i gotta go call my parenst see you tmrw since cny after all	yeah lol i called my grandparents tonight k byeeeeee uhhh i think i'll be done with my laundry around 330 do u wanna go then
ok Ok Are you almost ready? I can start heading up to maseeh	My laundry comes out at 330 I came to dewey To check out a book Eo m not back yet
Ok I'll just be at maseeh around 330 then?	Sounds good
I'm here	I'll stop in the lobby on my way up from ground Fencing Tue Thur 1pm Let's do Kt
i gotta check my schedule i think im really busy tue thur	noooo sad
yeah ik mehh i wanted to do fencing too but yeah i dont think i have time tue thur	r u going to do a different section then
not sure yet i gotta take a look at whats offered still and what times work	hmm ok well it opens tomorrow morning
yeah ik uhh ill probably figure that out soon	lol okk well lmk!
imma finish watching youtube ok!	we probably won't be in the same section but if you're also in fencing at least we can complain about it together i just watched a pivotal episode of my kdrama it is taking all of my willpower to not watch another and just go to sleep rn i'll tell u more about it tmrw but it's actually crazy and i'm actually in so much confusion right now
i just got a lot of chaotic energy from those last few messages i can tell you are in much confusion	Yes CHAOTIC omg I'm feeling so many mixed feelings
itll be ok just go to sleep :P	OK :(((
i just ended up not signing up for pe nothing interesting enough in the time slots i had did you watch the next episode of your kdrama?	:(( ok fine i watched one more before class at like 630pm there's one more episode left i think i'll save it for tmrw it's gotten even more existential crisisey so i'm just out here not having a good time
Noo stop this Dont get all sad on me Send me your schedule I can see what classes we will be in together Since some of the classes have multiple lecture times	it's not even a typical kdrama at this point i was looking for something funny and instead got sucked into this sad societal commentary-like piece about how hard life is for people send yours ideally it'd look like this gonna try and get that 8.02 lec slot tmrw morning everything else is mostly set in stone we'll see if i get into 11.011
oh i see okay wait can you request lecture times? oof oh noo my gf was like you should watch you on netflix but i watched one episdoe and its pretty dark and depressing so i am choosing not to watch it anymore	I also heard that it was really good but Also dark For 8.02 u can switch yeah Sad my 6.08 lab only fits in the evening
Oh I see ripp	yee
How was your day?	my day is still on going i'm at work rn
I know So am i	but my team is kind of on fire rn because of some problem w google
Does that include you?	so i'm sitting quietly at my desk and i'm gonna stop bothering them no all my work is separate
I guess that's good Hm also I think we need to talk about something But it can wait until I get back onto campus	sounds ominous but ok yeah i mean but now i'm just wasting my time at work bc nobody will approve my PRs
Rip What are you doing then?	texting u lmao no jk i was finishing up reading a C# tutorial
Oh I see How's that wasting time?	well i'm sort of tired so i don't feel like i'm learning a lot from it i'm just reading but i think i'm familiar enough w it to indicate proficiency on my resume lmao anyways i'm actually going to leave soon first 5pm in a while
Same	how'd your presentation go
I gotta go buy some thank you cards It went pretty well	everything worked?
Yep I had it all memorized too	u met the mit dude for the first time right
Yeah he's really nice and cool	dopeee
Well anyways go enjoy the rest of your evening I'm going to attempt fettuccine alfredo again This time hopefully not making a huge mess for me to clean up	Make sure u put the pan in the water afterwards I'll try lol Wat lab section
12 to 230	Boo Know anybody in 730
Yeah quite a few Ophelia and kevin And I think some others Seems like most ppl are in that one	Oh what Should I be avoiding Kevin lol Because I just talked to Ophelia earlier about being in the same lab
Yeah I think it's best if you do	Uhh alright what if Ophelia is also sitting there tho Cuz it's possible that I'll then have to be avoiding everybodh
yeah ik this was sorta what i wanted to talk to you about idk he was pretty mad at me i think becuase he thinks part of the reason why you are in 6.08 is because i talked to you about classes so thats sorta unfortunate	Lmao what OK well Idk what to do about this I won't even get to see u in 08 anyways lol
yeah ik	:pp
yeah its sorta a bad situation i guess but also idk maybe there are enough ppl in 08	Whatever meh have u done the regular exercises for the w2 yet 6.08
All of them besides the last one The fancy text one or whatever	can u help me with the discrete time signals one
Yeah when do you have time?	5pm?
Yeah that works	tyty
Do you still need help with the discrete signals one	Yes but I have smth at 545 And I feel like you're far away atm Does anytime this evening work for u
Yeah I should have some time	OK thank u Hey are u close to campus in like Half an hour
Yeah I can be Where?	Anywhere is fine Do u want to come to maseeh
Hmm stud then?	Lol Sure Stud 5 ? Or ground
Yeah sure We can just decide when we get there I'll be there at 730	745? Oh Sure K I'm here lmk
I'll be there in a few mins	how did you embed your yt video with markdeep i'm copy pasting the url in but it's not going in it's just writing the link
dont they have an example? i straight up opened the template and right clicked it and clicked download which downloads it as an html and then you open it up with a text editor ![My working project]( maybe try this command and swap out the url	well when it downloads it as an html that's not markdown is it it gets download as html
no its an html from markdown since they created it using markdown	but everything is formatted as html like <p> </p> and shit but it's supposed to just be like this
no this is what it looked like	what the hell that's not what happened when i clicked download i am starting from scratch
i think you dont choose to download the whole thing? i remember doing something and got weird html stuff but theres a way to get just the markdown things	this is muy life rn like there's no just like download button
okay finee let me try to help you :P	Tysm What button do I clikc I'm waving page as Savings*
whats your email? o huh i think that worked can you try downloading it	Oh wow I hope this works Im walking rn But give me 5 what the fuckity fuck it worked ily thanks sir
yeah np	Did u have to narrate your video or smth Saw smth on the write-up that was like some videos don't show full functionality And also why did u say the write up would take 3 hours I think I did most 9f it in like 20 min Am I missing smth
I was just saying it might take longer to figure out the formatting thing But you probably got all of it	Oh Huh
did you copy all of your code into the thing at the end i thought i remember seeing a piazza post saying we only need to put a few functions in there	Yes Oh I out everything xuz they said to I haven't done the highlighting specific portions yet
Do you need to highlight portions? I thought that was optional	Yeah I think it is Did u do it
i guess i am now i just moved some stuff from my other sections into the additional thoughts place and also when it says word limit is around 500 that doesnt include all the template stuff right?	oh ok yeah so i think i'm already there for the etch and sketch design exercise what sort of specifications do they want exactly for the GET request because if you can only use 2 buttons i imagine that one is used for posting and other is clear screen and they don't specify how we're supposed to have the ID for the GET request
Idk yet I havent looked at it Also for the partner evaluation were you able to do it? Mine said no recorded partners	i've only done one so far has there been another assigned oh are u doing the other design exercise first
Not sure yet	oh lol have u started yet
Nope	the second one is a partner one if u end up doing it do u wanna do it w me ok well lmk when u get to looking around at it
Oh but you got one partner for that?	yeah from like lab 01b or smth
Oh huh	i haven't done anything from week 2 yet my partner didn't show for lab01a
Was it in exercise 1?	uhhh i don't think so
I straight up didnt see any partner evaluation thing Can you show me where you found that?	it's gone now actually i can't find it anymore
Oh okay I dont think my partner showed up for that one Maybe that's why I didnt get a partner evaluation thing	i just remember it being on the assignments page oh i found it dave it's at the bottom of the regular exercises 02
yeah ik but mine says no recorded partners last i checked	oh huh
yeah idk maybe ill just post on piazza asking them	
yeah i saw that too xd ty tho	Smh
Have you done the 608 server assignment	i started it but i'm not done yet want to work on it on friday afternoon or smth u haven't done the other exercise yet right
Do you know why I'm getting this error This is the one where they teach you cygwin I can see the file on the server But I get this error	wait what which one is this what the hell is a server assignment
The week 3 assignemnt Not design exercise	what the fucking fuck i haven't started that
They just released it yesterday	oh whew but it's due on sunday night wow they played us sad
Yeah rip	help me dave have u done the design exercises yet tho
Nope lol I'll start them today	Omg dave Ok can u explain these two to me i don't understand what it's asking
Uhh do you still need it?	yeah i just skipped that exercise i just don't understand what it's asking
calculate how many bins there are	what are bins tho
its like volts per representation since you have 12 bits thats 2^12 bins	wait what
can you take a screenshot of the problem?	yes oh i see where it says 12 bits now this is confusing
ok so you can calculate the range of voltages that can be read by the esp	yeah by using voltage divider and plugging in the range of resistances right
yep and then you calculate the difference in those voltages	yeah
and divide that by the number of bins or actually	omfg the other way around yeah
number of bins divided by that yeah	wait what does this have to do with degrees then
since you know that there are 90 degrees right? so you can calculate volts/degree	yeah? oh wait
do you remember what you put for this what is R? i thought R would be like sqrt2 * .8	uh i forget let me check also i'm still not getting the right answer 32
do you remember how you got 32?	plugged into perceptron and tested it out
wait for the theoretical?	oh no sorry did R/gamma ^2
is R sqrt2 * .8? gamma is still .268	also i don't have the esp with me rn can u just tell me why joe's thing wasn't working
flipped x and y and flipped sign i think its the fourth one?	just found the largest mag and divided by gamma so it's like .8 or smth why sqrt 2 .8 + 1 maybe
+1?	there's like a theta_0 in there somewhere right yeah
oh right forgot about that	wait dave how do i integrate voltage into my calculation of bins per degree because if there are 4096 bins and 90 degrees isn't it just ~45 bins per degree
Yeah	but 45 isn't the answer
1/45m ?	wait wtf why
Degrees per bin?	no they want the resolution in bins per degree
Ohh uhh	and why do we need voltage for this calculation
I diff question? Or same one as before	same one as before
Like the picture you sent	yep i'm literally just big confused rn i got it
Sorry my phone died	All good
For the etch a sketch How long can your program record points	not very long i'm letting it record 2000 points but i can only pass in like 400 to the request
Yeah rio Rip	because each point has about 5 characters
Its like two lines of drawing xd	well i did make it so that it records only every 100 millis and that seems to make it a bit better
Hmm okay	but it's a little uglier wanna see my video
Did you make the gravity slower too? Yeah sure	?wdym gravity i'm only taking x and y accel
Like the ball moves slower	 yeah i only multiply the accel by a constant of like 300 or 400 can't remember
Hm I think technically your ball is a bit big but they probably wont care But yeah it looks good	that's the size it was on the last exercise lol so i just left it thanks lol i spend like 4 hours on it last night and finally finished the write up just now
Sounds like my night tonight	good luck it's a friday night tho maybe save it for tmrw
Yeah maybe	i haven't done the 036 exercises yet i'm going to do them later today but if i have like one more guess left on any of them can i ask u for help
Yeah sure	Thank yu have u done the blackjack design exercise
Nope I just ended up doing weather	Ok fair
Did you do both?	I tried to start the blackjack last night and realized there was way too much stuff
O shit ripp I saw they wanted us to make interface of cards plahed	So I was going to see if anybody could help me and if not give up
Played	Lol u don't have to u can just return the card codes Which should be enough to identify But It's annoying yeah
Yeah sorry I cant help I hope you find someone	Lol it's all good im hoping I'll get full points for the weather one And then there's only one more Trivia game for next week seems not bad Have u done 036 tho More important q
Yeah	Wait u have
The week 4 hw?	Yeah Like
Yeah	OK I'm going to try to do it today maybe will text u
I'm really bad at 036	Uhhh I think false
Frank helped me on some of the trickier parts	Shit that means it's hard
No I think it's not too bad I'm just sorta bad at python I forgot some of the things you can do Which made the last part way easier	Oh huh Ok Wait You're not bad at Python
Uhh that's false	Didn't you code like A decent amount in hs
Yeah in java xd	Bro Python is easier than java
Which I've also forgotten Yeah but I dont know the fancy tricks Like I'm not used to using lambda functions and shit	Lmao yeah neither am i
Ok that's not fancy But stil You get what I mean	Hmm Do i
Sigh I still gotta go do my write up for weather	It's p fast There's only Two requirements so Not a lot of stuff to write
Yeah true	do i need some epsilon value for the derivatives because d_nll_loss_th and th0 have items in the denom right g to be specific which could be 0 right
uhh i dont think you need episilon values are you using the formulas we derived?	yeah which has g in the denom
um maybe check answer for those you might have not simplified them all the way the fully simplified form doesnt have any denominator values i think	oh fuck i'm stupid let me try ok i got -(y*g)*x for the th deriv but it's not passing the test case for that one
did you figure it out?	No I went to tennis
Hm okay I dont really remember that one But idk if you want to pset together sometime tmrw I'm down I gotta do a lot of work	Yes that would b great Are u feel at 5pm Or after 1030pm
Wtf what is your schedule Uhh hmm I guess I have time after 1030	Lol sorry Today wasn't supposed to be busy but thrn It just Went to shit Ty Dave JOIN HACK DAVE
I dont have time tho :(	Nooo make time What r u busy with this semester I promise you'll be able to make it work
Mehh idk I feel like I wont be able to make it work Also dont really want to fill out applications rn Since those take quite a bit of work too	Aww I don't think it'll be that baf bad But Ok I accept your rejection
Sorryy but I really do think I have no time	Lol no it's totally ok do you understand the power exercise because i am completely lost
I've done a few of them Still gotta do the ui assignment tho	i skipped the game time and both wikipedias lmao i have literally done nothing thus far am i supposed to calculate like
The power one is pretty tricky	average current for each one
You should calculate the energy consumed per component per cycle	oh wha
At least that's the way I did it	what does that have to do with milliamphours then
Milliamp hour is a unit of energy	oh ummmmm ok i'll try wait you have some time for the current tho that something is running at a certain current but power needs some resitance or voltage right oh i see wait i'm getting some huge number when i calculate energy just for the sensoor tho like p = i * v right so energy = i * V * t
Yeah Ivt sounds right	right but the milliamp hours is only 540 and i'm getting some value way above that
Uhh are you converting seconds to hours and stuff	oh ok wait just to confirm i have to add the energies for all the components right sensor and mc and cm right and total energy is like 3.3 * 540 * 3600 or whatever right
Yeah That is the right approach	thank you for all of your help dave
Cant tell if that's sarcasm	wait no it's not sarcasm i'm actually very grateful
hm okay sorry i was a bit preoccupied hopefully ill be done with my stuff tn so if you have any other questions i should be more free later	ok tysm ok i still am getting just liek ridiculous numbers i'm going to do the design exercise for trivia rn instead lol and ask you when you have more time later
ok yeah sounds good	:DD DAVE is there a better way to use beautiful soop than get_text() get_text returns some sentences together that aren't separated by period space and only separated by period but this is a problem because some things like U.S. shouldn't be splitted
no i think beautiful soup is the best way to go and i think it only fails on the last one?	yeah so like how do i make it work all the time because i'm at 88.9% like best case
uh just do a replace() you need to remove newlines somehow anyways right?	ohhhh wait so does this mean i stay using get_text() or something else
stay using get text	whattttttt
but like after you use get text you still need to do a bit of processing right? since it gives you a bunch of newlines in the beginning	right but there's some spots when it's not a new line but there's like a period not followed by a space
oh hmm i feel like i didnt get that issue i did have one test case that had a newline in the middle and i dealt with that with a remove	"The cat (Felis catus) is a small carnivorous mammal. It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and often
referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from wild members of the family. The cat is either a house cat, a farm
cat or a feral cat; latter ranges freely and avoids human contact.
Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and for their ability to hunt rodents. About 60 cat breeds are
recognized by various cat registries.The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species, has a strong flexible
body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey. like this is what i get About 60 cat breeds are
recognized by various cat registries.The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species, has a strong flexible like this part has this random fucking period and no space"
how did you get rid of newlines before? like the ones in the beginning	i didn't remove any new lines until get_text
"wtf when i did get text i had newlines in the beginning so i manually removed those with remove and i gave myself a space for the newline in the middle by replacing it with a "". "" so i inserted a space after the period idk why it gives you different content thats pretty strange"	"wait are you also getting the result from the query the exact same way like extract, 'html.parser"""
i think i fed data directly into html parsers i didnt do what you did with the pages after i got the json data	you can't feed data directly into the beautifulsoup thing tho it throws an error
data = data['query']['pages'][key[0]]['extract'] i did that and extracted from there	wait literally exactly what i did
oh yeah hm yeah idk wtf html parser does apparently then	wait did you not use htmlparses
i did	or yours parsed differently? but the code defines that
soup = BeautifulSoup(data, 'html.parser')	which means i must be doing something weird? wow this is sad
did you figure it out?	no i'm so confused lmao this is incredibly sa maybe you can take a look tomorrow if you have time? if not that's ok i can try to ask somebody else too lol you've already been super helpful
yeah i gotta get work done tmrw too	dave have u finished 036 also i figured out power
yayy thats good and yeah i did finish	ok wait i just found one of my mistakes ikr belss ok i just found one of my mistakes so i'll let you know if i still have quesitons in like 2 minutes
oke	i did it thank you
I didnt do anything	lol thanks for the moral support i'm going to need help on the exercises tomorrow tho
What exercises	036? tuesday morning
Oh I think you'll definitely be fine	it's not easy
Well then I'm fucked too	lmao doubtful when are you leaving let's plan smth before u leave
im not sure yet imma wait until they tell us more in the official thing at 1	ok well don't let yourself leave without seeing me like you did over iap
wtf i wontt	smh dave you have a history of it
i wont this time :P	:pp Did u do lab 06a yet
Not all of it	OK I have Some questions
i may or may not be able to asnwer some of these but ill try i also have a question	Ok great What's your question
let me find the question	OK lol
oh yeah for scaled reading of lcd	Wwit The second one?
yep	That's my question
aw man fuckk	Aw man
what have you tried?	Map( But it doesn't register the variable name
oh wait i thought it was just straight up a number ok im definitlely doing osething wrong	It's a line of code right
yeah i sorta realized now	Fuvkk
ok i figured it out it just wants you to use the variables they specified to calculate for the value im gonna go out to get food soon did you  want to ask anything else?	wait is it map what's the variable specified idk why but i cant download the writeup file properly can u send when u have timw
It's not map I can try	Thank you I figured that part out btw Also I think my breadboard is fucked up in some way The thing is not work
You should still come up to 4w	OK lol I'm coming
I gotta pack tmrw so can we meet up at a later time You and saaketh can go do whatever dw about me	I haven't made plans w saaketh yet Were just going to dunkin btw At 1030am
Oh uh I just woke up	It's OK me too Still wanna comr
Uhh I'll be late I can be there around 11	K That works
Oh it looks like they still have 036 lab	It's not due for a while tho
Yeah I'm walking to campus rn	Amazing
Sorryy I'm late Looks like today was probably the last day I'm leaving today now	Me too 11am flight Glad we got to see each other
Yeah if only we knew	I miss you already dave
i miss you too feels like im not gonna see you for so long	Please don't say that
:((	I'm so sad alrwady I will make sure We see each other
if anything we can pset together over video call or something	OK yes plz what are some memorable moments we had this year
Hmm all I remember are the few times i went to maseeh And we played that one board game there And going to hmart xd for you to buy fruit	LMAO ok visit me more next yar  ok i'm done this is what i was asking you that q for btw
Ohh okay Aw its cute	ahha thanks dave Dave Sir What is the best way for me to check the transcript for certain words Can I use string lib
i used strstr so yeah i think so	wonderful ty also since there's no powerboard wiring anymore should i just directly connect the wire to a digital input pin from LED on the LCD display
uhh im not too sure since i just did it when there was a powerboard but yeah that should work i think	ok great
noooo not like this theres a power 4 why would they do this to us	what you're doing the exercises? omg plz stop
yep	don't torture me like this you know what actually just do them so i can bug u for help later on this is seriously killing me tho
:P	i'm so done with physics
are you doing a pset for 8.02? im also sorta dying from 8.022 physics became a lot harder when you dont have anyone to work with	i gave a weak attempt a few days ago there's still a few that haven't been done yet
its ok i believe in you	:((( i don't i actually don't know how to do the rest
:((	dave i still cannot download the write up file properly it keeps giving it to be with all the weird html tags and not in markdown
for lab6? it might also contain my lab writeup	Thank uuu Rest assured I will delete and write my own Do u know if lab will still be held live
no idea but i dont think so	So no more lab partners? How many more do we even have left Because we have 006 quiz With runs into lab
We only have one more lab I think	Hmm have u done the lab08a yet
Not finished but working on it	ok when u get to the part about passing in things on the esp can u lmk i can't figure out how to pass in the form data to the http request nvm i figured it out lmk if u need help dave do u understand this it's 2017
uhh is this 6.08 practice test? i havent looked at it	yes it's the 2017 midterm oop
hello did you do the 036 hw for this week yet?	uh oh if you're asking me for help that must mean it's hard i haven't started yet
i just realized im a dumbass i accidentally typed a y when they wanted gamma	uhhhhh no is it hard
its sorta long	fffff
and i dont understand the Q shit that well so it was pretty hard for me	oh dear it is game over for me i wonder how saaketh feels carrying my dumbass every week in lab
that is not true	it is definitively
you are one of the smartest ppl i have met	true
genuinely	:oooo what makes u think this lol like i have proven this in zero ways
i feel like its quite the opposite in terms of overall ability i feel like you would be able to do more than anyone else i know	uhhhhhhhh i feel like maybe u just think that bc i complain about literally everything i do so it just seems like i'm v packed in schedule when indeed i am not u sir on the other hand always j chillling
nooo its not the number of things you do	doing extra design exercises finding it interesting
its the fact that i can see you being capable of doing stuff	lol real facts i will stop arguing you and appreciate all your compliments they mean a lot :')
:P	:p i use this emoji too much how has california been
i think you've finally seen the light	wait i really have i like it a lot
its been ok i havent been outside the house in over 3 weeks	legit same some people are michigan were protesting whitmer's extension on stay home thing i was like wtf not anyone ik
oh shoot yeah i literally just saw that on the news	"but some people from my school are also just like driving everywhere and going out a lot (""socially distanced"") but like hello risky"
yeah idk what ppl are doing i guess there are quite a bit of ppl in my area that dont seem to really care its actually pretty funny how i feel like theres more ppl walking around the neighborhoods and at the park i think ppl have interpreted the stay at home thing to be more like dont go far so they are around the neighborhood more often	lol yeah actually i feel that too my backyard has been my only outside time but i haven't been there in a while too it's cold here lol we've been having snow storms
unrelateable tbh	would it ever be lol i heard yall get like a speck of snow and cancel school lol
in southern california we dont get snow xd what have you been up to? all that i know is that quarantine might be screwing with my head all the confessions about being deprived of physical touch are too real	i am lonely boi i fucked around while i was on break and didn't get back into it recently but now i'm pretty busy because i either sleep or take so long to get ready/eat in the morning that ilke half my day is gone sometimes i just sit there doing miscellaneous work that doesn't even matter and it's a time sink too this is factual i feel like i'm in limbo
that is also mee if i dont have anything ill wake up at 11 and then it takes me an hour to eat breakfast/get ready to do stuff and then i look at the clock and i think well time for lunch i guess	LOL you're so right omg i actually feel like this dude theres 5 parts to the fucking homework fuck
yeah its pretty long	don't make me feel worse :((
oh no im sorry  here is a dog to make you feel better :P	Omg I thought u were going to send me a picture of a real doggo And I was super excited
aw man sorry to disappoint again uhh i dont have dog	This is still nice tho I appreciate the sentiment I wish I had a pupper Also why again What is this about what
nothing dont worry about it	R u doing well lol
yeah im ok but theres a lot of work physics is hard econ is hard coding is hard :(((	Yeah I feel like my productivity is way dowb Takes a lot of time to do Anything
despite all of this im watching youtube oh well	That is honestly the moce What r u watching these days Oh give me song recs TV recs movie recs book recs Anything reallt Lifestyle recs
hmm i was watching lucifer on netflix idk if you have netflix tho	I don't but I can probably find it if it's not too new how do i pass in the previous output to the state rounding state like the state thingie
i think i did an identity matrix but shifted the ones? let me just see what i put	but like how do i get the dimensions to match up then if state is like a 3 x 1 and how would i get y_t-1 from like the output of the prev func
let me look up my code	okie ty
yeah i did a 3x3 matrix for wss and wo so that way you maintain a 3x1 vector	are u passing in a 1 x 3 then o ye
yeah matrix comes first	oh right backwards uhhhh wait i still don't understand what you'd put in the first position for the state tho cuz like u need to keep track of the outputs but i don't see how u get the output back into the state
i do the calculation for the new state in my wss and when i want to output something my wo just takes my input and yeets the top value off or technically my f2 does that so my wo is just identity	oml this is confusing ok i'm still a little confused but i'll try that ugh so did i tell u my retainers broke the other day so i was told to just wear my old ones but they're so much tighter than my current ones because when i got the current ones made my teeth were lowkey not in the right spots anymore and i just put them on like half an hour an immediately i've become extremely irritable i literally got so annoyed at my hw just now after scrolling down and finding all this Q and mdp bullshit
awww oh nooo yeah i really hate it when retainers dont fit well are you still gonna just wear your old ones then? o yeah i also scroll down all the way each time to see how much mental pain to brace for	well i felt kind of guilty for not wearing them for like the past few days i think i ran out of bracing energy for the day i didn't realize how much effort it takes to be sane while wearing these retainers and it took like all the fight out of me lol well rather than them not fitting well i think it's just my teeth aren't really right anymore lol
oh what the heck why do you need to wear retainers during the day	cuz they probably moved a bit every night i didn't wear my retainers i mean it's 2am my friend so it's not really during the day
oh	i already brushed my teeth
right timezones are a thing	i mean it's not early over there either i've officially given up which is tragic i'll try again tmrw i am almost done with part 2 just 3 more torturous sections on material i don't know!
yeah its probably a good idea to sleep	i will do that yes but please help me dave not like now but i'll probably bother u again sometime with questions
noo its not a bother	let me rephrase it will be a bother to help me probably but i am not the bother the help is the bother hmm idk if that made sense i'm gonna sleep now
good idea goodnight :P	ehe :p gn
 wow erik demaine said your name :P	bro whqt i watched this led lec when did he say it
 new link closer to the time im sorry this is a very shree thing you gotta pay close attention :P	holy hollyyyyy i can't believe u did this this is like dad joke of the highest order that is an ok thing
yeah now you know what i was thinking for the rest of that lecture	omfgggggg why u do this
gotta stay entertained during lecture somehow	lol u don't think erik demaine is interesting???? also i have lab tmrw morning rip wanna help a friend out with 3d on the exercises
Uh I havent done them yet rip	oh riperoni ok i'll let u know then
fuck fuck fuck im so sad so many psets so little time	:(((( same bro same
i am about to start 036 lab and i heard its not a fun time	u mean the hw?
hw* yeah	yeah it's not really lmk if u need help
the only thing giving me energy at this point is the fact that this is the second to last one	oh shit it is????? dammit i'm blessed
i think so	what are we doing for the next two weeks after next week then
well i mean technically finals start in 2 weeks	dude don't technically me i'm not mentally prepared for this trauma yet 006 results today kind of already scarred me
yeah same :( its okay im sure you did fine	:( it was mediocre performance by jamie
your mediocre performance is much better than most	dave sir you have much higher standards than me
i highly doubt it	just so you know i kind of want to fight you rn because you're always giving me shit about underselling myself and look at this LOOK AT THIS i'm going to fight you like physically fly to socal take a nice coronacation then fight you
i think i speak the truth so if you want to fight me because i see the truth then go ahead :P this is so funny for some reason what am i looking at exactly :P you clearly not being able to fight me i have half the of the US as a shield	i think my 6 angry reacts tell u enough
aw okay sorryy i will stop for now until the next time that is :P	:oooo how dare u daviddddddddddd life is lonely in quarantine me sad and lonely boi
it is quite lonely i am also lonely	:(((( wanna pset with me and the hoes tmrw 006 all afternoon hit us up
is that how you refer to your roommates?	"idk do u like any of my otehr friends uhhhhhh yes all of my friends referred to as a collective in third person is the ""hoes"""
i dont think i know any of them well and also i need to do 8.022 tmrw	it'll be like jianna claire anjalie ben
so i probably wont get around 006 until later	probably booo good luck with 022 how has that been so far i'm sleeping so much these days
until recently it was okay	like the last 3 days esp
and now idk wtf is happening in the class	but for some reason i have all these eye bags rn oh rip same and i'm in 8.02 like i exhausted all my e&m knowledge and now they're teaching stuff i've never seen so it's kind of bad because i'm approaching it as if i know it and i don't wait like legit last week i didn't really sleep and my eye bags were fine like i felt fine but these last few days idk what's up i am a low functioning bean of a human
its your body telling you to sleep even more :P its okay at least you didnt pull a me i was late to our 6.08 group checkoff meeting xd because i was asleep and everyone in my group was calling me but my phone was on airplane mode	:oooo who's in your group what project r u guys doing btw i feel like even though ours isn't easy joe is always disappointed in us :(( i feel like it's not that easy but also i wasn't trying to be super ambitious with it also what time was this lol
im in a group with shree michelle tian and anjali 9 am	cuz i was imagining it like our checoff time which is 9:30pm oh lol that's quite different oh idk michelle i think i've met anjali is she the third anjali in maseeh
no shes in new grace's roommate	oh maybe idk her i met grace before right
uhh no idea honestly lol	on stud 5?
oh yeah!	is it 14.01 grace
that was grace yep	dude wow my memory amazing
alright alright i gotta stop putting off doing 036 i always just airplane mode everything when i need to do work	ok bye good luck that's smart omggggg david u can play codenames online i totally didn't register that fact let's please play after 006
sounds like a good idea	hows you're 006 studying going your
nonexistent so far i gotta do 6.08 our group is lowkey screwed	oh rip how's your project coming oh
we havent finished most of our milestones and its due tn	eek did u guys pick something really complicated
its not that bad but just kinda annoying i guess	i think out of most of the groups we must have picked a relatively easy one because everytime joe calls us i feel like he thinks ouur work is trivial lol
but also joe does this stuff a lot so i think he would feel that most of our projects are pretty trivial	we were about wrapped up like end of last week too lol so we basically just finished some stuff up for a working system this week which he wanted technically last week yeah ig good luck daveeeee
tyy almost the end of the term already :(	bad or good thing?
idk i guess im just a bit scared	why what's up
since i need to find something good to do with my time after classes are done	oh i see i feeel like you shouldn't put that much pressure on yourself cuz otherwise you'll just feel bad all summer lol idk i feel like you can just pursue smth fun or meaningful for the sake of it being fun
yeah thats true mehh idkk	i'll be chilling at home all summer too so hmu all the time lol me and a few other kiddos applied to hacklodge which is end of aug it's in bay area this year so maybe u should take short trip up????
is hacklodges a hackathon?	it's like a weeklong lodge hackathon soort of thing u just work on a product for a week i didn't want to do it originally because i had no ideas but david lu asked me and since i figured i was just being a bean of a human i said ye also i feel like i need to focus on building up some more diverse and technical skills before i can be too ambitious with getting myself involved in all these projects and then not having time to actually learn these things it's a big mood in hack rn lol i have really only learned like a few things about flask and react js just exists to a point where i can read but not write it
yeah i completely relate to the feeling that i should probably learn the basic technical aspects	:pp
:p	hehe yeah so that's the goal this usmmer
im going to go work on 6.08 but lmk what time tmrw?	oh i didn't mean we have to play codenames like immediately but we can i have the weekly 6.08 meeting at 9:30pm after the exam anyways also i'm kind of fucked for 036 i realized allso i'm taking 9.00 this term remember and since we went online the exams have been open for a weeka dn open book open computer so i've been googling the questions to answer them for each of them recently gabrieli told us our third exam according to institute policies has to be timed for 3 hours sooooo i might actually have to learn some things for this one ahead of time otherwise i might not even be able to search up all the answers fast enough
Ohh okay yeah that's cool just lmk whenever you have time then fb is not adding the care react to messenger so i am taking matters into my own hands	omg your're so funny i appreciate it hi there
hii how was your week?	it was moderately decent i was doing ok until 006 tbh i got wrecked lol i panicked midway through and just brain did not compute f
its okay me too im really slow at dp so i sat there for 30 mins thinking and couldnt figure out what to do basically xd	it's ok dave we'll all go down together F's around
F its okayy this is why its pene xd o yeah also i went to the beach a couple days ago at night when there were less ppl because we have the bioluminescnet tide rn	omfg i'm so jealous i'm so so jealous i love the beachi i'm cursed to live in forest land which i enjoy tooo but i love the beach omg
the beach is too overrated	i don't even get to go thtat often cuz my parents don't like traveling that much
its so uncomfy	no stopp
sand gets everywhere	it's so peaceful and serene when there's no people tho that's true but that's like the aesthetic
yeah i guess thats true but idk if ive been on a beach with no ppl	like less people dave on #7 on the first practice exam do u know how to do this i don't understand this at all lol
I havent done the practice test yet rip	Rip dave I keep getting wrecked by exams :((
It's okay I'm gonna get screwed over too	I'm not even talking like 036  exams like legit just All exams I've taken so far
Noo itll be okayy	Aww haha I mean I just want it to be over with How many finals do u have
Only 2 006 and 036	Oh nicee
Mostly just worried about 036 So after that I think I'll be mentally done	Lol really? I'm worried about 006 too tho Look at these pictures I just took
Eh yeah but I can pass 006 with a 0 Woww prettyy	Oh I mean u only need a 30 or something on 036
And the same does not go for 036	Yeah that's true
Uhh yeah but at this point idk anymore	I shouldnt be saying that lol the practice exam I've been trying to meander through all day has been wrecking me Whatcha doing over the summer tho
Still dont really know I think I'll definitely be doing a bit of usaco See if I can use 006 knowledge to get a bit further Itll also probably be good practice for 009	oh nice yeah idk how the curriculum changed but adam hartz seems to have changed the curriculum quite a bit i just repeated myself
my head hurts :(	same did u start looking at the practices? i felt the exact same way i felt so helpless i couldn't even understand the questions also do you think humans are closer to demons or angels
probably demons	why do u think that
maybe due to some introspection	hmm yeah i just felt the need to ask somebody this bc i just read something that was like demons have heartbeats and angels are cold with only their halos to provide any sort of warmth i was like tf and then i was like hmm
what were you reading?	it was a tumblr post lol with that as the entirety of its contents
ah i see of course	if u want a book rec tho u should read the three body problem
i trust it	also have u listened to nct's recent album
no i havent is it good?	both of them are yes well like i feel like the title song isn't really your taste not that i know what your taste is but u should read the three body problem for sure and listen to maybe boom from the album
i will take a look	i think bazzi produced that song
today morning one of my neighbors thought it was a good idea to do some yard renovations at 9	lmao what what kind of renovations
all i know is that i woke up to the sound of a jackhammer and now im tired and sad	wait no i'm being legit bazzi actually produced the song boom by nct 127 everybodys bored out of their mind rip same but i made my mom try to wake me up at 9 today i didn't get up until 10 tho and i just felt miserable the entire first half of the day
their album is good and yeah i guess you are right i dont like their title song as much love again and puzzle piece were good tho	Oh you're listening to the nct dream album I meant the nct 127 album oh rip that one isn't as recent I just confused u lol I like love again too tho Love song from the nct 127 has similar vibes
ohh oops yeah i just went onto youtube and found the most recent one	yee they have a lot of releases going on rn lol another repackage is set to come out in a week
o what the heck thats so many hmm maybe more productive during qurantine lol	black plague innovation vibes they have a lot of units but some members overlap so they're really getting overworked i'm definitely not tho so idk how this works
its okay tho! today is last day of classes i would be happy but we havent turned in 608 yet xd	people are like celebrating but like i haven't felt anything different i haven't attended class in a while oh rip good luck you still have until 5am
yeah altho id prefer if i didnt have to stay up until then	my team has been mia so i just checked our report over today and turned it in that makes sense
im supposed to record a final video of all the functionality and it took me 20 tries to just to record the weekly deliverable ones	oh no :(( did it work out ok in the end oh i heard next housing lottery came out how'd that go for u
o yeah housing lottery was a shit show but it worked out better than last time	i saw a confession about this lol is this like for you in particular or in general
theres a dumb policy of rooms not opening up until the previous people get their new room all of 4W lol because everyone was staying and we didnt have enough seniors	oh no :( rip
the people had no rooms to choose from in the beginning so no one could get a new room the people who wanted to move out were later in the lottery	damn really? so yall squatting that triple?
no kevin and i are in a double now	why don't they put them first lol
no idea lol	ya'll kicked frank to the curb like that huh
no he's rooming with saaketh	oh wait really lit
yee	did saaketh move to next omg soo lit
yeah	damn all the homies in next now
yepp technically frank and saaketh are in our old triple but as a double currently so idk how thats gonna work out	damn niceee
yeahh what are your housing plans for next year?	did u guys want to stay on 4w
yeah	dunno maseeh has been absolutely dead for the past month housing stuff comes out apparently later? i'm tryna stay on 6 but in a double this time the view is nice and it's nice and peaceful
with anjali?	yeah but 6 is kinda dead tbh we considered moving to 5 but like 5 is a party floor and a lot of them are staying so i have some concerns maybe some of the freshies will spice it up on 6 next year if we're even on campus rip i'm getting ahead of myself all the guys in the quad across the hall are moving out tho rip
are they going to live with frats?	yeah tai and ben are zbt milo is zeta psi and robert is basically in a frat with some of his bc homies
aw i see rip	yeah and u know me i hate travel or movement and exercise so i'll just never see them again ig or you for that matter lmao
nooooo	LOL jk no
wtfff	i will make an effort LOL
i will too	ok good good
you know zbt has frequent parties you can see them then :P	omg dude i'm like mentally clocked out by 10pm dude ben hates parties lol whenever he has to work them he tries to do coatroom when it's warm so nobody bothers him and he can do his hw
so old :P	dude i'm already washed up
its okayy me too	nah you're still youthful full of life
i did have a minor existential crisis recently when i realized i have the taste of a child	uh oh what
so unsophisticated	in what way
i like sweet things and nothing thats more refined meaning i dont like coffee flavored things, or green tea	haha i think that just means you have vanilla taste
i like strawberry flavored things okay find i guess i can live with the fact that im asic basic* fine(	haha it's just like you're not that intense intense flavors are for people a little bitter inside it's good to have the useful innocence youthful* omg
mm yeah i guess aw man i gotta go code now i think we are almost there	ok go go good luck
oof looks like im still awake doing 608 things xd cutting it real close	Damn did u make it I was gonna make up early again to study but I had no kotivation
Yeah our team made it but not me :p	Wdym not u :((
uhh i may or may not have forgotten the individual writeup	oh man lol how much is that worth
no idea but i just ended up emailing it to our ta's and he said its probably fine so he submitted it for me late	Yay that's good
It has been a while	:oooo Delivered? Am jealous
No I went and bought it It was my mom's birthday	oh really? today was my brother's birthday also this was in my 9.00 slides
hahaha california is great i agree	I was attacked
rightfully so	Happy birthday to your mom tho
ty she is half a century old but she didnt like that when i commented that she's like why are you making me feel so old	LOL Now why would u go and do such a thing
hey if i were 50 i think it would be cool to realize im half a century old difference in perspectives i guess or maybe idk maybe it gets a lot more depressing when you are actually 50	Haha I mean I got this question the other day If you could be 9ne age for the rest of your life what age would that be
Hmmm maybe 22? Seems like a good age	:o I said 21
Nice so you can drink?	not really like 21 is sort of the age where you're still youthful but it's not like emerging adulthood so much anymore so like i could be doing anything i could be in college i could have a job and a life or i could still be bumming around
Ah okay I see you'll still have freedom:p :p	:PP and taxes
Also relevant One of our car batteries died So now I'm sitting in the other car while my brother is jumping the car	you've been actually using the cars? oh rip lol i keep forgetting you have a brother that's like david sized too imagine having two sons that are just tall wow crazy wait are you outside rn
No so I guess that's why the battery died lol	or just at home trying to jump the car oh makes sense lol
No I'm in the driveway	did u give up on 036
I'll probably study some this afternoon My head was hurting yesterday so I didnt really feel like doing anything	are u ok
Yeah I think I'm fine According google I have a brain tumor :p Always fun to google your symptoms to see people telling you you are dying	yeah wait for real self diagnosis is not the move although i will say i successfully self diagnosed myself with contact dermatitis
What is that? Some skin thing?	lol ok no i don't have an official diagnosis but my doctor basically confirmed it it's just like my skin is sensitive to like fragranced things face masks sadly :( etc etc
Aww I see Yayyy the car started	yayyyyyy did u know how to jump cars before i've seen people do it but i don't know how to do it myself also m y parents haven't let me drive since i went to college bc i don't have insurance anymore so like literally i'm licensed but can't drive
I did it once before	have u ever been to a drive through movie
Nopee	oh they're super fun you should go to one sometime but u just reminded me of that because most people user their car radios to play the audio but that drains the battery we'd have to start the car in between movies to make sure the battery didn't die and sometimes other people would hae to jumpstart somebody else's car
I dont even know if there is one near me But yeah that does sound fun	lol yeah i feel like they're not very popular anymore
you are probably not awake but quick question for 036 if the percpetron outputs a 0 thats always wrong no matter if the actual label is +1 or -1 right?	Wdym by outputs a 0 But I think it depends Like u mean if it's on the line right
Like theta times x is 0 With no offset	I think it depends on what your perception classifies as But like yeah pr9bably Wait no The alg from our notes says If it's equal to its wrong yeah
Oh okay cool Tyy	Yee I'm so over this exam Like I wish I could time travel to after this exam
Yeah me too But its okayy Soon it will all be over	Haha soooon I'm not gonna study for my other finals tn lol daveeeeee i have a question regarding physics if u know anything about this at all any guidance would be appreciated
Yeah del cross e equals db/dt	Whats del cross e
The curl	Like I don't know the derivation but Wait what OK that seems complicated
The curl of e is -db/dt Its one of Maxwell's equations	Wait what is curl again Like it's wave equations so From class the way they've been deriving it is totally different
It should be the curl with respect to x y and z So you have dx dy dz cross your e field	OK this is like Over my head I was just gonna ask Why it becomes negative
It's like how for faraday's law of induction its negative Since it's the opposite to restore the flux	Cuz the answer is just like E0/c times the cos - the E0/c times the cos And like I don't get why the middle term becomes negative But the first time stays positive They said it has to do with like The kz + wt
Hm I mean if you do a cross product The second term is negative the deteminant So I guess mathematically that sorta makes sense?	Uhhhh Ok lol
Maybe if I get a chance I can try to do it	I feel like this didn't make sense to me because I don't really like derive any of my answers in this class
Probably better than me trying to explain it	We just like plug and chug so It's OK lol thank you I'm realizing now that I don't understand physics calculus and it's a little late for me to learn alas
Yeah hm idk then I only know how to explain it from Maxwell's equations and I guess idk the intuition	Lol thanks tho dave Im just cramming for Mondays final I feel like u and I understand Maxwell's equations very differently Ripp OK whatever it's fine I'm so don't with the class Done
Good luckk I'm sure you'll do great	Somehow I feel like that's not what it's looking like
nono you will do well my brain shut down for a second so the first message i sent didnt make sense	Lol I didn't see it so no worries The fact that people use the removed a message feature is still wild to me I don't have that sort of like conscientiousness
I don't usually use it either but what I said made absolutely no sense Its one of those moments you are typing out a thought and change your mind in the middle So then everything gets screwed up since the first part of the sentence doesnt line up	lol ok i believe you sometimes when i'm talking to somebody and texting that happens to me
i heard you have 8.02 tmrw good luckk :P almost there	Didn't I tell u I have 8.02 tmrw But Thank you
Oops sorry I must've forgot	Lolll Thanks tho dave It went well I just took a nap Was not intending to But oh well
naps are good and yeah im happy it went well :P	Oof should have been studying but I lost all motivation asap I woke up kinda early to take 8.02 today so I could study later in the day But it turns out I just went back to sleep afterwards lol
It's okay at this point I'm happy if I've done one productive thing each day	you crack me up Lol isn't there an emoji for this now Why are u always sending me a picture of it
Is there? I havent found it	Wish Woah Wheres the new heart react coming from
You can long press the normal heart react And itll ask you if you want to change it	Holy shit that's fucking wild That's crazy Why are there hidden features
No idea lol	How's studying going for 006
I havent done much yet but I'll probably look at some study guides tn After 036 I sorta stopped doing anything	Were almost there Ugh I've wanted to do more things in this entire week than 8 have in the entire last semester So it just sucks Cuz now I want to do much but I don't have time
I guess soon you'll have time	I feel like after I won't want to do anything after. Tho It's just my Not wanting to study The practice finals have all been really hard
That doesnt sound like you I think you will somehow maintain some motivation	Feeling like this at the moment
Aww itll be okayy	It's called lazy So merp Also u can make an avatar like for Snapchat now On fb Stickers Lmfao
O what the heck	lol does it look like me also are we responsible for heap sort i can't remember anymore like do we have to know its properties there's a question on sp18 about ti
idk probably not anything too specific	cuz i don't know how heap sort works
oof yeah me neither its been a bit too long	There are too many people studying for tomorrow's exam please save me curve
i think you will be fine no matter what :P jamiee are you free tmrw? ophelia says she's down to play codenames then	yeah i'm down i have some stuff going on during the day i'm free 6-9pm edt and after 10pm edt
Okay I'll let ophelia know	yessss exciting how was 006
Not good My brain was not functioning Probably did pretty shit but oh well	Eh you passed it's ok MB for bringing it up The school's over  dave dave dave compare w me

smhhh	omfg consider me too please
huh i was just saying your life is too buzy!	ugh no can do
well I sincerely hope that in mit you will finally just chill make boyfriend go drink and party	omfg no i will not be doing any of the above
???????? didnt your parents talk about marrige yet im sure they will soon	"my mom wants me to get a bf yeah ig idrk she says you have to date to find out the type of boy u like and this was like half a year ago she said this to me and ""college is the best time to find someone"" but at the same time she wants me to ""stay focused and be happy?"""
lmao the contradicting words	my dad is pretty much just like clueless doesn't say anything but he def doesn't wnat me to get a bf probably cuz my older cousin has too many failed relationships
you really should look harder next semester	jesus christ
mit boys get rich	i'm not looking okay also i think that personally there's no one out there that can deal with my shit there's only so many good people in the word yanno and like my incapability to
lol we deal with your shit me and saranya	okay yes but that's a different type of shit like there's friend shit then there's like value shit like ok how do i explain this
anywau the point is start	like inherently i'm such an ass because i have such like a low tolerance for other people's shit
looking	when i have all these bad qualities myself like sorry not low tolerance
at least you acknowledge?	like if i see someone with a trait that i don't think matches me i just think at some point that would be something that causes conflict and i wouldn't spend the rest of my life with them and i won't date anyone if i think the relationship will fail at some point do u see also i don't really understand how two people all of a sudden are dating like what a concept how does that happen what are feelings
its trial and error dumbarse you gotta start loving other ppl	i view the whole thing from the cynic's angle
and you will see	love isn't real
WHOEA	LMAO
you just insulted basicallu entire population what an mit material	i'm not afraid of trial and error but i just think it's so time consuming and i would know in my heart if it was worth it or not and i don't want to date anyone unless i know i know and i don't know anything which happens to be a problem also the fact that love isn't real that too
yea see at one point you will be forced to tru mew stuff or otherwise you will endup in a grave alone how sad is that	lol see that's the thing tho like i could see myself living it out alone because the likelihood of finding someone is just so small
noooooo no no thwts soo sad	no it's true i've held this viewpoint for like several years already
whos gonna watch over yoi	my doggo i'm going to get a doggo
that still doesnt qualify	realistically because i'm me i know i'm not a person suited to understand someone else and be in a relationship like i'm just suited for it
lol you can def find jamie 2.0 but male in miy	id be bad at it not suited*
so you basically just said you are cold hearted bitch	why are we talking about this again
because its soo funny	why is my philosophy iportant again
bruhhh you matter	i'm not cold hearted
thats ehy!	there's a different difference*
at least	i think that my heart doesn't have the same amount of capacity to give and receive as other people
try	that's the difference
lol dont define yourself just try different things	wtf life is about defining yourself
no like dont just say I dont want this or I cant do tjis you may change as person	also i just feel like i would know the difference between infatuation and if i really wanted to be with someone i feel like i see so often people rush into things without knowing anything or considering anything maybe it's fine for them yeah i could change that's true will i tho i guess i just don't have a lot of faith in the real world it's only nice to read about in books wow thanks for having this deep discussion with me and helping me quantify my philosophy further now i feel like i can explain it with even more clarity
UHHHH thats not what I intended st all infact its opposite of that anyways START LOOKING YOU FKIN COLD HEARTED PESSIMISTIC BITCH	LOL i know the last part i was just joking i think it's nice to have a sunnier view of things i won't look though
im just sad because I can see you as an old grandma all alone on a porch!! doggo makes the picture look better but if i do the math right from now on you need at least 5 different dogs to suit your lifespan	LOL it's okay i'm not at that point in life yet when it comes it comes don't be sad lmao some people are very happy to live alone plus it's not like if i don't get a bf
I feel like crying now soo saf	i won't have friends anywayas anywmore * omg
you arent gonna live with your friends dumbarse	dude chill out i know but that's nbd
you can live in my basement	u never know i get stumble upon the perfect person as soon as i step foot on campus highly unlikely but i thought u were the one that has faith right wow lilving in your basement sounds even sadder i'd rather not
LMAO well you can keep us updatrd on your dating experience while in a nerdy mit	there probably won't be any news but sure i guess lmao i feel like you'll have more news to share on your end that's the thing tho some people WANT to date and me i'm just like eh
WHAT A NERD NERD NERDFU	omfg
Jerdfu	alright thanks i get it
dorky fu yea well your mum will be disappointed for not seeing grandson! or grandaughter but ofc chinese ppl love boys better just adopt one	she has a son you know he'll find someone besides women don't pass on their last name fuck the patriarchy
the more the better	i'm not having kids
tf tf tf tf tf ok thats it Im never inviting you to family dinner if we jave one	lol ok i don't know about htat one to be honest but rn at least with my cynical perspective probably cuz i don't even have someone i really like rn i just don't see it having kids sounds so painful too
lol have you ever had someone	like have u ever thought about the struggle
in mind	like in kindergarten sure like sort of in 4th grade i shut down infatuations pretty fast
tf doesmr count	i'm good at that lol eh it be like that tho
this further reinforces the conclusion that you may have cold jeart or no heart at all and rely on artificial one	lol no i told u there's a difference i don't have a cold heart because i really do like the idea of love
so you are like a robot who loves the concept love but cant feel it coz you yourself dont have a heart this a novel worthy story write a book about this tragedy	omfg i never said i couldn't feel it dumbass jeez you're thinking about this too deeply it's just a philosophy dude dwa i
it just helps us understand you more as a specimen you know	who's us lmfao ok so it's interesting tho right
the normal human beings	hey u don't know if there's a lot of people like me out there
im super pessimistic but even i cant grasp your ideologies	it's totally possible it's not even pessimistic it's just a reflection of what i believe to be realistic for myself nothing about otheres just for myself
whats most important to you if love isnt yiur priority	i guess the ultimate goal is to be happy or content satisfied but that doesn't just happen when you're in love ig ideally it would be part of it but not necessarily
what makes you happy then	A lot of things Not necessarily love
like nothing	… No…
huhhh	What
still busy?	Taking an early night today I'm worn out
why	Idk I just feel all worn out today It was a long day full of not great happenings
so basically another busy jamie day	Well yeah Not so different But idk for some reason I couldn't keep doing my work so I just stopped
thats called being worn out wonder whyy 🤔 you workaholic	Nahhhh I gotta catch up real quick Wish I could get some days off work
well ask do you really want to work the entire time when this is one of the last days in michigan sometimes you need to have life	I'll have a few days no work I want to end a little early but I don't know if I can
stop being stressed by work and chill jamiefu jesus thats how you die early you wont get to have doggos at this rate would be dead before that	Lol I'm stressed about studying not wofk Work is just time consuming
same thing go out with people more just forget about responsibilities!	No I can't. Id just go out and worey Which is worse
you know I think since you live once you should like just fuck around as much as you want like you wonr be a lil jamie again you will be old tired jamie by that point you cant even go out coz you are too tired enjoy while you can	That's the thing tho U should experience things u want to experience I don't want to go out all the time I'm fine as I am It would be worse for me if I forced myself to do things I didn't want to Right
still  you should try to broaden your experience? you never know what you would enjoy for example i hated alcohol till like 3 years afo now im a alcoholic	OK lol I don't know If that's good
hey. its good im just preparing you for college	I won't drink

wow that took time	I think that's pretty true actually I was thinking of the best word
ofc.	I'm so swamped tn tho Can we do this Next week I have a lot of work to do still
sure why are you so busy these harvard ppl are chillin	Homework and club shit Harvard is a fake school
"""mit is frat school"" is what he said"	he's just saying that because we throw better parties
but again	and we manage to learn stuff too
you dont go single party so does it matter	to me? no but to him ? more likely
im fed up with public institutions	What happened
the class i tried to enroll into this dumbass professor read the email and didnt respond so another person took the motherfucking spot now im very fucked because there arent many options available and the advisors are basically nonexistant just telling obvious shit and not being helpful like saranya gives more helpful advice than these fools	U have to accept that tho A professor is not obligated to respond to u immediately Remember you're asking him for a favor Not the other way around So u have to suck it up until u get to be in that position Fend for yourself dongha !
which is arrogant and dumb you being professor doesnt kean	Professors are busy dongha
you can read the email and not respond when its actually urgent not this one	It's not like he didn't mean to not respond
nope	And how can he classify your urgency as important to u
its she and yes she did mean not to respond	She *
i literally talked to her after her class the reason ehy she left ke on read was because somebody emailed an hour before the more of reason to tell me its unavailable	Again She has no obligation To tell you that Ofc it's inconvenient But her job isn't to make your life more convenient
thats called being asshole	No dongha it's called being in a position of higher power Her time in a day is pimited Emails always go ignored in academia
why are we paying tuition to keep this institution runnjng ofc she can ignore me if im not a student but im literally paying a tuition so she can eat and sleep she does have some obligation and try not to be an asshole when a relationship between student and prof involves money we pay for the service you being prof doesnt mean you can just walk around jacking off and comeon she majors in dutch she aint busy WOW THIS OTHER PROFESSOR IS SOO MICH HELPFUL SHE ACTUALLY REPLIED TO EMAIL AND SOLVED PROBLEM FOR ME THIS IS WHAT PPL SHOULD DO WHEN THEY GET FUCKIN PAID BY US	Dongha you're going to be an unhappy student if u keep this mindset Life is not handed to u even if u pay money It's just an opportunity I'm just saying having lower expectations will make u happier
lol this is exactly why this society is failing systematically everybody thinks you can do whatever you want when you are in high position university education is a monetary transaction between student and the institution and I didnt even ask that much you being the student doesnt mean you can ask for what you deserve just because they are prof especially when im not a gsi or something htat actually has vertical relationship with your prof	Bro whatever I made an attempt to help but this is just making yourself suffer No can do man
im actually just going to kill myself when i go back korea people there are just assholes	Omg Stop
i think im too naive and nice to survive	You are naive and nice So man up
i show too much weakness	Omg You're going to be OK dongha It's just a learning process
lol how is that learning process ive seen graduate students get ass raped by their psycopathic professors my dad wants me to do graduate school but i dont think i will sirvive especially in korea	Omg youre going to be fine I mean you're going to learn how to live through college struggles
naw man this society is too messed up everyone is either dumbass that gets used or smartass who abuse the shit out of others even this tiny ass korean communities in umich has vertical relationships and i cant stand that idk how i lived for 16 years there	That's the point of society?
nope it isnt the whole purpose of society is to make sure ppl dont fuck each other up so that we can all survive this harsh world hi jamir hows your life	Not good
why	Busy
eh	Eh
did you drink did you get a boyfriend no?	No and no
yikess umich is funn	It is
why are you mit come aa	Yeah ikr can u recommend me location DONGHA
wurs dis well	for my january free period i want to travel to korea!!!
theres lots of chinese tourist in jeju and its kinda pricy	i don't want to be isolated
well if you want to go seoul at one point	what location should i pick
i suggest pangyo or songdo orphanage its for a good cause and its pretty close to seoul so you can do shit	there's not that much free time i was going to do pangyo then future lab cuz u rank two songdo idk if i can do tho because my korean speaking ablility is not that high is songdo the boys town/girls town
whatabout yeomyung	it's all the way in busan though same thing for yeomyung i don't have the language capability i like the idea though but i think i'm not suited
you speak chinese and english	their chinese can't be that much better than their korean though like north korea is still north korea
well tbh since you dont speak korean i assume you would prefer international school that would be easier	hmm yeah i'm open to other things but idk how feasible it would be what do u think about FL though since you agree with pangyo also
isnt it sketch its recently built actually it sounds fun but i think lots of ppl would want that	 is it this one? oh really? hm see idk if i should go for something i think is interesting but less popular or if i should go with something that aligns with my abilities
well i feel like you wont get to choose anyways	yes but i need to rank two anyways
well do fl but dont do jeju everytjing else you decide	wait what does your ranking look like what u think is best for me
fl	and then?
one of the international	so pangyo/jeju? but u said no jeju so just pangyo?
o yea	hmm ok i think it'd be fun to work in an actual school though because FL sounds like students sign up to take classes or stuff with us
hmm	so while they will be motivated i feel like it'd be cool to see all sorts of students instead of ones that just sign up what do u think of pangyo then FL is it still a good decision i just wnat to know if i'm making any bad decisions or missing out on any opportunities i guess
i mean out of those those two are the better looking ones	okieeee thann ks bbb
hi im drunk	Boii Did u sleep yet
no im not home	Omg go home drink water and sleep

im actually not fit for comsci i got slightly above avg for eecs280 even if i consider the fact that im freshman thats still bad	it doesn't matter when you start just how much work u put in or where you go
its not a stsrt tho	yes it is shut up
but i have very big vision if im to fulfull it i should do something im actually good at	what is your vision
be super super rich so i can do stuff like make institution buy companies donate build cities and so on	that's just lilke a money goal though like what do u want to do other than money
i just listed money is tool	Ok But what do u want to learn
learning wise? i like all the stem stuff but i dont like busywork im more like a theory person also interested in finance history language and so forth this is the problem im interesten in too much stuff i cant dig one hole and i feel like if u want to succeed in cs u either have to be super smart or super nerdy	Objectively not true U can study whatever u want But make sure u want to do it
i dont want to major in anything i like everything i hate college	Damn me too
shutup mit even being the dumbest in class is ok in mit	i don't think that's relevant to your concerns though i feel like your thing is that you're not sure what you wanna do and also just to be clear there are very few people born geniuses
your life has been decided sjnce day 1	likely most people who u think is genius is actually built upon many hours or years of hard work uh that is also objectively false
your gene defines who you are with some exceptions cuz of mutatiob	ugh nvm
what you think im joking	no but i have to take this quiz in a bit so i need to exit
lol goodluck	Thanksss
dude holy fk i just realized my international friends are rich asf like rich rich wr talking about my dad*10 rich	Lollll Yeah if an international kid comes to the us Chances are they're rich af where are you text me here
apt	whose why can't u get back where
i  cnant walk homr	do u feel that sick who is with you do u know who is where or at least one person that is in charge
no i cant see im fine though ill recover	wdym you can't see
within hour blurry	do u have your glasses on??? is it because you're dizzy
ye	are there people near you don't need to be people u know
i know most of em	are they also drunk
cant tell	are u indoors and sitting or laying down somewhere
ye sittin	what are the otehr people around u doing is the party still going on
drinkin gMe	did u drink any water
i cant i would thro2 up	get the fucking alcohol out of your system then go to the bathroom and throw it up it's better to get it out
eww no	why not
trust me	u really want it to stay there? you can't even walk back to west
throwin up doesnt help i need time to recover	you need to drink water and eat something at least can u ask someone to bring you something or go somewhere quiet and lay down please
idk man	do u know where the bathroom is
ye its studio	can you go there you need to throw up dongha physiologically you need to throw up trust me you will feel better recovery can't happen unless u get it out of your system i don't care if it's gross and if u don't want to
shutup throwing is soo gross i need time	listen to me
i will recover	that is not going to exit your system
omg i have more exp trust me	for a while just because one way works doesn't mean another won't and this will be faster the reason u want to throw up is because your body is rejecting whatever is in your system right now how much time are you going to need if u just sit there and let it keep getting into your system versus getting it out now
im not quite there	i do not care literally if it is gross i want u to be able to physically go back to your dorm and rest and if that requires throwing up then do it don't tell me you're going to sit there for a while longer until you feel better because i am telling u that will take at least another hour
i just need time	if u physically cannot go back to the dorm then there is something not good in your system what is the time going to do dongha tell me when are you planning on going back to west
idk	what does that mean
im gaining my consciousness back slowley	and when will it be better
idk half hour	it will go faster if u eat or drink something
no i would throw up trust me	how do u know try it eat it over the toilet if u throw up then fine there's nothing wrong with that
thats gross trust me its disgusti g	why should i when u literally made yourself wasted to the point that u can't even go back to west listen to me i do not care if it is gross i want u to try to eat or drink something and u can try not to throw up but even if u do that is okay because that is normal
you know i cant read when im drunk i got this	do u want to call me if i call u will u pick up
dont call im trying to recover i need time	dpaek missed your call. No just call me I want to hear what u sound like
i cant	U just need to hold the phone to your ear And talk to me
dpaek called you. dpaek called you. wtf why did you tell tae smh mom fu	u fucking idiot do u feel better now at least
wtf. ofc	wdym wtf you were the one that made yourself too drunk to walk yesterday if i were physically there i would smack the shit out of u
bruh i dont go that far you fool	wow are u just in denial
at least i dont run into csr like saranya no i was gonna wait until i sober up and then leave	now you're just in denial
dont even	i'm just saying it's not good for u and how were u going to sober up with all of that alcohol sloshing in your body and don't tell me throwing up didn't help or not eating and sitting there like a dead person helped
bac level decreases as time goes by	yeah what one standard drink takes at least 2 hours to leave your system
drinking water makes you throw up more dumbass	and how many did you have? yeah so just do it just throw up
ew no	omg what is so wrong with throwing up the whole reason someone throws up is because what's in their system needs to not be in their system so stfu omg i literally can't talk to you right now
lmfao classic jfu ehehehe i love you jamie	it's not funny you were literally incapitated i love u too but u need to take better care of yourself and don't just drink your fucking worries away
i dont dumbarse	Ugh wow so u literally don't even have a decent reason to be drinking that much then
for fun	ugh nvm

im not feeling that bad i lowered expectation	honestly that's not a bad thing to do because as long as you're setting realistic goals for yourself your'e ok
might have to retake so if you get below 50 on exam even if you ace project and lab you still fail class	Can u retake the exam Or make it up
nope	do you want to schedule a time to talk to the professor i have heard that if you actually reach out to the professor they can be really helpful and supportive
its just straight up fail i feel like they might lower threshold it was bad	no what happens to you is what you envision what the hell is happening lmfao

i will be fucked in 3 days	oh well u still have 3 days u should use them to study silly
we can finally visit other houses according to the govenor	oh really? there's regulations that are slightly lifted but the stay at home order has still been extended
the travel between houses are now ok but not ub forgot the word	why would u increase your risk tho
so i can die	omg dongha please stop i will talk to u more tmrw i'm exhausted rn tho the personality profile i wrote about you won an award lol i just reread it to see if it was actually that good
???????	and i actually did you dirty lol it was not well written
what have you done what did I ever do to you	yeah novi yearbook submits their yearbook to state competition every year and the results just came in i won first in the personality profile section in division 1
LMAO	i didn't even know they did this LOL
wow jamie idk what to tell you	"ok to be fair yearbook has strict rules about how artful we can make our writing i have to directly quote you i can only use ""said"""
to congratulate or to scold	and it was word-limited lol it's just funny
indeed jamie indeed.	indeed what have u been up to
just relaxing emptying out my brain	that's good lol The fuck You're moving? Dongha Respond to me
uh nct month	What Why R u coming back to umich
yea duh	ok so it's more like a summer vacation
uh sure	So your brother has to go back to Korean hs again?
yes internstional	Oh okay that's good So he's planning on coming to the states for school too
no for college he might	Yeah college I mean
maybe	:(( don't go dongha
when are we seeing each other	Idk man We literally can't
technically yes you can	My parents would never Plus my grandma's home Theyre taking all the precautions
oh my	Yea
jimmy!!	Dinghy!!!
i have soo many nicknames	Haha Yes u do
im takin linalg are you good at linalg	not really i have two friends who are in it now if u want to ask them
when do you depart michigan my dear friend	um never tbh lol
when is the planned deparayure i was not able to secure you a birthday gift i was to amend by bringing gifts from korea upon my return i shall have it delivered	:oo wait are you in korea rn you left already? bitchhhh
what i said NEXT MONTU	OH ok good
I HAVE EXACTLY A MONTH	i thought u lied to me jesus
hehehe	oh shit what do u want for your birthday i don't even know what you're into these days except girls i'm really sorry my finals don't end until this wednesday so i've been really hosed
what who saids so	just in general these are the vibes i'm getting
we shall meet before i depart in to the land of soju	also i can't remember if i got saranya anything for her birthday i don't think i did
questionable	soju lmao
oh i got saranya smth smh	my parents might not allow it
well its a month so who knows maybe the last couple days	i don't doubt it
corona might die down a little	hopefully i hope so too
ok little one go back on your studying we shall talk again soon	thanks dongha haha let's get in touch on thursday or something we can celebrate
	are you in better spirits these days sir
im packing and packing is always saf	:(( oh no it's not really a new beginning tho is it think about it we'll still be here and our doors are always open (after corona)
no you wont be here	i'll be on campus but i come home quick often part of it is for my parents' sanity part of it is for my own wellbeing lol not that this summer won't be more than enough home time
you better not lose contact with me	bitch you wish imma be calling you up once a week to check in on your poppin social life would fly to south korea if i could it sounds so nice there rn in comparison
it is much better than this shithole situation we are in	agreed
korea never enforced stay at home order and yet they dealt corona more effectively	koreans are generally more disciplined imo
even though population density is much higher than us	it's part of your culture lmao
flase	true
koreans are idiots	i read in my psych textbook that east asians have more interdependent cultures so they're better at judging actions relative to others
this is true	whereas americans are very self centered and better at judging absoluteness in a study of relative vs absolute size japanese did better on relative and americans did better on absolute size and when japanese subjects looked at a picture they tended to notice a fish given a background and could revisualize the entire scenery better than americans. but americans could reproduce the fish's characteristics better but didn't look at scenery
japanese ppl are known for extreme interdependent culture even compared to korea and china	yeah that's reallly true tho have u read the three body problem i just thought of it it's a really good sci fi novel written by chinese author i was just reminded because there's a mention of the kamikaze dive bombers and like world war 2 stuff
hmm interesting	yeah you should read it tho the book has nothing to do with japan at all lol or world war 2 it's just mentioned in passing int he second book of the seeries
okok i will little one	:D
happy birthday kiddo	? Its not my birthday Isn't it Max's birthday today Or was that earlier Oh max was earlier It's somebody's birthday today oof I forget no

Jamiee Want to play tennis tomm Or sometime this week Assuming u r back u novi In	i am but i am self-isolating atm how did mit go
I Got Waitlisted	awwwww
How long will u be isolating urself for It’s alr admissions office knows best	about a week :(( where do u wnat to go most
Princeton Stanford	you got into pton right so just waiting on stanny?
Yea I did Yea	nice congrats
Thnx So u would be able to play next week Prob won’t get in to Stanford especially regular but u never know ig	hey u never know yeah uhhh maybe i'm not sure tbh everything is a bit chatoric i'm behind on a lot fo schoolwork
Why what’s wrong :/ U’ll catch up Just stay healthy lol	yeah i'd be down tho at some point yeah i have to
Yea we have plenty of time I read ur blog Which said u still play I have not played in so long Our senior yr kinda turning out to be a lil weird	LOL yeah ik first year turning out kinda weird i am still playing on the off thanks for reading btw
Lolol ‘twas insightful Yea must suck but what can u do	eh i'm not that good of a writer yeah u really can't just gotta have a good time while you can
Oo I see we’ll see what the score is this time around I’ll get clapped I couldn’t serve today I went w srihari LOL	oh definitely not
Yea make the most of the time we have	i'm not good
I shit u not I did not make contact w the ball On 4 tries consecutively on my serve	lol i'm guessing u haven't played since season
Once	eek
And this was the next time w Srihari Ya that loss to Huron in 3 sets after basically having match point kinda made me throw the raquets away	oh eek uhhhh idk what to tell u i didn't really play that much senior year either it was a disappointing season
I mean ur playing club learning at MIT and having fun so it all worked out Injury? They were the one seed too Saketh n I were p sad	damn that's alright if they were one seed then they were good yeah it's p chill and fun
Yea they were good we did rlly good at doubles Doesn’t matter anymore it’s da past Das good I didn’t go for HMMT this yr What classes u takin	when was hmmt btw
There’s feb and November Feb is the harder one	i'm taking intro ML, algorithms, physics 2, embedded systems, and intro psych wasn't it like not safe to go this year
Uhh I’m p sure Michigan all stars went And like did rlly well Seems interesting Y not test out of physics 2	i probably should have but at the time i was worried about passing even one ASE so i just stuck with bio
I heard it’s annoying to take	it's alright physics is p chill so far
O	it's annoying but whatever i'm taking 5 classes this semester so it's like good padding
I feel like that’s a lot rite I see	yeah i didn't really want my whole semester to be classes what kind of college vibe are you
Wdym	like do u think you fit one college culture above the rest
Uhh not sure Idk I like a lot of things I wouldn’t rlly know the college culture of a school if I don’t go there	yeah i think that's p true
Ye	sad that all campus previews are basically fucked idk you uber well either so i wouldn't be able to say pton seems like a good fit but i also am not sure
Liek when I visited MIT I didn’t love it but like I don’t rlly think I got to see much of it in my day there Eh I think any place can be a good fit Just what u do there rlly	uhhh yeah it can be but u also want to be in the place that makes u happiest but also there have been times when i doubted myself so ig life is just a journey and u stick w whsat u choose make the most of it you'll be fine anywhere u go
Yea ik Moments like those I want to chose umich lol But I also know deep down I won’t choose umich	you know umich is actually super great the more i hear about it a lot of people underestimate it as a school but honestly it's p nice
It was Stanford and Princeton and I did Princeton early cuz Stanford deadline is earlier if u submit art portfolio for some reason	oh u submitted an art portfolio?
Yea	wait what art
Multimedia Paintings Drawings Sculptures Umich is gr8	oh wow did not know u were an artist that's so cool
Part of me wants a fresh start tho	i see what u mean
Lol I stopped in 10Th grade cuz I didn’t think twas cool But I do it again now Same w math rlly Ya like I have gr8 friends but also some things I wanna leave behind yakno	sure sure that makes sense
Would u like to see an a painting	wait art is so cool what are u saying yeah sure send me smth
I didn’t think that back then:( Cared too much abt what ppl thought	wow that's really good gotta let go man
Yeeee ik	i feel like everything matters so much in the moment and then u realize
Yea	eerything is going to shit anyways lmfao
Lol that’s depressing	but hey it's good vibes nowadays
But yea everything’s great in the long run Ye	aha yeah
Im getting published for a book tho I think that’s been the best thing abt Senior yr so far As in writing	OH WHAT you're publishing a book?
Hehe ya	wtf can i read it
Collection of short stories Much like the interpreter of the maladies except these r abt my life	who's your publisher
And the influence from specific ppl	hmm ok interesting
At umich! Got in touch w professor through my research mentor lol And he liked my writing ig	oh that's great yayyy
I kinda just started writing cuz it helped me cope kidle helped me make it good Ya kinda weird I went from math to this but the years been gr8	you seem to have a very turbulent mind you think too much
Many ppl say this Idk I don’t stay interested in one thjng for too long And I do think too much lol	if writing is a good form of release i'm all for it plus i totally agree it takes skill to be good at these art forms too lmao i wish i spent a little more time being thoughtful before but you know i'm doing alright rn so this is fine
Ehh all my art skill is just playing around w stuff in hope of creating nice things Yea I mean there’s always thjngs u can go back n do differently	eh just live your best life lol ok i'm gonna go sleep now
Yea	but
Oke gn	please also sleep at some point yeah gn :D
I shall Ttyl Dude I’m so bored It’s insane	i agree i am also bored out of my mind
Like what in the name of hell is one supposed to do the whole day I don’t even have school atleast u have that The weather is also shitty now	eh it's alright i'm not back in school for another 10 days yeah it's actually not bad imo
So u just sit in ur bedroom self isolating I guess I want like hot fries	I'm used to it What Lmao
How r u used to it I ordered hot fries	I can find ways to amuse myself What e those
They’re rlly good chips That u need to have while watching stuff I’m starting a tv show	which one
The good doctor	ohhh i've heard of that u know the american series is based off the korean series with the same name right
I didn’t know that I just started	i've watched clips on fb before seems good
It is Rlly good Watch it	lol i'm watching good will hunting rn
Oo big MIT janitor genius w PTSD from trauma n abuse Matt Damon is a gr8 actor	I'm not opening this text because I don't know what's wills problem yet
Oh ok sry Text after u finish	haha i didn't see the second part of your text so it was all good it was really good
Good good Indeed Love that movie There’s one line I love where professor lambo says there aren’t many ppl who know the difference between you and me I’m one of them It’s kind of eye opening	oh huh why is that your favorite quote
Idk if it’s my favorite Just a scene which stuck in my head	oh well why did it stick with you
How ig knowledge is equalizing It brought a fields medalist to his knees	well isn't knowledge actually nonequalizing
And that knowing ppl smarter than u exist accepting it is a whole different thing I see ur point	ah you're talking about being humbled
Indeed	you know what i think it's true that knowing and seeing firsthand is like a totally different experience you ever just think like
Yea	i worked so hard just get to smth that took you like 10 minutes that's so crazy you know
Yea I do	like people actually just exist like that
Seen it before	every day man
Kinda demoralizing but u accept it	you know but that's the thing if you view it as demoralizing all the time it never becomes like a thing you can really embrace like accepting it is not exactly the same thing at best it's just a not bad thing
True	but like while it kind of always sucks i feel like it's just better if you focus more on playing your own cards ok facts tho i think this is super hard to do
Oh yes playing ur own cards are important	and i literally struggle with this like all the time
What is? Accepting?	just like doing your own thing surrounded by greatness lmao
It’s true But Sry accident ^	why are you still up btw i just finished the movie and was about to knock out
Don’t sleep this early	but then you texted me back and i was like tf
Kinda when my brain works	you know i read a study that says the reason our brains are so active after a sleepy period around 11 or 12 is because our brains are supposed to be using this time to heal and grow and shit and i'm out here fucking wasting my brain cells on psets it's like some circadian rhythm thing idrk
Biology	anyways i'm going to bed now
Kk gn	tmrw is saturday and i'm gonna make an attempt to make it fun and useful to my life
No tomm is Sunday Go for it	i meant today u know what i meant whatever gn
I know I was joking but gn again	Any news?
M&T Waitlisted at Harvard I didn’t apply anywhere else	Aye congratssss Still waiting on stanny right
Yup That’s all I have left	M&T or pton
I think I’m too excited abt Stanford Uh pton	Novis on the up boiii
Lmaoo me n Srihari	Sad there's no more campus preview Anybody else u know
And then Ashley got Johns Hopkins	Big bois Oh is she med school?
Rohan got u Chicago I have no idea she applied to like 23 schools	Wait which rohan
Deme Meganas sister	Ohhhhh never personally met but That's awesome uchic is nice
Yuh	Wait this is so nice Novi is doing well
Yea It’s gr8 Whatcha doing	Trying to make bubble tea
Wot da U know how?	i watched a youtube video it was really fun i fucked it up at first but the bubbles turned out really nice
Like was it edible? Hmm Like nice as in good looking or good tasting When kung fu tea closes so u make ur own	yes it was both it was better than the store bought hard tapioca shit u just boil the texture was even throughout
How does one fuck up and still create a good end product while cooking Noice noice How’d u make the milk	Talent Oh I had jasmine milk tea powder but U can also just steep tea and add milk and sugar
Ok this is too complex for me I’m sticking to just making brownies How does one steep tea IM SO BORED	U just
I actually cook great breakfasts	Put the tea leaves in water
Oh wait my mom does this But it’s like hot	Bro That's just How u make tea
Okay but bubble tea isn’t hot Actually nvm I get it Neva mind	… I'm so Confused
Lmao when my incompetence leads to confusing u Wann see funny picture	Sure is this you this isn't that bad
Yes it is Me N ya ig it isn’t Do u prefer this	omg can i unsee this what is going on
Hehehehhe U asked for it	i mean not really but thanks?
Well u thought the last wasn’t funny	....meh i wsasn't necessarily
So I sent a funnier one	i don't think that thiis was equivalent of funny it was shocking
Ok it’s not that bad It’s not even me It’s just shrey with a few edits	dude who the hell is shrey
He’s my friend Plays bball My grade Ya idk it was one of the first things in ma camera roll	lol i don't know what's up but this too shall pass
Welp R u making more bubble tea today	i still have the stuff from yesterday but i have some dough leftover so if i decide not to get any more work done then yes i will
Do it Bubble tea is too good Wot work u have	school homework exam
I thought school hadn’t stated again	Starts on the 30th But I have work due then
O Wel Gud luck	Thanks
So i have p big conundrum now	did u get in
Mhm	OH SHIT CONGRATS well this is a good problem did anybody else get in
Nah Well pratham from Troy but u don’t know him Here thnx	oh hmm ok what do u feel rn what are you tryna study again
Uhh Financial engineering math Econ maybe cs Both r great I got 10k more money a year at pton	oh finaid?
Ya	pton has a lot of money yeah how many undergrads are there at stanford i forget
Idk	but orfie at pton makes bank idk if that exists at stanford math and econ are both good there too
I didn’t look that up	cs has jeff bezos but it's growing at pton
Yea ORFE is nice Math and Econ is better at pton Stanny has CS Ya per capita endowment kinda nice at pton	are they doing some sort of virtual campus preview
Ya	idk stanford is kind of hot these days for tech but like it's not like a default choice
It’s weird tho idk how these previews work Ya	unless you're dead set on like eecs or smth
Nah I’m not	pton breeds a lot of really refined people imo
Everyone does CS and lowkey kinda gets boring Wdym by refined	damn u did half of mit like that like really well spoken polished students
Okay but u guys can like quadruple Major I’m p sure ur fine	lmao am i gonna even do that
I see Don’t That’s academic suicide But ig u signed up for that when u got in If I could be well polished student	eh i like that i'm learning a lot
Or a startup guy	how uhhh like mentally tough do you think you are
P tough	hmm ok search up floating duck syndrome i heard it's like a thing at stanford
uhhh ok lemme look it up	also it's a pretty big party school too as far as i know
both schools r p good party schools like ton has eating clubs	lmao are you looking for that? some of them are fratty some of them are refined
idk what Stanford has but I down wanna be in a frat no lol I don't rlly care abt parties but im not opposed to go to them	ah ok hmm
oh I looked it up its like on the outside u pretend to be great but u r struggling deep down	yeah you know like how ducks look calm on the surface and under water they're paddling super hard idk if that's true though i don't have firsthand experience but it's a great time at either school lmao
yea I get it	haha i'm not being that helpful rn but ik a little bit about both schools so
I think ill be fine at either place like im sure ill struggle at times	yeah that's a fact of nature
but im p sure ill get through it one thing is ig stony has stronger sciences other than physics so maybe as a stem or math student I prob just be like tim but at ton I could be a lil better I dunno man im confused	eh if you're not fairly certain what you wanna study pton is more balanced i think
im not certain on cs no	they also basically throw money at their students
ya	so like anything you want to do you'll get a lot of support from faculty and admin
like I wanna go aboad okay ill pay for ur rent and food and yea professors rlly nice one of them offered to work w me on my current research	aw that's so cool
and some other stuff was kinda nice like I wasn't even committed	yeah they're nice
yea how r Harvard and MIT diff than ton n stanford	umm so i think harvard collects really active people who are looking to become like leaders or something and mit collects intellectuals a lot of great academics who will make really cool discoveries and entrepreneurship and business is p big at mit ig business is big at harvard too that's not to say there aren't leaders at mit or intellectuals at harvard tho it's like on average the population looks like this a lot of liberal arts colleges are trying to mobilize in more stem diretions these days tho i think harvard and pton are definitely taking steps in those directions
ohh so Harvard leader MiT intellectual	aha a very simplistic and narrow generalization but sure
how do they differ from Stanford and Ptom yea otherwise too many overlaps n confusion	uhhh so stanford has a pretty big startup culture silicon valley and shit pton is like wall street, law, public policy, and nonprofits
wb consulting	uhhh interesting idk anywhere else but mit has a lot of people interested in consulting harvard probably does too consulting is a money making industry
yea it is Makinzey is enticing I spelled that wromg	lmao yes u did mckinsey*
ik i literally saw myself spelling It wrong but ya I wanna work there for a bit	oh hmm
ya R u good at web design	Not really lol Front-end isn't really my thinf
Ok nvm then	I know HTML and css But that's about it
Hm ok Wb UI n graphics	Like actual design? Meh I don't have an eye for it
Know anyone who does? That I would know?	Uhhhhhh Perhaps Linda But I'm also Not sure
Weng? Wang*?	Wenf Weng Yeah
Fuck I corrected myself to the wrong spelling I see Fuck I don’t know her	Lol Ok Idk then
Wanna play tennis	lol i'm still not allowed to see anybody i would but i haven't even left my sub in a few months
Ur kidding Ur still not allowed to leave?	nope i have to be more careful than most people tho cuz my grandma's home
I’m taking web lab What about u?	Oh wait so is Ben do u know him I'm doing an exfernship Wait we should hang out sometime Also Do u have any interest in being a mentor for a high school hackathon? HackMIT runs something every Feb for high schoolers to come and learn some interesting stuff In cs And we need mentors for the front-end workshop And you're taking web.lab rn So that's perfect Alex Chen will be leading the workshop
Maybe is it a big time commitment? Idk Ben	It's a one day thing on Feb 8th for the learnathon Although wed love it if u could help out on the 9th too
Is there an application I need to fill out? Shoot I have a lion dance performance on the 8th at BU I could do the 9th tho	There's a Google form I'll send it to u See if there's an option for the 9th Oh bro you're in lion dance That's so cool
Yeet thanks	 Yeah so if you're back by afternoon or evening there's Saturday and there's also Sunday morning!b
Oh I think the trip is in the afternoon/evening so if I go I can only come Sunday :(	Oh lol that's totally fine we would appreciate any help we can get :)) Ask your friends in web.lab too!!! And lmk when you're free over the weekend
Ok I will	U live in MCC?
Yeah	Aight that's hella close
Hehe Where is ur externship?	Down memorial drive at the Microsoft nerd center
Big nerd brain	It's really not But also I realized I don't want to be a software engineer for the rest of my life
why not?	It's just like U sit there and code And I don't think I can do that 8 hours a day 5 days a week I gotta talk to more people yanno
oh sad watch hate coding later on too watch me*	Bro I don't know what to do w myself
maybe there are other coding jobs that are more collaborative also course 6 isn't limited to software engineers	Hope so At this point I'm just hoping to get into tech management early Ye Thank for the reality check
Haha no problem Sorry but I don’t think I’ll be able to do the hackathon. I kinda want the Sunday off and I also have no confidence in my skills sorry	Lol it's okay thanks for considering tho Come stop by and visit me tho :pp What lab section r u in for this class
6.08? I’m in section 2	Uhhh What time is that That's not the evening section right
12pm	Xp Sad I'm in 730pm bro when r u getting dinner today and is it at mcc
pay attention to class!!!	Lmaooooo I am!! emily i have a question about pset 3 for 6.042 so there was this question about a tournament diagraph which there exists like a full ranking and they asked us to prove that any tournament diagraph of size n has a full ranking and my question is just about the base case: should the base case be 1? bc i put 2 and got marked wrong but i figured that there couldn't be a ranking if there was just one player in a tournament right cuz they're not playing anybody? not sure
yeah I think we're looking for base case 1 because the ranking is still valid in that it's a length 0 path bc in the end the ranking was just a path that covered all the vertices, so it's still trivially valid in the n = 1 case even though it doesn't really make sense as a tournament	:ooooo fat L ok thanks emily
mhm!	:D emily do we need to know master theorem???? it's at the end of chapter 10 but i don't remember learning it all
Nope!	OK tyty EMILY ARE U BUSY I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT PSET 8 BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS QUESTION EVEN MEANS So like this last sentence says that the correctness of TA's and lecturer's responses are independent of each other but like does that mean u can assume P(T) and P(L) are independent because the T means that the TA says wrong and the L says that Lecturer says wrong i think i did part a mostly right except for expressing the independence of correctness and i want to use bayes theorem to find P(E | ~T ^ L)??? not sure if that's the right move
LMAO hello	YAYYYYYY hello
ok umm so T and L are like the yes/no responses which is different from correctness	oh so like depending on whether there's an error or not the yes/no could be different
umm yeah I think your bayes' rule idea is good because having weird expressions in a condition is annoying	wait so for the part a about writing conditional probabilities about the situation do i need to express that the correctness's are independent and for part b bayes theorem doesn't it mean that i still have to find P(~T ^ L) and P(~T ^ L | E)
yeah what do you have for a	so I have P[E] = 0.10, P[T | E] = 0.8, P[~T | ~E] = 0.8, P[E]P[L | E] + P[~E]P[~L | ~E] = 0.75
oh	basically i just found expressions for each of the probabilities that they gave is this incorrect lol
i think the lecturer one is phrased weirdly it should have the same meaning as the TA one	ohhhhh ok so like regardless of whether there is an error or not it's still .75 correct
because it's like no matter if the problem is right or not they'll be right with 75% accuracy yeah	omg i was so tripped up ok so it means the same thing as the TA thing
rip yeah i think the pset was worded weirdly yeah	big sad
ok does that help	yes i just have one last question though if i want to express the independence of the TA correctness and L correctness ok wait i think i kind of know
o ok yea you should write it out	given that the L is actually just like the T
you can use like definition of independence just make sure to express the concept of correctness correctly	hmmmmm ok
but i think you can intuit that either from like what the problem says or work backward from part b lmao	lol okay i'm going to try this
okiee good luck	thanksssssss
np!!	So 6 and 7 are my attempts at expressing independence Does this make any sort of sense
ya makes sense	yesssss thank u emily
mhm!	Omfg I just missed all my alarms this morning and just got up is there another recitation I can go to today to make it up OK I'm just gonna come now and see if I can sit in the 12pm recitation
"Lmao sorry just saw this
Ya it’s fine"	Lol thank u again haha hey emily are there office hours on sunday and monday for 6.042?
just sunday!	ok cool tyty wait now i'm confused do we have oh on monday?
Haha yeah OH 7-10 every day as usual Er Sunday-Wednesday	Ah okay thanksss
Oh wait sorry I read your first message as when will I be at OH lmao But ya OH as usual	Ohhhh okay haha yes I think I'm gonna be at OH today tho
Okie I will see you there!!	hey emily do u know if there will be birthday paradox or birthday principle on the midterm
hmm i think it's fair game	Noooooooo It's so hard tho hey emily why is the Pr[E] outside of the summation isn't x the event that we get a 6 and E the event that all previous rolls are even #'s
hmm so you can think of E as the general event that all previous rolls were event even* so it shouldn't depend on the value of k even though like the exact event is different for different values of k does that make sense the event itself is uncorrelated with k	uhhhhh is the general event that all previous rolls were even a summation too though? wait no
hmm	how can it be uncorrelated though if the k value changes the number of previous rolls
i think further down in the problem there's a hint about using P[X=k and E ]'s to get P[E] i think that's the most intuitive explanation for what E actually is	oh hmm
like, E is just the event that in general, all previous rolls were even regardless of what k is so if u think that E should depend on k how can u combine everything to get just P[E]	lmao wait i'm so confused hold on my brain gears are turning rn is P[E] like the summation of all the events of P[E] for different values of k?
Yee	ah ok i think i see i will try OK so I'm at this stage RN of the thing and i think that the probability of P[E] for any given k is (1/3)^k-1 so i don't see why we pull P[E] out when it should just cancel with the top (1/3)^k-1 but also is it weird that the probability of each k occurring is 1/6? but the sum goes to infinity oh no hold on P[E] should not be dependent on k right so that's why it gets pulled out? and we have to calculate that sum separately? ok wait is it 3/2
yeah it gets pulled out bc it's not dependent on k; if it were dependent you would just get 1 idr the exact answer how did u do it	ok so the probability you get even # rolls for every value of k is just 1/6 * (1/3)^k-1 u can find Pr[E] by summing that for alll possible values of k then u have k * 1/6 * (1/3)^k-1 which u also sum for k=1 through infinity then u take that sum and divide by the calculated value for P[E]
yea sounds about right	yesssss ok cool thanks emily
yep good job twas a hard problem	lmao why is this so hard smh
sorry i don't write psets :'(	big sad :((((
:(((	is there only one more pset after this
umm is this pset 9	yesmaam
yes theres a pset 10 and then an optional pset 11 i think pset 11 will be either exam review or fun math	"""fun math"""
hahhaha what can i say zach really likes math	wait when zach was doing the cards thing during lecture i was like yes i agree interesting but i cannot comprehend
LOOOL sorry :'(	Lmao we both thought of zach no it was alright
its ok for the final we're doing a TA run review session	i did much better on midterm 2 anyways but yayy
o yes congrats! i saw ur score made me proud :')	omg yaya :DDD
lmao i also watched u finish the exam like 20 min early and then sit there on ur phone	omg i feel like a good child living up to my TA's expectations ;'))
LOOL yes i am v proud :')))	emily on the last pset pset 8 there was a question about proving M and S to be independent and they were bernoulli variables and this is like the first part of my answer and i thought that it was ok to just prove that the events that the indicator variables represent are independent but then i got docked a lot of points cuz there's that lemma about indicator variables being independent if and only if their events are independent right and so i redefined events for the indicator variables but idk if it's right to use that lemma or if i used it in the right way but it's if and only if right so i thought it would be sorry for the ramble
hmm yeah you should be able to use the lemma graders don't see recitations so you can probably submit a regrade request and cite that recitation regrade requests are handled by TAs so it should be okay	ok cool i'll submit a request then! thanks so much emily
yep np!!	:DD also sorry emily one quick question last one if we're proving three way independence for 4 events, do we need to show that the 4 events are also not mutually independent
nah 4 events can be both 3 way independent and mutually independent or rather mutual independence implies 3 way independence but not necessarily the other way around	oh wait no there's like a pretty explicit bullet point that says we need to prove that they're not mutually though i totally missed that lol so i think we did have to do that meh that's ok i'll take the L on that one
ohh wait i think the problem itself asked to show that they weren't mutually but in general you don't have to	oops :ppp
LOL it's ok pnr :')	:pp agree are there office hours tmrw emily? big mistake missing lecture this week lmao
Yep	ok thanks :))
Mhm! Hihi you should tell your friends to be in my 042 rec 	i would absolutely love to but all my friends already took 6.042 last semester with meeee dw anybody i meet i will speak high praises of your rec

harvard's student council has a list yeet i found her why did i search her up	thanks so much do u think we could get an email it's for hackMIT we're looking for fire speakers
unfortunately we do not see the emails like we can send an email over but we don’t see them	aw rip is their email not in the alumni network list
The video chat ended. Happy birthdayyy	Ahh thank you erinnn yo what kinda matcha do u have at home

Good luck!!	Tyty
Hye! I realized I should've reach out earlier, but I've been swamped.  Are you still down to do a session of learning and practicing React?	hi gary yes definitely i have two midterms tmrw but then after that i'm chilling for a bit so anytime next week that works for u :)
Are you free on Monday at 4p? I should be pretty free starting Monday	yeeah monday at 4pm is good where do u want to meet
Let's meet in the stud?	sure! stud 5 today at 4pm for react still? allen will be joining i think
Yep! Yay! Okay, awesome, he's more than welcomed to join	:))
I'll be in techx lounge!	cool!
THANK YOU!!! hope the final went ok -- are you done now? and thank you for the story also!! the website is actually so good lol i have no idea how they put it together so quickly	yes i am free bro neither do i lol i was not expecting the elaborateness it's beuaitufl
YES also throwback to those days when we would stay at the med school way too late full on bushcampers	Legit bro those were actually the days
HAPPY BIRTHDAY JAMIE <3 WOOOOO hope your 19th is amazing	Ayeee thanks bb
Ooo also I have a friend who’s a rising senior in high school and interested in MIT Would you be willing to talk to her a bit about your experience etc? She’s interested in CS	Yeah for sure she can text me on fb or if she has a lot of stuff to ask email might be better jamiefu@mit.edu is my email
Yeah sure	Yay tyty I have an interview tn at 9 but probably need to be on the call for it a little earlier do u mind if I drop from the logs meeting like 15-20 min early
Yepp I’m actually planning on it being a shorter meeting Usually task reveal meeting gives people time to chat with their buddies but we can’t really do that over zoom	Oh yay thanks hannah just want to make sure i filled out the doodle correctly but we have a chat at 2pm edt tmrw right also what are we gonna be talking about
Hi!! Yes Just about life/hack concerns + some things to think about for your tasks Super chill	aight cool most of my meetings w my buddies are set up for thursday so i won't really have much to share on that end yet we'll be going through the materials together
Ok ya!! It’s not really to check up on progress lol it’s more of to get us started :))	oh gr* gr8 are we at go/logs-zoom i'll be on in like 7.5 min
Yepp Hihi Jamie!! What’s gonna be on the agenda for beginners meeting	hiii i haven't thought about it too deeply yet but it seemed like there a few things that haven't been decided regarding beginner workshops and how we approach this so i thought we'd have the people who are interested come together and decide
Ok I brought up to Anna + Savannah about having beginner workshops under hackweek And also Justin and I agreed that if beginner workshops were a thing then logs would basically figure out logistics of it and we’ll work with dev to get the content together I also don’t think I can join until perhaps a bit later :((	oh cool yeah sounds good i feel like if we go virtual beginner workshops will be less useful because the idea is that it's like we're helping in person but sure i'll see u whenever not sure how long the meeting will last
Hihi! I saw that u asked about the cost of buses So if u look in go/logs19, in the buses folder there’s a doc called bus options That’s what I researched last year? Might’ve changed? But generally greyhound has been the cheapest In the end, we paid like $1369ish?? For each one-way drive so like that multiplied by 4 Hope that helps! Hihi! Pls submit ur responses at go/game	oh hihi rip i can join the call but i can't really play i have like all of 036 to learn today lol i'll submit it anyways since these questions seem interesting
Ok yayyy that sounds good	hey hannah i scheduled a chat for 12pm on thursday do u have any time at 1130 or later like 3pm or smth my urop prof just scheduled a full lab meeting for that time lol
Lol ya just edit ur response Or like put in a new one and I’ll delete ur old one No stress	aight idk if i can edit but i'll put in a new one Lol I'm so sorry but can we reschedule our chat again jack just moved Penn apps talk to the time I rescheduled for
Lmfao ya no worries	Do u have time at like 430pm I can also just fill out the doodle poll again but I keep taking up spots without actually using them
Eastern time?	Heab Yeah
Yeah I can do that!	Oh whew ok Goodie
Lolll no worries I’ll talk to ya later :)) Hi is our chat now	wait what oh shit i meant thursday but i can hop on real quick now too upt o you
OH LOL oops ya can u do now pls	okie
Idt I can do Thursday at 4:30 Sorry ur original doodle poll was 4:30 my time So i didn’t think it was Thursday If that makes sense LOL	oh huh lol all good
Like I was like ya it’s not Thursday cuz that was her original time Ok Tyty	"hannah i put some stuff on go/nm under ""utilize the neurons heading"" that i wanted to talk about in heads sync we have dev/mkt meeting rn tho so when u have time before meeting today can u take a look and comment on anything that u may have answers too"
Cool beans Just looked	yeap i'm taking a look at your answers rn haha
Haha lit Also jw are we gonna make an official aanoincement about going virtual or nah	when does splash go live again like justin said it'll take like 2 weeks to make so like really 3 right might be best to just have it when splash goes live too because we'll have faqs on there too
Okiee Right Does Justin have a date lol	i think he's talking about it now in meeting
Also like are we gonna make a post about it?? Or are people just gonna infer from our website Okie cool I mean hopefully we shall be updated during general!!!	like on fb or medium? yeah lol we'll probably make an announcement on there or otherwise
Ya something like that?? Maybe something lokey? How are other hackathons doing it	looks like calhacks did a twitter and fb post we'll just pub it on social media and we can write a longer explanation on media medium rip we don't use that anymore
HAHA well Jessica did use it last year	i saw her post about autoadmitting
I feel like if there’s nothing that our faq doesn’t cover, we don’t need a huge medium post? Her post was really just cuz team freaked out about a bit of backlash we got but tbh I think we would’ve been fine either way But also up to u !!	wait we did? :oo alright yeah it could be nice to start using medium more it doesn't have to be a long write up i can probably write something up easily
LOL ya u can find stuff about it in slack or our drive Ya we used to do recap posts But jack did not write one haha ALSO Check these out	LOL holy lmkao why are u doing this to me ah rip
LOL I’m doing the work of the lord I couldn’t stop laughing Also check this idea out	LMAO toss it in go/virtual
LOL I WILL	mark it high priority
I will Also must do Jamie! Pls fill out the w2m	oops sorry just did it
Jamie!! Were y’all planning on having a judging meeting with dev	probably not all of dev but yeah at some point sean and i will bang out the judging form and email this weekend justin actually spent quite a bit of time talking about judging last dev meeting so i think it's on allen's radar now and he's working on allocating time slots
Ok great!	i think our approach is going to be first assign time slots
Um I had a meeting with Nadia yesteday and literally Sponsor judging WO W	lol whats up with that
We’re gonna have to talk about that AnywY! I brought this up cuz Nadia would like to be in the meeting y’all have with dev If u could just remember to loop her in that’d be great! HAHAHHAAH don’t even get me started	oh got it ok sean and i will just send out a w2m regarding it then ok lol i'll hold off
Also!! I was thinking yesterday and not sure if y’all already considered this, but we’re gonna have to probably switch up the panel of 5 judges each time, so it’s not like the same 5 judges are in one zoom call the whole 2 hours I mean we could talk about it like if u wanna hop on a call It’s a quick rant on my part anyway But It’s a rant	i was thikning it was going to be like each team has a room
With no answers rn???	and each judge has an assigned schedule
I like that!!!	lol ok im in a meeting rn but yeah sometime
Sure thing!! If u r ever curious just lmk loll but I might also talk about it in logs meeting Anywho That is all Gl with the work Y’all are doing gr8	oh ok yeah it'd be useful to get logs feedback haha thanks hannah not that meetings these days are particularly popping not like you specifically but in general i see less videos :(
HAHA O boi Ya Nadia literally started our call by going like How do u get new people to talk And I was like If OnLy I KnEw Anxjsjsjs	bro who knows haha it's hard to speak up in virtual calls and i feel that now that people think it's a norm some springfishies have been like yeah i think general is like not that useful
Yaaa :((((( O YIKES I mean lokey General b like that	but that's cuz like
It’s ez to feel that way	only 3 people talk so like your role becomes like a bystander
Hack struggles with this every year YES Like it’s come to the point where I will @ people I am like bruh u have an opinion I just wanna know	LOL call them out hannah
HAHA no I don’t try to  make it seem that way but hey U just gotta do what u gotta do I’m tired of hearing like My voice Kevin’s noice Voucw* Wow I messed that up Voice	yeah i think it could be useful when we do committee updates to have heads call on specific members to give the update at least that would make it a little better
Oo tru I feel like that’s harder for Cr	"oh yeah haha like ""oh yeah google's doing well"" ""no communication over here"""
“How’s cr doing” “haha well I’ve gotten better at handling rejection” Good meme	T.T
Hm what do u think would’ve helped u speak up besides time lol Like back when u were new	hmm idk i guess i got more comfortable first in committee meetings and then having some comradery with the fallfishies was good we should pay a springfishy every week to speak up and then other springfishies will also be convinced to speak up
LOL I’m too broke to pay anyone anything And Hack is theoretically broke too Ya I think people are mildly warming up during logs????? Well at least I make everyone speak LOL I hear their voices And I think Ah yes Progress	i hear their voices yeah rip money
Hm I feel like Fall fishies could also speak up more!	yeah for real
How do we do that I have never heard Allen Wang speak since coming back home u gotta Give him that push	LOL he speaks up in dev about gavel i also think he was one of the only people for which this time wasn't on his w2m for general tho i'll text him and convince him
awww wholesome friendship nadia wants to do some more LIT bonding stuff	Go/game Please around what time is judging set to be held this year sunday morning or like saturday evening
Hey! Great question Probably Sunday still Since it’s 36 hours Judging happens AFTER the 36 hours	like so it'll probably go from what like 9,10pm friday to 9,10am sunday shall we just say judging starts around 10am then
Hm we should probs discuss during schedule meeting! Tn But ya realistically probs around that time I’m p sure that’s the htn schedule	ok cool wait what needs to be done on connectivity and education
Wait lol nothing I think	oh
Julia and Anna got to it After I went to sleep	oh cuz i saw it and i was like
Ya can u look over pls! Fix wording Make it seem more	yeah sure
Like 1 person wrote it Maybe 1.5 people And not	lol alright
Literally 5 LOL HAHA Tysm 	yeah np did we confirm judging will start at 10am
Nope !! I think we’re actually having a lil buffer time after hacking ends To assign time slots and for west coast people	oh hmm ok i'll adjust on the google form can i tentatively say 11 or 12pm
Ya I think tentatively 11 am is p good!!	ok cool is 3 hours enough wait r u coming tn
Omg I’m so sorry yes I got caught up with another slack message	haha no worries are mentors allowed to be undergrads
No :(( idts	ok just making sure i don't know any non undergrads anymore LOL or i never knew any
What the actual fuck is this	LOL what is this
The judging folder from last year Have u looked at it	lol yeah but i didn't looko too far down the responses
LOL these were at the beginning Judgey mcjudgeface Got to me	oh what ok i must have not looked then i thought i did lol ik
Hm looks like 100ish sponsor judges Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh So much uncertainty	Oh that's better than I expected
Haha we had a lot more sponsors thoo	yeah rip
hi loll im radin over meeting notes for judging and wot does fairnes corerction mean	Heyyy It means that the rankings might bring in some non accuracy since it's relative so we'll just consider more projects in panel judging
Ooh ok What’s the plan rn for panel judging? Like how many panelists + how long + how many projects How long I think is what I care most about rn for schedule purposes	oh hmm so i know that the number of projects will be around 10 possibly 15 as for how long i don't think they discussed that does an hour sound fine to you
Who are y’all planning to have on the panel Ya hour is perfect if we do like 2 hours of expo haha	Isn't it usually speakers and some sponsor S
Ya but speakers aren’t a guarantee :((( Because normally they fly in Or they’re from the Boston area But Idt jack and Claire have specified like Hey y’all also need to be available At this time On Sunday	i think then we'll do higher level sponsors and if speakers can panel judging i can't imagine anybody else that would be legit for panel judging
Do u think we should extend sponsor judging into the panel judging time Giving them 3 hours instead of 2	i don't think they'd want to judge for that long i think it's ok to keep it shorter better*
Ya true If this is the case	if we get any profs from judging/mentor outreach that might be good for panel judging
Can u pls make sure jack & Claire communicate with the speakers	yeah wait splash went up but we didn't announce that hack is virtual yet Hi is Michael weird rn or is that just me
who's micahel which miaehcl lu?	Uh Yeah
:((( he seemed ok to me when we messaged 2 days ago? what's up tho	Lol OK two days ago is a while I just I'm just A little confused
Bruh tf What is this manz doing	Yeah same
Should I message him	Idk lol I just remembered U texted him a lot So I was like Aight better check
LOL I don’t text him a lot but ya we were next door neighbors	What I thought he was from new york Oh u mean At school
Yes!! He went to the same hs as my roommate too Ahh I messaged now we shall wait and see	Oh small world Lol OK cool
Wait He said 2 messages One was normal One was not	LOL All I've gotten is weird today
OK the third one was weird But weird in a Michael way So it’s normal LOL	LOL Standards We love to see it
Dude he’s normal Idk what the frk he’s saying to u	Dude what is happening I'm getting played
LOL I’m so confused I just read it again and Still confused	Dude same
What a hilarious dude Literal legend Wait I found this today While I was deleting files	LOL wht bars complete bars
hi! just wanted to reach out to see if you have any other thoughts on budget. i know that you want some sort of apparel (which u should 200% put in the doc!) but i wanted to know ur overall thoughts about it. at the end of the day, team votes on swag every year anyway 	Yeah I talked to jack a bit about it Overall I'm OK either way whatever team votes for I'm willing to support I agree that we should try to keep the cost a little lower in planning for swag
ok. i also know that budget was something that you and jack worked on, and that i brought it up for discussion during logs meeting without explicitly consulting you or jack first, and i was wondering how you felt about that?	Oh haha it's all good I hadn't really thought about the prize part of the discretionary funds so it was nice to see others give input Perhaps we could have modified it if we had known a little earlier tho since jack probably knows about mini events and prizes
called you. called you. Hello I'm at mit	Oh shig where
Bruh I left already Anjalie told me u guys were all in meetings	Yeah Sorry I was doing hack shit
Ur good	Aw shucks
Anjalie said she's coming next weekend	Hopefully we'll catch each other next time

I’m not really sure, I’ll let you know	OK thanks jack
ok do you have the walkie talkie with you? hey sorry ik you’re in class but we’re gonna get fined if they’re not returned do you have it with you or is it in your dorm?	I have it with me
are you able to get out of lecture quickly to return it? the AV office is 4-038	If I get there at 11 is it okay it's my CI-H so the class is very small idk if I can leave immediately He usually let's us out a little early
that’s okay I think if you can go immediately after class	Okay yeah I will
awesome thank you!	yeah so sorry for the trouble
np thanks for returning it!	Returned
great ty! hi Jamie! I'm organizing a free dinner at Matrix Partners with Stan Reiss for MIT students who are up to cool stuff -- would you be interested in coming? it's this Tuesday 10/8 at 6pm, also Stan was one of our speakers this year :)	Hi jack thanks so much for the offer! I don't think I'll be able to next week tho :// plz lmk about anything else upcoming tho!
okay np! hi! are you on your way to our 1 on 1?	what time should i sign up w for treehacks
uhh might as well fill out the application now? we can register as a team once everybody’s done that	team sorry* i am currently typing rn lol yea ok thankss hey jack i won't be at general on monday -- i went home a little early for thanksgiving break so i won't be back on campus until the 30th anything i should do before then?
heh sorry about the late reply general was canceled anyway	Yeah I saw the email It's no problem thanks jack do u still need a web mentor or smth For blueprint Cuz I texted Alex Chen to see if he knew anybody that might be interested So he said he'll check And also he might be interested too Idk if that works or not
ooh that would be super lit, ty for reaching out! we would love to have him, lmk if he can find anyone else too	aye ok cool yeah he's on club tennis so i just thought i'd give it a shot u want somebody to teach a workshop right
yay yeah we need a teacher for frontend web dev and backend web dev	ayeee ok i'll let u know how long would he need to be there for or how long is a workshop
they run from 10-11:30, 1-3:15, and 4-5 it would be ideal if he could be there for all of them but if he needs to hand off to someone else that's ok also we give him/anyone else who's teaching free lunch and bp swag :^)	oh i forgot to respond to this lol but i forwarded it along to alex and he said he was tentatively interested also where can i find the sso key for the newly deployed quill jason said i should look on aws but idrk what that means
uhhhh I would ask rinik wdym by sso key? I'm not sure why it would be on aws but jason is probably right lol	Its for spectacle and like using a user login on quill to sign in on spectaclr
yeah I’m not sure why it would be on AWS though	Oh huh Do u know where I might be able to find it
I would ask Rinik	OK I'll ask him
hey have we gotten any updates from Alex Chen? also just wanted to confirm that you're still planning to come on the ski trip :)	oh not yet i'll text him today uhhh wait when was it again
morning 2/1 - evening 2/2	okay alex said he's interested although he was surprised about the date so i'm checking to see if it still works when do u need a confirmation for ski trip by
no rush, just lmk when you know :)	ok thanks so much jack i'll get back to u soon :)) oh btw alex asked what in particular u guys want him to teach
we're looking for someone for frontend web dev and someone for backend web dev	yeah he said he's down from frontend stuff
he's also free to do it with friends if he knows anyone who he would want to teach with	and from what it sounds like he just wants to do one workshop
there are like four sessions throughout the day okay	oh hmm
like one of the 4 sessions? I mean that's fine we just need to find people for the other three	well if the workshop is the same for all 4 sessions maybe? like the content
oh yeah we just break them up a bit so like if he wanted to do the whole frontend track it's like one session, break for lunch, another session, break for a tech talk or something another two sessions I forgot what the exact schedule is but it's something like that	is it like html/css or more js things and react
probably html/css these students have basically never coded before	aight cool OH WAIT did u mean the 4 workshops are like all one big content broken up into smaller chunks
yes like all of the students will be the same they're all going to the same workshops within one track	gott it okay yes he's down
nice! did you ask if he wants to do it with anyone? it'll be about 60 high school students he'll have mentors to help him out we'll get them from techx/hack dev	checking rn
the way it works is he should have something prepared to show on the projector	it'll be just him tho
but he'll frequently pause to make sure everyone is caught up and if people get stuck they can use helpq and mentors will come assist	got it
wdym it'll be just him?	like i don't think anybody's going to teach the workshop w him
okay sounds good hey any word yet on whether or not you'll be coming to the ski trip?	Hey jack yeah Im going home that weekend actually so I won't be able to go on the trip :((
ok nw! thanks for letting me know	wait so jack we have a hack meeting today right it wasn't on the calendar but there was an email
my bad yes it’s now just got home	oh okay cool would it make sense to ask current web.lab students to mentor frontend at blueprint
definitely even if they can only come for a little bit of time	ok i only know like a few kids doing it but i can ask the m
cool ty	what is the backend track jack
Alex is doing frontend but backend they’re probably gonna do like intro to flask/apis/etc	Oh I see ok hey jack when do u think you can get your PR in for spectacle
uhh my current progress is committed to my branch actually if you just want to make the PR I’m not very close to done but I can’t work on it before like Monday/Tuesday night	oh ok fair i'll do that then
ok ty, sorry about that	yeah np
btw if you wanna come watch the caucuses we’re in Kye’s room	Aight thanks jack
actually nvm I just left lol seems like results are very delayed	Sad Ok is there dinner at think presentations tn
I don’t think so	sad
agreed	it's from 5-7 thooo big sad aight i'll eat before wait jack am i supposed to report to you if i can't go to part of today's presentations i have to meet with claire and justin and shirlyn for arduino at 6
yeah that’s fine dwai	but can't grab dinner until later today oh okay coolio hey jack will your stuff be in by dev meeting today
yeah I'll finish it up after class ends at 5 gonna be with justin from then until dev meeting starts and will finally have some time to work on it today further lol the last two days have been crazy	Sounds good yeah no worries
ok sorry I forgot I made dinner plans feel free to merge my branch for now and I’ll be at the GSD around 6 to finish it up	Lmao aight
should be jackcook/something I forgot what I called it but yeah I’ll have time to work on it tonight	ok yeah i merged whatever you had in your branch already but yeah lmk
ok coo l I'm at dev gsd now and gonna work on this for a bit sorry about not getting this stuff done sooner lol my calendar has been completely full from like friday night until now	Yeah np Thanks jack jack i'm not sure if you're done yet but the post requests now need to be made to /api/project/ instead of /api/project without the extra / and it shouldn't allow me to submit if i haven't inputted necessary vaues right
ok no worries and yeah I’m planning to do some basic form validation before submitting	Awesome cool When do mentors need to get there tmrq
I think vishruti is sending out an email to mentors soon, can you check with her hey what's the status on using spectacle tomorrow? is it almost ready? or should we be planning to use devpost?	i think we need to plan to use devpost but justin and i are going to work on spectacle during the day the frontend for join/create/invite team needs to get written but we weren't able to pass the token in properly yesterday for jwt
ok cool sounds good I'm not entirely done with submission but I can do that tomorrow too	oh awesome cool yeah the jwt thing isn't really working which is unfortunate i'm trying again rn
  	Sorry I'm late I accidentally went to building 2
haha no worries hey! I know it's only been a couple of days but have you thought more about running for director?	hi jack yeah i thought about it some more and i think like i'm 75 to 80% sure i want to run :))
amazing, I was chatting with claire and she mentioned to me that you were concerned about busywork/replying to travel reimbursement emails lol I actually had a meeting with hannah earlier today bc she's very likely going to be the next logs head, and we talked a lot about how to increase accountability on team this year we can chat about it more but yeah I wouldn't let that be a factor influencing whether or not you want to run but definitely let me know if you have any other questions! do you think you would be ready to do elections next monday?	Uh most likely yeah what do I need to prepare? Um I was a little concerned about that because I want to make sure I have time to dedicate to it Like fully
I think it'll be less busywork for you than it was for me, but that's definitely an important concern I found myself making more time for hack after I became director just bc I consider hack to be very important to me, but I was still able to do a bunch of other things I was still able to do 6 classes and a urop during the spring, it mostly picks up over the summer tbh like over the summer it was probably at least 10-15 hours a week after I got home from work/on weekends sometimes and that includes things like meetings, app reading, doing your own tasks (whether that's dev, logs, cr...), checking in with people, random stuff but honestly you can ask any previous director about this and I think they'll all tell you that it was worth it I had a great time planning hack 2019 and I'm super excited to start planning again for 2020	Oh I see Lmao damn jack Yeah it seems super rewarding and I think I'll give it a shot Wait so wdym by ready on Monday
amazing so I think we're going to have elections on March 2 if you could write up a brief one-page summary of your platform by the evening of feb 29 that would be awesome, it's nothing too intense mine had lots of bullet points/short sentences and then you should prepare a brief five-minute speech for march 2	ok got it thanks jack
sure thing, lmk if you have any questions!	:)) some kid from bp sent an email that got forwarded to spam had a couple questions about announcing winners + other things
mm yeah I saw that one, been following up on these things with various people on team but gonna try to finish those things up during general tomorrow	K cool
reminder to send me your platform :)	Hey jack sorry just got back I can get it to u by tonight
no worries that'd be great	
awesome! is this final or are you planning to make any more edits?	yeah it's basically final it's just like bullets so
cool I'm gonna send it out to team as soon as vishruti sends me hers	oh ok cool
and you're ready to give a five-minute speech on monday right? doesn't need to be exactly 5 haha but around that long	well not yet but i will be
looking forward to it :)	uh how formal does it have to be cuz i was just gonna be like chill and elaborate on my bullet points
entirely up to you I think it's good to explain your background, why you think you're a good fit, why you're running, etc and also talk through your points	oh ok yee will do thanks jack
yup good luck on monday :)	thank you haha
hey congrats!! I’m super hosed this week so let’s like formally chat about stuff this weekend or something are you free to pick up toscis with me like 7-8 on Thursday though?	Sounds good I'm more free this weekend too yeah I have lab from 730 to 10pm but maybe if we go a little earlier?
ok actually that’s a good idea because last year we picked it up just beforehand and it was frozen solid lol	Oh nice lmfao
let’s meet at stud at 6:30 on Thursday?	Down
lit see you then :) I know you don't drink but do you drink wine lmao no pressure at all	lmao sure i'll have a little
haha yay it's an old tradition	aha very interesting
hey are you busy right now?	Hey jack sorry my friends from Michigan came up today so I'm out in Cambridge rn
ah ok no worries	Do u want me to pick up the oath on my way back
no that's okay dw about it	OK lmk if u need anything
would you mind doing me a quick favor and checking if there's space in any of the freezers in maseeh to store three half-gallon ice cream containers lol for tomorrow	do u mean the basement fridges? yeah i can check
yeah those	ok i'll check when i get back
hmm could maybe fit one or two	The other one is full full
rip ok we'll make it work	But these two have some wiggle room
yeah looks like it	Omg my emojis changed amazing Now I can heart react and shit
ngl I think the heart eyes react is strictly better than the heart react	False I've been waiting for this heart react ever since everybody else got it
there are some bad opininos opinions*	Lmaooo No Never Not mine
can we actually meet stata at 6:45 we can walk over and then uber back with all the ice cream	Sure Wait lol do u know how long it'll take to get the ice cream Do u know if we can punt to like 7
uhh sure how important is it that you're back by 7:30?	Um like moderately I have lab at 730 but I can be like 15 minutes late probably
ok cool yeah 7 works then	OK haha tysm Hi I'm here
 In addition, since you’re applying for marketing, if you have a portfolio or any previous work that we can take a look at, please bring it on your laptop or send it to us before your interview! do you want to ask him if he can do 4?	Yep do we have to move sherry joseph said he's going to be 5-10 minutes late but that's like half the thing
hmm just replied to sherry that's fine if joseph is gonna be a little late not a big deal since he's near the end of the day	Aight
"can you reply to joseph heerens and michael lu with ""Sorry, there was a typo—your interview will actually be in room 26-204."" the scheduling office gave us a room that is not a classroom lmao"	yes done
 btw can you take the sorbet out of the freezer around like 12:30 and let it thaw a bit it won't take as long as it did on thursday, toscis has a special deep freezer and we just have a regular freezer and can you bring the sorbet + the cookies	Hannah thought we were doing the stuff in BC so she took it I'll ask her to thaw it Wait is it in BC
it's in building 2 that must have been why hannah was asking me earlier lol	Lol yeah I just woke up lmao
heh did you see my messages in the recruitment channel/do you have suggestions	For food? Uhhhhhh I really like mochi/rice cake But I'm mostly impartial
I can get some mochi are there some brands that are better than others	No clue
"Hello,

Thank you for taking the time to apply to HackMIT. We had a very competitive applicant pool this year, and unfortunately could not offer you a spot in HackMIT. We enjoyed getting to know you through our recruitment events, applications, and interviews, and really appreciated your enthusiasm.

If you're still interested in HackMIT, we highly recommend you apply next fall -- quite a few people who re-apply do get in later on. We wish you the best of luck with the rest of your semester!

Best,
Jack  also can you tell allen to pick a real snack lmao"	Yeah lmfao
ah fml my bad I forgot I have something 12-1:30 that I forgot to put on my calendar are you free for dinner tomorrow?	oh lmao have lab at 730 but basically if i can as long as i get back before then
sure, I'm down for like maseeh or something too if you want baker is better though	lmao how are either of those valid choices it works tho lmao
where would you eat	mcc hands down
imho baker > mcc	fine whatever u want
let's do this at 6 tomorrow	Ok
oh sorry I forgot to tell you sooner but you should come to techx md/ad elections 8pm-8pm 8pm-9pm* ahh I'm such a mess I usually am better about communicating these things lmao this week is weid weird*	Oh shit I totally forgot about those Is it okay if I go late bc I rescheduled a meeting to 8pm from 7pm BC of dev meeting And I made everybody else reschedule it oop ^^^^^^^^ can i text amy and tell her that i'll be late
sorry was getting dinner with a friend you can just show up a little late it’s chill I’ll try to get them to do Bryan first so you can hear the speeches	how late is late also are we doing assassins tn
yeah	is like 830 ok
we can send out matches after meeting I'd just try to get there as soon as you can	ok great
I'll try to delay as much as possible	yeah i'll try to speedo Omw
ok you missed speeches but it's ok heh	Sad Still coming tho
yeah I saw it’s ok	Do we have to go soon
I think we're fine to start sending out assignments right? and remind everyone that it doesn't start until midnight	Yeah I'll put kye in and then start sending them
sg also tell whoever has hillary to wait until like noon or something because he didn't get an eos oh nvm I had hillary I also reached out to hillary and filled him in on today who is the last person on my list assigned to should be the first person on your list	Sorry I just took a shower I'll check
no worries	Give me t 5
have you sent out assignments already btw	nope i haven't sent any
ok good I'm making go/assassins for rules is your kerb jamiefu?	yep
can you look over go/assassins and make sure everything looks right	yep looks good
ok cool you should probably let everyone know to look at it	where is the assassin spreadsheet again i forget
our directors folder	smh u put it in spring recruitment is this considered hazing did you delete your sheets already lol
I did yeah lmao I saved it in notes	nice i'll do that too
ok cool so who is my last person assigned to	neha
great your last person is assigned to allen wang	great
I'm gonna start sending these out	ok me too tell the person who has hillary to wait a bit
yeah your target is mindy	nice your target is soomin
	wait fuck it's not soomin it's kye you have kye
ok did you clarify with everyone to email us if they get someone out	nope oops can they just text us
the part about contesting is fair I think should we have them make a group chat?	what part about contesting all of us ?
like if you get someone out but the person who was gotten out disagrees on a rule or something we'll wait to resolve that before assigning the new target	oh we shouldn't say that
why not?	sorry i meant we shouldn't all know who got who out
oh actually that's right	should we?
yeah you're right so we'll just say message us if there's a rule question	yeah but still email to say when out?
wait I meant create a 4-person group chat the two people who got each other out and you and me not with like everyone on hack	only if there's smth in question
I think it's fine to not let us know when people get out then we can just ask who's still alive at meetings or something	yeah they should just pass it on right i already sent them all out should i text them all and be like text us if you have contested
yeah	ok
also lmao sorry I have to move our meeting again how about wednesday dinner something came up for tomorrow was originally going to tour an apartment tomorrow afternoon but the guy had to move it to like 6pm	smh jack i have stuff starting from 530 to 9pm wed wed lunch? thur lunch did u tell the person with hillary to chill
yes can't do wed but thursday lunch is fine	ok thursday lunch
clover at 12?	sure but i have to be at the Z by 110 for fencing
should be fine	can you send me the 1on1 questions
totally up to you what you want to ask but yeah here are a few suggestions I asked if anything about onboarding was confusing/if they had any questions this isn't as much of an issue this year as it was last year but I mentioned that people should feel comfortable talking to me about any issues with team, making sure everyone's voice is heard, etc I talked about burnout, asking people to be proactive if they're ever hosed/need to reassign work tried to show some humility and said I've never led a big team and asked for them to give me feedback whenever they had any to give and then I closed by asking if they had any goals or ideas for hack but yeah you should discuss/ask whatever you want to talk about with them totally your call	oh hmm i see ok i'll come up with a set of questions for friday but thank you for the suggestions
no worries also did you get my group snap also I just put the springfishies' birthdays into the hack calendar we should be good about doing things for people's birthdays this year I've been good so far with claire, savannah, and aliza I think nadia's is coming up we should do something during general next week hannah is very good at birthdays so she might bake something idk	No I didn't get a notif
weird I’ll try again tomorrow also I’m realizing do you think it’s a fair rule change to make bathrooms safe zones lmao like I want people to wash their hands	Uh Yeah let's do that
ok I’ll email out so everyone knows lol	Lop
oh wait actually it was already in go/assassins	Oh Yeah
I left it while I was editing the next house ones it's fine then everybody had the chance to read	Okie
wait also did you read the next 2E rules lmao they're hilarious the item to hold was a book and you were only safe if you were holding a book with more pages than the person tagging yo you*	Omfg That's so fucking funnt Dictionary Encyclopedia
yeah but like everyone's gonna get a dictionary or an encyclopedia	Tedtbook
you literally have to find the thiccest textbook there is	So then what do you do Lmao This is So intense
we should change the item next week to something funnier than lip balm	Agree Justin has many ideas Texted me about it
were there any good ones lmao	Didn't mention any specifically yet But I do want to do smth weird
oh boy lmao	What about a shoe A flip flop Boxers
hmmmmmm omg what if we did you know how we have the blueprint playing cards what if you had to hold the card that corresponds with the current hour	Wouldn't I just carry around the entire deck w me then
yeah but you'd have to remember to switch the card every hour no way everyone is gonna remember	But If I have them all Does it have to be on top or somethinf What if I just hold the bo of cards
you can only hold one card at a time	In my hand Omg jack OK you're just making this intense now lmfao It's not weird enough tho
wait is that not a good one I agree not weird but hard	Hard is cool But won't get enough stares
hmmmmm let's think about it over the week	Ok am thinking
can you actually try making the snapchat group lol I've done it twice and it doesn't let me do it it keeps saying it failed	Wait making a group? Sure but there's a people limot Hou can't add more than certain number of peoppe Also Ill do this tmrw mornig I am gonna sleep now
the limit is 32 there are less than that on team sounds good	do we continue hack activities i have 1on1s but
lol I have no idea	idk if i should should i cancel 1on1s for now because i for one have to find storage and i bet all the other fishies do too
yeah I mean that's very fair lol	this is sad
you should probably just cancel yeah	wb retreat
definitely canceled lol nobody will be here	yeah lmao so sad
	Ehe
do you still wanna do lunch today and if so let's do somewhere other than clover lol	Hmm maybe I just went to get brunch w some friends and I also broke some stuff on my board so I have to go into 6.08 to get it fixed I can do smth later if u want
heh okay it’s also not urgent like 2 days ago I thought we'd be chatting about normal director things but now like what's going on lmfao at some point we should chat about the club penguin idea I have been strongly advocating for this LMAO	What the
ok think about it if hackmit inevitably has to go virtual and we made an online world where you could walk around and do parts of the hackathon we would immediately become the littest virtual hackathon in the world	Lol yes But Are there any virtual hackathons that exist
I mean if the coronavirus persists then every hackathon will be virtual this fall or there won't be any at all and they'll all suck bc they'll just be done over slack + devpost	Yeah That sucks
so this is our opportunity to shine	Agree we should talk about this have we done spring rolls and fall rolls before
yeah lol that was 2015 I think	big sad we're running out of ideas
yeah lmao also we should probably do a general meeting on monday	oh facts uhhhh are we still going to proceed as normal or do we actually have to consider making a virtual hack
lol we need to discuss for sure let's get input from everyone I'm sure other people on team are thinking about this too	Yeah OK good idea
hey so I think we're gonna do heads sync right before general meeting at 8:30 do you have time to write meeting notes with me at like 8	I think I have a meeting at 8pm but I can write them beforehand and then you can take a look at 8?
uh sure	well actually i'm confused about everything on this agenda so like do u have any other earlier time that works for you?
wdym? sure how about 7:30?	like so do we have a 20-21 techx budget yet
nope	doesn't that run into dev meeting? if we're having one oh we're probably not
oh is dev meeting tonight? yeah I don't thikn so think*	uhhhh ok yeah justin didn't say anything so yeah 730 works
cool sounds good	ok my thing just got moved to 11pm if 8pm still works for u do u wanna do that instead
sure 8 sounds good	ok great haha sorry for the moving back and forth lol
yeah nw ok sorry I was taking care of something are you free now?	yep
I'm on go/hangouts omg ty for telling me about the drawful 2 promo lmao that was you right I just played with my high school friends over zoom it's so fun loool	YESSSSSSSSS i'm so excited i want to play this soon i love drawful
we are definitely doing some hack drawful games	i was on a zoom call yesterday the quality is p good
yeah ig we can try it for next week and see what we like are you planning to write meeting notes for today? Ethan never replied to me but tbh I think the only sensible decision is to start working toward our fall hackathon and a potential virtual one in parallel the most likely case is that our fall hackathon will get cancelled and then we won't need to start planning for a spring one (assuming we postpone) until like october so it makes sense to use this time to start planning and building a virtual hackathon imo	yeah i can write them today so that ideally we can hold the virtual one in the fall right what kind of separate planning does a virtual hackathon in the fall entail
I think that's open to discussion at a bare minimum we have devpost + slack I think the next level up, and the one that makes the most sense, is creating some sort of platform I was actually playing club penguin with my friend the other day LMAO and I think it would be fantastic I think at one more level up, we could do things like shipping swag to people, maybe other ideas? I remember Hannah suggested like reimbursing uber eats for people to replace food or something I think there's lots of potential	hmm ok yeah but would shipping swag to people be like a level up from the platform because that will be like a really big job i think but like yeah we can start from the bottom
it can't be more than putting together an in-person event lol	and see how each committee would be affected task wise right
let's aim high yeah and I think that like at the end of the day if the coronavirus somehow dies and we are able to hold an event this fall there's almost definitely an opportunity to fuse the virtual and physical events for people who we couldn't admit to the physical event or something so I don't think any work would go to waste	should we just say that this is the plan for now
let's chat in heads sync about it and see what everyone thinks and present the plan during meeting, with an opportunity to let anyone voice concerns but for now I would write meeting notes as if this is the plan and we need to discuss details yeah	ok yeah the meeting notes are about done i think
ok cool	all these retreat psas make me sad
sad on the bright side I got a full refund on the retreat airbnb so we don't have to deal with that nightmare	oh niceee yeah airbnb said it was like covering eveyrthing right
yeah thankfully idk how we'd get that reimbursed otherwise lol ok anyway I’m gonna cook dinner, will look at the notes in a bit	ok cool have fun are we using zoom let me in jack f
f btw I wanted to ask I know I've been leading meetings for the most part, how do you feel about that? would you like to lead more of them? do you think it's good that I'm leading them for now? do you want to switch off?	wowow a lot of questions i'm ok either way lol um maybe we can switch off and/or choose which topics each of us will discuss when we make the nm notes
sure that sounds good some topics definitely make more sense for me to discuss having organized tracks and admissions for example	yeah lol i don't understand spring yeah
but I think it'd be good for you to jump in and get practice here and there	yeah sure ofc i think we can do this yeah
sounds good bro did you get this email from leah this is like big news lmao	wait what email i haven't seen it i'm going to try and set a recurring meeting id for zoom meetings so we don't have to reset the go link every single time i made it as a recurring meeting so it's not supposed to expire for a year hopefully that works out
lol ok nice and hmm wait I might have forgotten to add you to techx-exec sorry but yeah Leah is leaving SAO she is like our worst enemy within MIT admin lmao this is great news just added you anyway so you'll get future techx-exec emails	LMAO okay great how much data validation did u do on the submit more and what else could be done to make it better for justin's starter tasks
I don't really remember but I doubt there was a ton of data validation, that'd be a good starter task adding new fields might be a good starter task too, I forgot what fields are there now I'm down to pair with someone too to get them up to speed	ok sure i can take a look to see which ones justin might want to assign
have you started writing meeting notes for tonight? I think following our meeting with hannah we should probably try to wrap up tracks	not yet i was gonna do it at 7
heads sync	be on in two
were you on the email earlier today from Lauren Tyger about the mit innovation initiative?	oh yeah was that directed to techx
must have been, yeah we do it every year	btw are we affiliated at all with the virtual midway techx devops is doing
we'll participate in the midway yeah	i got it as a bcc email to all student groups i think but yeah what should we do yeah
I think more details about that will come later	we're not helping them build it tho right
nope	ok lol
I can reply to Lauren in a bit wait also don't you have a midterm lol	uhhhhh so funny story everybody hit f5 at the same time and the site crashed
lmfao what	so they spent half an hour trying to get it back up but now it's just take home and it's still not open yet
wow	we did joe dirty
wow this is such a pro tip	i'm p sure they're changing it up a bit but i managed to a pull a copy from postman before they closed it so extra practice
lmao	too bad 006 on gradescope didn't crash
true I remember that day overleaf went down the night a big 172 pset was due and they pushed it back two days such a blessing I think these sites need to go down more often tbh why do they hire such good engineers	LOL did u read that post a while back of these elementary school kids getting an app removed from the playstore that was supposed to assign them hw
yes hahaha	that was like this but f5
btw can you write an email to send out to team + alums about the zoom party on saturday you're definitely better at writing social things than me lmao maybe include a list of example games that people are gonna play t y p e r a c e r send to all@hackmit.org, cc campus-alumni@hackmit.org and ask people to fill out go/rsvp	Yeee Will do by tn
cool ty I forgot the 009 quiz is 7:30-9:30 tomorrow lol are you free after 9:30?	Oh sad Uh I have an interview at 11pm maybe Taiwan
can we do 9:30?	Yeah that can woek i will sign the email with both of our names you will like it wait it can be as memey as i want right
yeah lmao up to you	ok amazing
I'm scared	don't be it's mild ok sent
lmao wow are you on ec-party?	lol no what's that
this email gives me ec-party vibes it's where they send the emails announcing the ec parties lmao	oh really lol i just have a lot of fun doing this
so do they	i'm not too big on movement tho
also it's skribbl.io not scribbl.io	so zoom parties are nice noooooop
lmao	i always mess something up lol
and now I can move to your empty room	it's the aesthetic
with the click of a new zoom background	ommg please please no
why is your wall so bare	wait it's not even my room i work in the dining room
wait same lmao	lol
wait you have an office chair in your dining room ???	i can't like work in my room bc then i just get distrcated by everything in there LOL YEAH we have two of them
what the	after i went to college my parents moved two office chairs into the dining room and that's where they do work sometimes and so i literally can't even work in my room because i have a folding chair at my desk in my room now
lmao also we should talk at some point about how we want to structure this party I'm thinking we should start by getting everyone in the same call and having everyone intro themselves since I think there will be a lot of older alums and then we can split into breakout rooms depending on the games people want to play? and switch breakout rooms every 30 mins or so	oh good idea do u know how breakout rooms work i do not
nope but we can learn	lol aight how to remove somebody from a mailing list somebody from campus alums asked to be removed
who asked?	Zareen
chowdhury?	I think? Their email is just zareenc
sad	@gmail And their last name doesn't showup
have you used moira before?	Yeah but I wasn't sure which one I should edit since the time doesn't quite match
the time?  and  I just removed her	ok great i'll let her know then
ah were you not able to come to cr today?	yeah sorry i think i might've told u but not nadia or the other way around but i have a project proposal meeting for 6.08 that was the only time that worked for my teammates
ahh okay no worries yeah at some point you should get familiar with our CRM definitely come to the call workshops next week	ok yeah i'll take a look at meeting notes
do you want to lead the cpw meeting?	sure the agenda today is just brainstorming an event to submit for cpw right do we have meeting notes for this did u submit our cpw event yet
I actually have not would you be down to take care of that?	yeah i can write a small blurb for it like it just needs to be really small blurb right
yeah like one paragraph you're replying to the ASA thing right	the online form yet yeah
nice do you also want to reply to the innovation initiative with it? I'd just say we're down for all three of the things they suggested and ask them to promote our event and pass on the name/blurb tysm	oh there's an asa form and the ii one i just started the ii one do we have a pr folder
wait there's an ii form? we don't	do we have a formal description of hackmit
wait did you get the email from the ASA?	that i should be using yeah
you should be on the list	so asa has an online form and so does ii
ah okay I didn't know ii had a form	and what are the 3 things about asa
let me find the usual cpw description hold on	cuz they just have like fill out the form
no 3 things from the ii in the email she mentioned 3 things we could do with them I thought they all sounded nice I just forwarded our usual CPW event to you	oh it's just a bunch of forms i'll just do them all lmao
awesome thanks again lmk if you need help with anything	what's the title of our event yee i'll text u if there's smth i'm not sure oh f what time are we doing slideshow karaoke and on what day
uhhh let's keep our existing time	can we poll hack really quickly oh like
unless we want to move it back I think friday the 17th is good let's do like 9pm edt?	sure wdym by existing time tho
our cpw event was originally supposed to be the 17th at like 5pm or something but yeah let's do 9pm to accommodate west coast too	oh i see ok the asa form only has techx listed as the org is it ok to just put the event under that
yeah oh and yes to the zoom thing	should i just put our two kerbs down for now
yeah sounds good	wait jack the engage form is asking me to register our org as a whole for the midway but i technically can't do that for techx right it's not event specific
ah for midway hmm I wouldn't worry about it TechX is making the thing anyway, I'm sure they'll take care of us	it's saying only reg per org should be submitted at the top so i can leave the midway form
yeah	ok should we ask amy or whomever to add our kerbs to the discord server request that's also one submission per org
uhh yeah why not it's tiffany now	ok i'll text her
tiffany huang	ye can i just call it slideshow karaoke with hack
I would specify HackMIT but yeah	oki HackMIT is MIT's largest hackathon, held annually every fall for undergraduates around the world. For 24 hours, over 1,000 hackers gather on campus to experiment and innovate on cool software and hardware projects! Our 30-member organizing team is a close-knit group of undergraduates who put on HackMIT and Blueprint, a high school hackathon in the spring. We'd love to get to know you better over a few fun slideshow karaoke rounds -- join us for some interesting times and good vibes! my event description
nice maybe include a brief description of slideshow karaoke? and yeah this dropdown gets me every time lol it comes up a lot and there's no option that really fits I think I usually pick student life	f ok i'm gonna pick entrepreneurship, maker and campus life for the tags?
ye sounds good	ok ok we should be set i submitted to both ii and cpw
nice tysm for taking care of that	yeah np i'll let u know when tiffany responds about the other thing Should we send a reminder about zoom
yes can you actually lead most of the party tonight lol I just did the craziest hike of my life I am crippled I’ll be on zoom but like at like 20% energy lol	LMAO uh what if i have to leave early what do u want me to lead idk any of the games we were supposed to play at retreat
idk I’ll make Hannah do it I think at the beginning just get everyone to introduce themselves	ok
and then idk make a list of games and divide people into breakout rooms depending on what they want to play and then switch the breakout rooms every 30 mins or so I can help a bit I’m just like	alright
dead	lol alright
I lowkey thought I was going to die on that mountain at one point lmfao	damn yall really went for it nice
how are you all doing we're back in the main room	Oh really They must still be playing I had to leave Kevin has it under control did u pick times for the tracks and beginner meetings yet Jackkkk
sorry today has been weird I’ve spent my entire day killing ants gotten basically nothing done lol	Oh What I was about to ask if u were ok
I’ll kill 4 and then look up and there’s 5 more	Clearly u are But the ants are not
they all came in like overnight lol	Eek
yeah	That sounds Horrifying actually
I have not picked times but feel free to pick some yeah it’s awful I work in the living room too bc I share a room with Rinik and he doesn’t wake up until 6pm	Lol what How
and they’re all around there/dining room/kitchen it’s been awful I usually wake up at the time he goes to sleep lol	I'll do a w2m for interested people then Oh god Thags so bad
yeah lmao	My parents would have a seizire They're already like Bro What is wrong w u And I wake up at like 11 What else do we need to talk about at general today lmao should i reply all to the zoom party invite i sent with the go/feud link as postmortem i sent it in the social channel but that's not been uber popping
I wouldn’t spam alums tbh	Lol alright Fair enough
why tf did they call the CPW discord bot I'm so confused	LOL THEY DID? nice omfg there are like 2 other dorms doing slideshow karaoke the same day we're doing it and one of them is next ffffff
you’re joking	no wtfff they all called it powerpoint karaoke
smh	ffffs
it's fine hopefully some people come to ours definitely a bummer though	yeah our title has an exclamation mark if that helps i think cpw* pulled through tho like the website looks nice and everything and there are a lot of events
yeah that's great 29 people have RSVP'd to our event so far lol 	oh littt what's the status of midway for us i told tiffany to add you to the discord so i'm not up to date with what techx is plannign on doing
ok cool I think techx is probably planning to go as one group since it seems like they're going based on what's in engage so you and I can show up for techx for midway and that'll work out	aight cool 
hi	Can u hop on the call like 5 min before I just realized I have to go pee
yeah will do do you wanna give a brief rundown of what hack is after claire	yeah
and then make 3 breakout rooms with 2 team members each cool can you send me the presentations you found	all in the channel social those are the three i found
yeah found them ty	do u have the zoom link for midway it's not updated on the website either
it’s on midway.techx.io search for TechX	wait ik but it just says check back soon
really?  click the zoom button password is dwX7T82RfG	oh the link only went live at 1pm
oh this is such a meme lmao	wait literally lmao i'm gonna make cookies lol
do it	lmkfao gonna try and finish this 036 section have u written up the things for admissions and what was the other one
no but I am going to after dinner other one?	idk u said u were gonna write up two things one of them was admissions i'll leave meeting notes to u then, i just put in the stuff from last week and our meetings
hmm okay I’ll try to remember	yeah lol maybe there wasn't anything and i'm just tripping
I don’t think we have anything to sync about today, is anything coming to mind for you?	not really do u have anything to add to th meeting notes
nothing other than admissions stuff	alright cool
wait am I crazy lol what are your thoughts on a travel-optional round	wait i think the thing about accepting boston applicants when we run out of travel reimbursement money is true
what thing?	because like we should try to accept people if their applications are strong so like if we have a travel reimbursement round then we can potentially accept people from farther away who need travel reimbursement who have stronger applications
but	i'm not sure exactly what the nuances behind how this affects our diversity pool is
but that's important if we accept people from boston, they're on average going to be more economically diverse and we're constrained by our resources if we accept people from california, the only people who can come are the people who can afford to travel anybody who has a great application but no money is barred from coming to HackMIT and I don't think we should be putting anyone in that position	right but then they'd probably apply in the travel reimbursement round then we don't have to say at any point we should just take all of our boston applicants
what if someone forgets, or learns about HackMIT two weeks after we open applications? after two weeks of applications, the only people who can apply to HackMIT are the ones who can afford to come on their own that doesn't seem right to me	i feel like people who know about hackmit and need travel reimbursement will hear about it and apply by the right deadline because i think the time constraint is just there so we can decide the pool on which to spend our money on
I strongly disagree -- just talked about this with Nadia in order to make sure people are aware of the fact that the first round is reimbursement guaranteed, we'd need to tell everyone that and the people who can afford to pay for their own travel are not going to turn down a $200 check they're still going to apply in the first round so the people who apply in round 2 are the people who forgot about round 1 that group might lean slightly toward people who are economically advantaged but I would argue that it won't lean that way much at all I'm speaking about this as someone who probably could afford to travel to HackMIT from California on my own dime	so you're saying the only people who will apply in round 2 are people who forget about round 1 and are also economically advantaged
I would definitely apply in round 1 yes, and the people who forgot about round 1 and are economically disadvantaged will not apply or will email us asking for money	do u mean round 1 disadvantaged
I mean people who put off the app because they don't need reimbursement I think that group is tiny negligible I can't imagine anyone would turn down $200 to apply 2 weeks earlier	personally though i think if i need a reimbursement there would be more urgency for me to submit my application earlier and then the group from round 1 would have a larger amount of people who need travel reimbursement and then we can accept based on strongness of application
yes, but that same sense of urgency exists for people who can afford it I wouldn't procrastinate on something if it would cost me $200 I don't think anyone would regardless of your economic background	but the thing is if the way we're accepting applicants just based off the strongness of your application then we are still accepting the right people but just making sure that those who need travel reimbursement are identified beforehand
this ignores my core argument	are u saying we should favor applicants who are more economically disadvantaged
no I'm saying we should be impartial people who are more or less economically advantaged should have the same chances of coming to HackMIT	but just because everybody who applies in round 2 is more economically advantaged doesn't mean we favor them if we maintain the same standard for applications
but what I'm saying is there are people who won't apply in round 2 because they can't afford it it doesn't matter if we're holding them to the same standard if some people were out from the beginning	ok so then i feel like your argument is that we shouldn't penalize people who need travel reimbursement but forget to apply by round 1
yes or find out about hackmit after round 1 ends not necessarily forget for example: what do we do if we get an email after round 1 ends somebody just learned about hackmit, really wants to come, but can't come without a reimbursement what do we do? we got this exact email last year and we had to turn them away I was upset	i see your point but this doesn't help us if in the end we run out of money and have to accept all boston applicants becuase then we favor boston applicants (even if there is a more diverse set of economic backgrounds with this, we disadvantage late applicants who are economically disadvantaged from farhter locations)
right but favoring boston applicants is a function of our event's constraints it's not a function of our applicants' economic backgrounds	but then it makes it harder for those from farhter away to get into hack regardless of academic background economic*
do you think that's worse than making it harder for people of lower incomes? I think it's better as I said it's impossible to have a perfect admissions system, but I would prioritize racial and economic diversity above almost anything else personally	what if we reserve some internal amount of money for travel reimbursements for round 2 applicants who reach out about it i think that if we have a round 1 travel reimbursement round it will in fact skew towards people who actually need it and then we meet most needs and accept strong applications impartially
wait but there are people who won't apply but won't reach out either not everyone is going to email us asking for money -- some people will sit with the fact that they can't afford it	idk if someone wants to come would it be really that much harder for them to send an email or fill out a small separate form
how do we know that? I don't think that's fair at all to set aside money for people who will email us I don't see why this is true -- again, people who can afford it will still want a $200 reimbursement	i think the way i think about it is that it seems non transparent to accept worse boston applicants over better applicants from farther away. so those who need travel reimbursement from farhter away won't realize that sending in application later means that they're strongly disadvantaged. if i needed travel reimbursement i feel like i would want to know that submitting my applicationi earlier or submitting in a certain pool would give me higher chances of actually getting reimbursed
wait no this is false we admitted roughly equal proportions of out-of-state people in each round people who applied from outside of boston weren't put at a disadvantage if they applied later	but we just held them to higher standards since they were out of state?
I expended a roughly equal proportion of our travel reimbursement budget in each round, it basically reflected the applicant proportions in each round yes, but it has nothing to do with which round you apply in it does kind of come down to that one fundamental question: would you prefer to admit the student who can afford their travel with a better application from california, or the student with a worse application from boston I think we should be impartial to our applicants' financial situations, and would argue that we should admit the boston student because admitting the california student biases our hacker pool toward people who are economically advantaged	that's true but we also cannot confirm the economic status of the boston student
exactly on average, our boston students will be economically average but admitting the california student confirms that we're giving an edge to the economically advantaged	i mean if we just do normal round we cannot be confirmed the economic status of the california student either
right, but we're not giving an advantage to the student with more money because in this scenario, the california student with a good app but no money was discouraged and didn't apply if we have a normal round with travel reimbursement, the california student with more money and the california student with no money will both apply and then we'll admit the student with the better application regardless of economic background	i think the question at this point is reducing the barrier to getting travel reimbursement in a second round (in the situation that we just leave normal rounds vs we reserve some amount of money and ask them to email us) worth the disadvantage to most out of state students and i think i see your point but this is how we should make the conversation more clear when we continue to discuss this as a team
yeah we need to write this up and present the points clearly because this is actually a surprisingly complicated issue lol	eek yeah
cool well I'm glad we're on the same page lol even if we ultimately disagree I think it's important for everyone to understand the two sides	yeah i think everybody was confused today
yeah I agree like I'm fine losing this (or any) argument because more people disagree with me than agree with me but I will be annoyed if I feel like the people who disagree with me don't understand my argument	yeah i get you
kind of my fault for not communicating it clearly but this is also just a very complex issue lots of moving parts	u never know tho maybe if we redefine the question it will become more clear
hmm maybe I think I also explained parts of this clearly in a convo I had with Hannah I'll try to consolidate my thoughts and also write up the opposing perspective lmao I've always wanted to take 11.002 tbh this makes me want to take it more	What is that lol
making public policy	Oh lmao nice
I mean this is literally making public policy lol	I gotta try for negotiation again next semester f U should take it tho
yeah I also wanna take negotiation	Wait the survey they send out is totally not a survey I got played it's actually an application
over zoom though? 🤔🤔 lmao	Yeah rip the 11.011 kids this semester
next semester too tho most likely	Fffff this actually sucks Making history should not be like this
I was talking to people the other day this is actually gonna really fuck things up for like years to come like imagine fall semester goes virtual a significant portion of students, not just at MIT but all over the world, will take a gap year and stay home but then there will be the same number of students next year as there are this year, because people will return from their gap years and almost nobody would graduate next year meaning that colleges won't be able to admit a full class of 2025 because there's just no space in dorms/no teaching resources colleges would probably have to admit fewer students and also admit some students on the condition that they take a gap year first to spread them out	wait you're actually thinking the same thing that my friend just texted me about like a week ago she said liek the exact same thing
lol it's so fucked like college admissions is just gonna be insanely difficult next year I don't see how there's any other way	rip class of 25 unless mit figures out way to just handle a massive class of 25 and a smaller class of 24 because like in total the same number of students would still be here
I mean the only way to do that is	it would just be imbalance
what if they kept BC open for like 2-3 years to handle the influx of students who come back from their gap years they'd temporarily be able to sustain an increased number of students because new vassar will be done	i mean wouldn't the total number of undergrads be the same tho
no, it would increase because if everyone takes a gap year next year then the following year, nobody will have graduated and then the number of upperclassmen will increase by like 1000 because nobody's graduating but we're still accepting new students	oh alright i see yeah hmm
not that BC can house an extra thousand people but it'd take 300 students and then maybe MIT can force more doubles/triples	does mit have a strict policy against gap years
and admit some students under the condition that they take a gap year first	or that but that just like propogates back
I think you can do one or two before you come to MIT well yes but it would spread out the students	yeah ig
like rather than admitting a lot fewer next year, they could admit a little fewer over the next three years but yeah you can do one or two years before you come to MIT and then you can do up to two years in the middle of your MIT education]	oh ok i actually didn't know that
it's actually more strict than some other schools Harvard lets you take as many gap semesters as you want as long as the total stays under 10 years	10 is a lot
MIT only lets you take one gap period and it has to be two years or less yeah lmao I think that's why all the harvard students say like 202x	lmao
a lot of them take semesters off and it's pretty chill	i didn't even know that was a thing
lmao if you look up some harvard students on twitter all of their bios say like harvard 202x	i mean i feel like you wouldn't want to take off that many semesters right
lol who knows	wild
maybe someone has 10 different startup ideas a new one each year	lol after it fails come back and try again next semester
lmao though this is making me think of someone I met at CPW who deferred his admission for two years imagine getting admitted in 2018 and starting to attend MIT this fall	i can't lol i need to expereience this with the homies i feel weird being much older than people around me is that a me thing
lmao someday that'll be your everyday existence but yeah he did like a 2-year religious retreat or something	Idk if I could ever commit myself to something for that long at that age
yeah	have u seen thomas's email
yeah I'll respond in a bit, just took a midterm how about 10:30am tomorrow? are you free?	how was the midterm
pretty hard lmao I hope I did okay	i have OH at 11am but if half an hour works i can
I don't want it to be longer than 30 mins lol so let's do that kind of off-topic but we should reach out to the innovation initiative for blueprint mentors next year I'm really not impressed by tom lol what a waste of time	oh i just saw this i'm not really sure what he was trying to get out of the meeting
like he just didn't prepare at all for the meeting I don't understand either lol	it's nice to have him tho
I guess, just be wary of contacts of MIT trying to lend a hand though contacts from* MIT	haha ok
we try our best to remain independent/not be in a position where MIT could cut us off if they don't like us	why lol oh i see
speakers too could get dicey what if they work hard to get a contact for us and we decide we don't want them to speak at our event lol	oh oof lol
sponsor contacts maybe though	is there a particular reason he wants our input or he just looking for student input in general
probably just generally looking for student input I was a little worried he was gonna ask us to put on an online hackathon over the summer lol a lot of groups will ask you to do this, you should not feel bad saying no there have been at least five student groups over the last year that have asked me directly to help them or partner with hackmit to organize a hackathon for their cause if the innovation initiative asked us to do that, that'd put us in a tough spot though harder to say no to them	oh lmao oof yeah
one of our prizes NEEDS to be 2020 vision for the best CV hack and the prize can be like a pair of binoculars or a cheap telescope	LOL omg what's cv
computer vision	oh we have a prize like that? or you're syaing like we should make one
no no I'm saying we should make one for this year lmao I'm just telling you so at least one of us can remember when we talk about prizes	it shouldn't just be comp vision tho like what if somebody actually has a hack that helps u see better but yes i agree
lmao ok so any vision themed hack ah fml I completely lost track of time lmk how the beginners meeting goes	yeah we just finished notes on go/beg-nm lmk what some of your thoughts are bc we talked about booking someplace in the stud for beginners + beginner prize among other things
oh that's interesting	also a beginner workshop day of if virtual tho we can probably move some of it to hackweek
nice	also hacknow had steve wozniak as a speaker
oh wow that's crazy	yeah lol vishruti was just talking about it it is quite
I bet we'll have an easier time getting someone big if we go virtual calhacks always has an easier time getting speakers bc it's like a 1hr commute from silicon valley nobody wants to fly to boston lol	oh yeahhhh yeah i think so to too*
I gotta follow up on drew houston but I'm 99% sure we can get qasar younis this year at a minimum last year he expressed strong interest in speaking this year	oh nicee Anything to add to the meeting notes ?
I'm finishing something up, was gonna look in like 10 mins so we seem to be getting a bunch of requests from other hackathons for info lol are you down to hop on these calls like next week probably 15-30 mins each so far HackTX, Hack the North, and HackGT have reached out to us, I think it would be worth our time to reach out to PennApps and MHacks as well, I know their directors we're not gonna get any useful info from HackTX lol but we can be nice to them	OK sure What do they want to know about
everyone just wants info tbh I personally don't think we should go around telling everyone about our club penguin idea lol we've tried cross-hackathon collaborations in the past and they never work out we should definitely open-source it and write something up about it after HackMIT takes place though	lol because u think they might try to contribute ?
yeah they'll want to partner on it with us I'm curious what htn wants to know though since they've committed to postponing their event	yeah who knows
although technically I'm not supposed to know that lol I think we should try to get as many non-club penguin ideas as possible from these other hackathons though e.g. if they've thought about slack, judging, things like that what times are you free for short meetings next week?	p free tuesdya during the day and all day friday if we could get them back to back that would be nice
I have a feeling we won't but I'll try	:p ok whatever works
"btw tomorrow during heads sync I think we should discuss making a decision on virtualizing I personally think you and I should push for committing to a virtual hackathon tbh people have been quarantined for 50+ days and new cases haven't even begun to decline, all of MIT's plans for this fall involve keeping some students off campus (which would make bringing 1000 people to johnson impossible), the most optimistic timeline for mass-producing a vaccine is like October-November, and two other major hackathons (HTN and HackGT) have already postponed or virtualized their events I think if we commit to virtualizing now we'll all have more time to think about how we can make the hackathon a lot better, like in logs and general we're always saying ""x depends on whether or not we're gonna go virtual"", and dev would also be able to get started on club penguin/gavel changes/things that are specific to holding a virtual hackathon/etc what do you think?"	hmm yeah this makes sense i think we should make a decision soon yeah
I think there's no reason not to decide tomorrow tbh	i don't think it'd make that much of a difference if we postpone right
wdym by that? can you stay on zoom for a sec oops	like i think virtual over postponing is better oh rip i'll hpo back on heads sync today right
yeah Justin and I are planning to chat quickly at 10 about dev plans for club penguin, will you be free to join in?	oh rip i was trying to figure something out for my urop and didn't see this
ah no worries	did i miss it
we're on go/zoom if you wanna join nah we'll be on until 11 angela and hannah are joining soon	oh alright i'll be on in a bit
cool sounds good go/hackgt btw ah you found it	when you started typing i figured lol
 that was actually pretty helpful tbh she had some good ideas this hacktx one is going to be strictly less helpful lol	she said a lot of things i didn't think of lol
but let's see what happens yeah same	also what information are we disseminating and not disseminating so like def not the club penguin thing
I think we should keep the club penguin thing to ourselves for now	but i was curious if there was anything else
don't think so yeah lol kind of what we expected	i think she just doesn't knkow what to do yet for a virtual format
yeah there are a lot of challenges that smaller hackathons face that big ones like us and gt and htn and etc don't even have to think about like at hackcon it became very apparent that a lot of these smaller 200-300 person hackathons face the same issues that are really difficult to solve	rip the department thing
yeah they all have issues with their schools/departments none of their teams are social I'm not sure why but they're all like this lol there was a very clear difference between how she's approaching it vs how claudia's approaching it too	are they sprouted off of their departments or are they like forced into affiliation
probably forced to affiliate with them some schools are really good about it, others not so much	wdym
like hack the north hugely benefits from their relationship with their school their school works very closely with them to give them basically anything they want lol and as a result they're able to run a really great 1000 person event every year, psets get voided or have big deadline extensions for their team members like claudia understands that we need to place a huge emphasis on making sure the hackathon experience doesn't suffer as a result of going virtual	oh wat
whereas victoria seemed more focused on just running the same event except in a different format yeah in the week or two before their hackathon they get special privileges from their school or something so they can devote a lot more time toward setting up the venue and stuff	i wonder if they have enough manpower to be considering making the virtual experience as good tho
right unfortunate but it is what it is lmao Patrick never replied to me the hack the north guy I hope we can chat with them soon if pennapps still thinks there's a chance they'll be a physical event this fall then idk what useful info we'll get from them maybe we should set something up with calhacks/mhacks sometime also do you wanna see my club penguin prototype	lol sure and sure
 wait WAIT it stopped working correctly f	what do u want me to do i saw you moving just now
do you see anything moving lol can you move?	but why are there two jacks what am i supposed to move with
click on the screen that's weird I'm supposed to control my dot not yours	lol are u sure i'm not controlling yours
ok well it was working this morning yeah	it's cool
lmao this is all that club penguin is right just add a background and penguin avatars and we've got it	lmao also i feel like also the link u sent me stopped working
yeah I turned it off	what was i gonna sya oh ok i forget now
lmao was it about our chats with the organizers	no it was about club penguin i think
about club penguin? heh	ohw hale
rpi rip* lol fixed it	amazing
can you take point on infosys? you can probably reply with a modified version of one of our templates bcc tiffany and cc sponsor	ok
btw I made a new budget for this year it's extremely simple lol lmk if you have any thoughts 	oh nice there might be a beginner and meme prize too
ah yeah	what should go on meeting notes today
I think we should keep it short today bc people are finishing up papers and studying for finals and stuff I think hannah wanted to discuss questions that should be in our faq this year because we haven't rewritten our faq in like 5 years lol but other than that I'm not sure	ok sg
we can maybe do some splash feedback depending on how much progress mkt has made?	do u wanna go over anything from our discussion from hackgt and hacktx that u think we should consider sure
oh true let's recap that stuff nothing from hacktx though	ok sure thing
when is your last final btw? pennapps wants to chat now they finally figured out that they will not be holding a physical 1000 person event this fall lol I'm thinking we can do sometime next week	lol my last final is wednesday thursday would be gr8
ok cool let's do thursday also scheduling a call with hack the north btw trying to get it back to back with the pennapps one	aye cool we said no general this week right
yeah	be on in a sec have to get out of my current meeting eek
lmao same	shat lol
wait LOL I just realized I completely forgot about mkt meeting yesterday oops how is splash looking? feel free to answer after this call lol	LOL yeah we did not see u angela wants it done by this weekend almost everything is done they haven't made decisions about tracks page yet tho hard decisions*
ok cool	she's gonna set up a time with justin soon to talk splash i think justin already has a w2m but we'll see
lol that was kinda useless because they have nothing planned out yet but they're always nice and friendly we should definitely reconnect later in the summer though let's see what pennapps is up to	ah to be canadian yeah
LOL awkward	no paid plan rip :')
:’) let’s write meeting notes at 7?	Sure I threw some stuff on there after logs yesterday but yeah Let's talk about what else we need to decode
ok great eating dinner atm but yeah let’s chat soon meeting notes look great btw, thanks for taking care of that this can probably be all we cover today	yeah np um so originally i wanted to talk about some of the stuff under neurons during heads sync since i'm not sure if some stuff has been resolved/wanted heads to make some decisions but we can just address those in the beginning so everybody knows too
ah okay yeah sure anything in particular that you wanted to make decisions about?	so like hannah talked about international outreach i wanted to know if she was gonna make that part of the outreach logs + ask nadia about CR non profit benefits
ah yeah logs always takes care of outreach for hack	yeah ok cuz if we start reaching out to nonprofits for mentors/judges cr might have to draft up some like pubbing opportunity benefits
yeah maybe let's defer that to heads sync next week? when we can all chat	sure yeah i texted hannah so i think she's taking a look onw
btw I think we're technically skipping the techx exec meeting right now but idrc	uh yeah i didn't fill out the w2m do we need to be there for that
lmao I noticed power move tbh I hate them honestly I still need to fill you in on the tea at some point	oh good idea LMAO i just saw that like u hadn't at the time so i was like oh i'll come back to it
hahahahaha I ended up filling it out but very late but like whatever lol nadia is mia are you free now for a DRW call?	my zoom meeting actually just got moved to 1pm so yeah i am
it's ok, we rescheduled	oh ok rip
rip do you think we should write a BLM post for the hack social media accounts?	Yeah I was going to talk to you about this today actually Can we match some amount in donations Are we able to
hmm I would like to but I don't know how we would do it I can ask Ethan	OK cool Yeah that would be good
just sent it cc'd you lol I almost wonder if we should ask team I bet you everyone will be on board except Kevin he's actually pretty republican lol, idk how much you've talked to him	LOL yes not that much about politics didn't want to really get into it with him
it came up a lot during the hack house bc nadia is very liberal and they talk a lot so sometimes it'd get heated lmao and also once over dinner he told me he voted for trump in 2016 and was going to vote for trump again if bernie won the primary and I was like ??? hello	yes lol oh.. uh yeah idk about that one
yeah lmao he’d be like “I’m a single issue voter and I just don’t think everyone should get free college so that’s why I don’t support Bernie” I think Nadia has since convinced him that being a “single issue voter” is stupid and bernie’s proposal isn’t just free college for everyone but idk where he stands on like donating to bail funds hopefully he will agree	oh that note we should decide where it's going to
yeah I actually thought about this a lot yesterday I ended up splitting a donation between four orgs I liked but I wonder what hack should contribute to yeah	hmm i see yeah i'm not reallly sure
might be nice not to pick just one? I feel like it’s more impactful to pick a few like Minnesota freedom fund went viral and now they have $20m that they don’t know what to do with	lol yeah like that's what i was thinking about
sent an attachment.	like what orgs would benefit the most
this was the one I ended up contributing the most to splits your contribution between a lot of different bail funds which is nice but I wonder if we should also do stem focused ones, like black girls code or something we’ve worked with black girls code for blueprint for the last several years so that might be nice? team might also have good thoughts here Black in AI has been going kinda viral in the AI community but it’s a bit removed from HackMIT	mhacks decided to split to black girls code too oh i didn't konw that yeah that's a nice tie
yeah they’ve been regulars at the orgs fair for awhile now	i'm actually not that well informed atm so i'll look into it more we should also ask team tho
I think we have other URM orgs too that come to the org fairs yeah this probably isn’t a decision we should make ourselves maybe we can mention something tonight at the meetings and also post in slack? could hold a brief meeting tonight after judging	do u mean UX
"yeah my bad cool I can post something brief then? ""@active and I have decided that we'd like to write a post for the HackMIT social media accounts in solidarity of the BLM movement and recent events -- we'd like to have HackMIT match some amount of donations to various causes, and we'd love to get everyone's input on this! If you're free please come to a 30-minute meeting tonight at 9pm ET, if you're not free please message one of us with your thoughts and we will make sure it gets discussed"""	yeah that looks good
cool	what do u think of campaign zero and ldf
I donated to campaign zero, they seem cool not familiar with idf	 LDF
ohh that one	yeah
yeah they seem cool oto too*	i looked through some stuff and decided like i liked these two the best
nice I'm curious to see what people will think later	yeah me too also did u see stanford's announcement yesterday
no	apparently theyre doing a quarter system where students will only be on for 2 of the quarters
oh no way	and they're starting early and doing final exams online
well they already do the quarter system right	
so that's not as big of a leap	oh i didn't know that lol
yeah they always have three semesters a year	oh yeah i remember now
they're 10 weeks each instead of our 2 15-week ones	oh yeah  there's a form we can fill out to try to get our donations stacked
interesting	Can I look at the statement
did you see the message in slack I was just about to message everyone from yesterday	should the word black be capitalized
I looked it up and I think so actually I edited it and it's a little different now but I think we should keep it see 	lol i maxed out my nyt subscription f not subscription articles
lmao	"also for the first sentence idk why but it feels weird to read like ""appalled at the systematic racism that is prevalent in our society today"" like just that part i think it feels like here that we are just realizing that there is systematic racism"
"hmm I'm not sure I agree 100%, but what if I remove ""today""?"	hmm yeah that might make it better
I think that's a fair cahnge change* sentence feels otherwise okay to me	yeah
what do you think of these edits to the last paragraph	yeah that's good i like it
nice highlight from the article if you're curious btw	oh thanks yeah i saw the first bit but not any farhter
also I think you can open in incognito mode/clear cookies to read more articles	yeah i tried icog and on explorer too idk why it didn't work
ah rip lol	should we come up with an email template to respond to those sending us receipts so they have a confirmation we've received their donation i can make it real quick tn
sure go for it I meant to ask you about that I made a spreadsheet to keep track of them btw go/donations	Ah nice Yeah I'll do it tn
are you gonna reply to the emails too?	Yes I replied mb for not ccing team I didn't want to clog up the inbox but I'll cc team
ah okay makes sense any thoughts about Katie's comments btw?	are they saying that we're spending too much on swag or like that everybody is on the same page
I honestly don't know	lol i'm just confused
maybe we can formally tell team about our budget during the next general meeting but I feel like there has been actually zero opposition to our plan with swag? someone isn't speaking up something similar happened last summer	oh shoot wait really uh yeah idk
I mean there's only so much we can do I think we should tell team about budget during the next general meeting and see if anyone speaks up if not there's nothing we can do	yeah that's good let's tell team about the budgeted plan for swag in particular too to be sure
right can you mute jianna lmao	LOL yeah i did
have you seen the confession	No which one
check hack confessions for the link	Oh yikea Yeah I see it now
yeah we got a lot of bad confessions last summer when we changed the admissions policy I think the play for now is to ignore it and in 2-3 weeks announce that we're donating the full $2k in retrospect matching may have been a mistake might have made more sense to donate it outright but I don't fault us for doing that	I mean by matching we hope to spread the word to the hackathon community to encourage them to donate
right, there’s a good argument on both sides	Idk the confession reads as ad hominem attacks so I don't think we should respond
sorry I am not a scholar what does ad hominem mean again :p I learned about this in like 11th grade	It just means like Personal attacks Rather than attacks on our positon /stance
yeah there are some people who we'll never be able to please	Right
cool I guess we'll see if the situation evolves last summer one confession turned into like 8 more lmao I don't see why this one would encourage more confessions but we'll see	Oh shit wow
yeah	Yeah
if you want to check out some recent hack history read through the now-archived #pr channel (public relations)	alright i'll take a look ok i gtg but let's monitor
yup can you do me a huge favor I wanna test playground real quick with logs and I only have one ngrok tunnel	ok what do u need me to do
download this fml it's not uploading clone  and then yarn and then yarn start but also in index.js change localhost:8080 to 0.tcp.ngrok.io:10955 actually instead of yarn start you might run into issues do yarn build cd dist python -m  and then ngrok the port it says in your terminal	wait
what's the issue?	oh i just need to install cross-env
okay	wait also am i still supposed to change localhost to the ngrok link
"uhh did you run just ""yarn""?"	yarn build
run yarn first then yarn build yarn installs everything	ok i'm building now fuck what does this mean
huh in index.js replace it with ./js/character.js maybe? aaaaaah why does my internet suck so much that I can't even upload my 2mb zip file	wait it's still saying serving on 8000
yeah and then ngrok http 8000 do you have ngrok installed?	no f LOL
are u installing it now I can help with meeting notes in a few mins, finishing up dinner atm have you started them yet? I’m not too sure what we need to discuss today but we can start by recapping some of the meetings we had last week	Yep I wrote them Was out on a bike ride
can you get the frontend repo up and running again lol I want to test my fix of the bug we found on sunday during mkt meeting actually jk I found another ngrok-like service that I can use instead	oh nice
lol this is like not at all what I meant by this task LOL but I love it	"LOL it's really ""club penguin"" now"
I meant like the UI part of the song selector but it is ok lmfao	oh
I don't have the heart to tell her that lmao	they're working so hard yeah haha
yeah we'll just keep it :p	:pp
can I get a breakout room with jianna looool I got your attention	omg yes should we share with the rest of team what's going on with that confessions post someone else made a confession regarding it in the channel
I just saw I think I'm just gonna reply to the confession what do you think? Drawing from past experience with this from last summer, it's unprofessional for us to reply or issue statements in response to anonymous posts on MIT confessions. If you're interested in talking about the contents of the confession, please reach out to me and/or directly	yeah i think so that's good
cool	i think getting involved in discourse like this will generate more controversy
yeah	ok cool
whoa Kevin gave me a +1 we never agree on like anything lmfao we got another response	ah i see it
I'm not too sure how to reply	i can't remember exactly the contents of the confession anymore but like
the thing is like we have discussed the diversity issue in the past, at least among leadership hard to know how to address this comment without knowing who's writing it	hmm yeah like maybe the part that they want to address is about whether these criticisms should induce us to make a change i suppose
the problem is like there's no solution we tried really hard to push for diversity last fall during your recruitment round	yeah but we can't force people to apply and like idk how we can change our image so that peopole want to apply if that's what was preventing them ahead of time
yeah	is this the main issue that they want us to address i can't tell
yeah I'm not too sure if I had to guess, that'd be it though let me think of what we can say yeah this is hard	let me think about this some more because the majority of the content of the confession imo is just an attack on us and our decisions that we've made regarding our post
right	ugh i'm confused
yeah I'm trying to write a response to this and it's getting longer	oof i'm in a meeting now but once i'm out of it i can help u address some points
okay oof hannah scooped me that's not really what I was going for	haha yeah i saw
lmao I guess this is fine	maybe it's just like between us two we made sense of the confession and decided on what we thought about it but other people don't konw what we're thinking so that's why they want to talk about it
yeah maybe it'd help to give a bit more context around this issue	yeah we need to sign up for 2 on 1s right
yeah we probably should let’s do a 2 on 2 though	ok do u have time tmrw
can we do Monday actually do they have a slot before heads sync?	there's only sat sun this weekend and sat sun next weekend
ah what times do they have tomorrow?	i think 7 to 8 ish edt
sorry I’m not at my laptop	all good
can we take the latest one? usually have dinner around then	we can do next week too 5:40pm pdt is the latest one oh wait that's 9pm ish
well it’ll be the same next week let’s take that	ok
also after last night I realized I need a nickname for you on messenger I have one for Hannah and Justin	what's justin i have so many fun variations of my name  see above
being John is at least as bad because you’ll inevitably go by and then for your entire life everyone you meet will ask you why is a nickname for John and then you just have to say I don’t know every single time right now Justin is an involuntary monk because his family is vegetarian and he was vegetarian through high school but in college he started regularly eating meat	omg i forgot you're john
and now he’s home again for a long time and he’s just not eating any meat LOL	oh damn wow i don't know very many asian families like that chinese*
yeah same set your nickname to boots and cata. set your nickname to boots and cats. best thing I could come up with right now	oh dear this is too similar to hannah i'll let u think about it a little longer i trust your creativity
no boots is Hannah’s old name two weeks ago she became pta mom instead	OK fair forgot logs is tmrw at 8 still want to do the meeting at 840? 2-on2*
oops is there a 7:40 option?	yeah i moved us there
cool	jack r u coming
omg yes sorry do you have a link?	 it's tiffany's room
kk coming I'm doing it	DO IT oh so it is on gh-pages right
yeah lmao	nice i await the update also now that splash is up should we announce somewhere that it'll be virtual or should we leave the hackers to muddle through that themselves lol
yeah we should post on fb/twitter/ig	ok
although actually do we need to post? idk we always post registration countdown like 4 days in advance of reg launch maybe that’s enough? idk if we posted last year when splash went live might be nice though	yeah hmm
it's up lmao	wow beautiful
how do you feel about swag?	i'm still in favor of doing face masks as a secondary item but i can understand that the shipping costs might get too high that's why i thought hats might be a good idea as a primary long sleeves could be interesting too i don't have very many of those
hmm yeah I think if we're optimizing for shipping weight and cost, we should do t-shirts the ones with nice fabric are like $4 each and they're pretty lightweight and I think they'd get probably more use than hats? probably get*	"it's possible but i agree with hannah that t shirts aren't very special like they'll probably have a lot of t shirts already so it'd get more use but it wouldn't be like the ""only one"" that they have"
I think that's a good reason to do a face mask	so like i kinda want to pick something more unique that they don't already have yeah like face masks
but I still think a shirt is a great safe option	even if it gets like less overall usage
alongside that	i have it on meeting notes so we can maybe discuss it together today as well
yeah oh you know what I saw one hackathon do that was kind of funny what's it called when the long sleeve shirt is like two colors	uh idk
I can't find it probably wouldn't make sense for our event lmao I'm not opposed to long sleeves though	do u mean something like that
I think it makes sense to have one thing that a lot of people will keep/use, and another thing that's a bit more unique/special	or smth weird
ohh yeah like that	oh ok
probably wouldn't make sense with our branding though I thought there was a word for those	there is? i never knew can ask angela tho
I could be wrong since I don't remember it haha	i'm going to be late i need to go pee
alright I have a feeling Nadia is gonna win this argument over branding quill, I'm starting to lose steam with this one but if we end up doing this, you should absolutely remember to take it down next year lol	wait what do u mean branding quill
did you see the photo in #social kevin and nadia literally want to do that	oh lol uhhhh lol
kevin fought hard for it last year and I kinda shut it down	does it even matter to sponsors
I can't believe he's doing it again no sponsors never even see quill	i don't think it matters that much but i guess they can put it on sponsordoc if they want
it's just kinda dumb and tacky	idk maybe we should solicit sponsor feedback on this and if they want it we can do it also should we get started
yeah go for it btw michelle sent me a message and let me know that things have been kinda rough at home and she may drop	I see T.T
but she needs more time to think about it	Hope she's doing alright
yeah	did u ever get to making the shared slack channels w pennapps + htn + was there sommebody else
pennapps doesn’t pay for slack so we can’t do it with them HTN’s director doesn’t reply to his texts lol	Oh rip lol sad
yeah lmao we’ll get the HTN one going as soon as they get back to us	just saw this on the hack page
r u gonna pset 042 today	kind of want to finish it yeah when do u want to do this
Eating lunch rn I'm free in like 20?	oh well i'm not even out of class yet i don't get out until 1230 but i can eat lunch around then and like does 1pm work
yeah 1s good	cool wait r u in maseeh rn

okie Ok im here	Hi friend R u upstairs

ok lol	jeffrey my friend do u have ideas
ideas for what	about what to do for my word parse r
oh oof I've just been watching YouTube	noooooooo i know this is past your active hours but if u spontaneously discover the answer to life in general or this problem please tell me
yes will do but don't expect too much	T.T JEFFREY I DID IT I'M A GOD
oh yay congrats what did u end up doing	ok so get this u can set like a paren number such that every open is +1 and every close is -1 i have a helper function called get_op that uses tokens[index+1:] and finds the op with the property that paren number is 0 which is the op for the left and right side thennnnn u can call the right side of the op with parse on the op's index +1 also u should be more excited for me
hmm I mean I mostly just asked outta politeness I don't actually understand anything u just said but yeah BIG BRAIN what r u gonna do now lol	well i'm going to comment my code but probably gonna chill for a bit maybe once it's like 11pm i'll start doing work again THANKS JEFFREY this is the validation i needed it's cool trust me
damn ok i think I might go to sleep lol	early night for you wow r u really that bored
i got really cold after walking in the rain so I just started watching YouTube in bed but now I'm really tired so I think im just gonna sleep	okay good night don't eat any frosted flakes

o	So I don't think I'll be that hungry At 9
oh ok	Maybe I'll still go to Baker to chill U never know THERE IS TRICK OR TREATING IB MASEEH AT 9 TODAY Which is probably my move rn But
wait is it like trick or treating through maseeh halls	If u guys want to come too U probably could Like the gras heads of house peer mentors There's like a list of rooms
hmm ok I'll think about it low-key can't get out of my bed rn	Can I have frozen mangos if I come over
lmao sure	Let me in
oh wow no warning uhh which entry	Idk the main one? How does MacGregor even with Work
omw I need help on problem 4 ;(	Sir I am not here What's your question I'll try to explain
uhh everything I don't understand it But gimme a sec I'll give u a more specific question Is part a just (1/2)^(5 choose 2 - 1)	yes
Is part b just that times 252	yes
yeeeeeeeeeeeeee for part c r u just saying that if there does not exist an edge coloring that contains no monochromatic, the expected value must be greater than equal to 1 but its less so contradiction	yeah why do u have to confirm your answers with me u know it
I'm just making sure	lol ok sir dude hasn't liziqi been posting so fucking much lately
omg did u see her new video I'm craving hot pot so much	YES SO GOOD ME TOO wait does hmart actually have kbbq
wait yeah it's raw but it's really easy to cook Thomas and I made it before we should cook it sometime	ok i'm down we could probably do it over thanksgiving
okie	i have a quiz review for 6.004 tmrw night forgot
oh sad ok wanna study Wednesday?	if i skip 6.009 office hours i can do 7-10 or between 3 and 5
damn ur so busy I have rec from 3 to 4 so 7-10 probably works better	:ppp ok this is dependent on how much of lab 8 i have done by then but i'll try
wait do u even plan on studying for 042	uhhhh i already read the textbook and took notes at some point i'm hoping to look through the recitation problems and midterm practice and i have to write my crib sheet wow i just made myself stressed lol nice

oh can't u do it for credit tho	i could but i don't think i'll attend that often and it doesn't actually give u credit for 6.006 so it'd just be elective ig
oh ok makes sense	wait is there a late fee for this because i just pre-reg fuck
for spring or iap	iap
cuz iap doesn't have a fee I think	oh good

wdym	what does 1-3 mean by describe a database
Ur basically designing a data structure with those methods	oh hmm ok what does splice mean
Like insert l2 after x	Like all of L2? U don't have to interweave them right Why do 2 through 4 just feel like random writing and explanation
if u just attach the head and tail everything else automatically fills in so it takes o(1) yeah I'm not really looking forward to this class	Yeah OK I think I get it wya were leaving
Just got my coat	OK were getting coats now missed your call. DPR LIVE's new album came out  thomas told me u just him yours i think we will have a very low score

jamie for 1b i think you have more cases to count for your numerator wait jamie is your answer	Yes
but and anjalie got 0.56 too wiat i am kind of confused now Hi I totally forgot to bring my key can u pls not leave or lock the door Thank you very very much	Yeah sure I'm not leaving Ml
Okay Great 	
jamiieeee is that right?	Start judging should activate web links Mass email should perform the emailing
what do you mean by activate web links?	Email should email the web links
that?? sorry wait so that one does the mass emailing	Yeah that's the function
but i dont see a function	But start judging is not the same thing as emailing
that activates web links	Or we don't want it to be
so like web links that the judges see?	Well I did it like the enable /disable button For activation
so like is that part of code basically like committing a new enabled session?	Sort of Do u understand the functionality of the other actions I'm going to pistol now but Yeah you need two actio s
i actually dont think i get it LOL	OK wait I recommend that u spend some more time going through the code base files So u understood how the changes u make to the HTML file interact with the backend Yeah but first try to understand the other actions
wait what are the code base files? do u mean like admin.py	code base just means the entire repository of code i think the useful ones are admin.py judge.py utils.py admin.html judge.html just to kind of understand how it all goes together like at the top of most of these python files there are several imports which are important to understand too like a lot of stuff in controllers, template filters, annotator.py in models
hi to prove that m&s are pairwise independent do we just prove that like P[M&S} = P[M]*P[S]	Yes But the events M and A S Not their indicatoes
Hi How can you just do that like separate it Can’t you only do that if they’re independent ??	yeah they are u literally defined that in the first part
wait no i defined that t given e and l given e are indepedent>... bc in part c we prove that they are dependent	you prove that they are dependent but their correctness is independent
yes	is claire there i think she has it on her paper
i am looking at her paper	oh yeah
and shes at dinner;(	yeah so you've proven that in any given branch (E or not E) the answers are independent but u don't know for both E and not E together whether they are independent and they're not
oh i see	yeah
hi jamie i have another quick question sorry why is it 2^(10 choose 2) i thought it would just be 2^10?	For the number of possible edges ? Theres two colors And 10 choose 2 edges
wait yes i am dumb	Lol You're not It's finee
jamie	Yes
is spectacle just like a project submission platform like devpost	Yeah At its core Don't forget about your 1on1
Yes Wait when have we ever sent him A mandatory revision ??	Thats just like the final submission
Lobby 10 Be there Or be square	Yesmaam

Wait for 4c What do I do after this two?? Step I feel like I’m summinh the wrong thing	I'm gonna be back in a bit
okay Im not back but like I just am so close but so far but just aiyo	Actually that looks right I just looked at it Now just solve
Wait but I can’t solve Lkke I have a 1/6	1/6 is half times a third Does that make sense now How did u get 1/4
I did like geometric sums ??	Same transformation Yeah
Like the first term is 1/6	They have a formula on the pset?
And divide by 1-1/3 Yes I didn’t use it tho	Oh
Bc i DIDNT ybderdtnad okay wait let me try it	Well transform it to fit the pset one
IH I GOT IT okay im Kush dumb hehe	Kush?
Just I **	oh
wait jamie fu omfg I forgot to say happy thanksgiving aiyo;( but would you be okay if Jackie or Elva slept in ur bed tonight? or if I slept in ur bed? if not it’s totally okay	lmao i got back this morning you'd have to ask claire or anjalie ig
ohhh omfg I thought u were coming back on Monday HAHAHA will see u in a bit then also hello spectacle maintainer	lmfao yeah sure where r u going to eat tonight yeah no idk anything

She said it was okay HAHAHA	Lolll U already read me that screenshot
Are u comih back to the room?	yes i am coming back soon do u want to get dinner rn
aiyo i already got dinner sad	Haha Issok
Okay hi Um I haven’t done 5b yet but got 5c Should I start with lkke a^2-1 is divisible by p so a^2-1 equivalent to 0 mod p Which is then equal to (a+1)(a-1) And then plug in 1 mod p for a? But like how do I multiply two modules like would (1modp)^2 be like (1mod p)??? or lkke 1 mod p^2	U should translate them all into divides So p|(a+1) P divides a - q 1s 1* Etc
And then plug in lkke 1 mod p and -1 mod p For a? So then like P| 1 mod p+1	If a = 1 mod p
Which is equal to 2 mod p	Translated to divides
Or is that not	It is p divides a -1 Either u do everything in mod or everything in terms of divides There's no plugging if u do divides
Wait I’ve been doing divides Oh I see Ok	Do y understand now
Yes I believe so	"Better if we just talk when u get back sudo installer -pkg /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Packages/macOS_SDK_headers_for_macOS_10.14.pkg -target / Not sure what's going wrong in your case but I pretty much think it has to do with the new command line tools. Did you run xcode-select --install after your update to Catalina?

Run that command if you haven't already and try to reinstall gcc. I had to install and reinstall gcc a couple of times brew uninstall gcc
brew uninstall gcc@7
brew uninstall gcc@9

brew install gcc@8   ^ just for reference catalina uses gcc 9 now which may be causing problems  read this"
"Okay ty wait so after i do xcode-select --install it says error: command line tools are already installed, use ""Software Update"" to install updates so like if i figure that out do i just uninstall after andthen brew install?"	"what is ""Software Update"" can u do gcc --version  i think u have to revert to a lower version yeaeh catalina sucks ass"

HAPPY NEW YEAR Yeah I should probably get to it right It's like the total sum Is what function in terms of n
But how am I supposed to get that??	Integral method I think?
ok I’ll try it when I get home ty wait jamie were you the one that said that like you cant take two ci-h's in one term like sorry not one term but like in one year? You cannot receive CI credit for more than one CI‑H subject per semester. bc it says that so i took a ciht his semester btu would it count if i took it nex semester?	No It wouldnt
Wait do u know where it says that Or	Well u said it right here Wait Oh U meant like Fall? Then yeah It would
What? Like sprint Spring If I took it	Uh That's the same year tho
But this says	Oh what
Semester	I thought this said per year I read somewhere anyways that evey year you're required to take a CI So
so	Youd have to take one next year anyways At some point
Wait no Ohhhh KSKDKSKS osos Let me Find that	Yeah I'm not sure I thought I saw t
I’ll ask the hassoffice	Lmk
And lyk	Ok Thanks Oh what Cool Did u ask if u have to take a cih every year tho
ya	She said no?
That was her answer ... So I’m assuming the answer is no?	well she said that u can get credit for both ci-hs which i think we already figured out but not if u had to take at least one ci every year how was work btw
hmmmm but i think like by receiving credit for both U don’t have to take one every year Bc u only need 2 Work was fun HAHAHAH we were judt Onbording The whole time It was like dev Dude it was fun	how many externs did he have lol

Ok so Im at the dentist rn but i looked at it and I think like my task is p doable bc I didn’t realize the methods were already written LOL so I’ll do it when I get back at around 10:30am?? Or 10 actually	Sure 
"The video chat ended. hi um question
for 
invite names list
or invte names
should it be a list
so you can input multiple names or should we just let it be one name so you input one at a time jesus called you. jesus called you. jesus called you. jesus called you."	jianna what PE and what time do u have available i want tuesday thursday 1pm which works for me milo and tai but we need to decide between fencing and archery
I think thag works for me i lkke archery hehe but The thing is then i would have to wake up At 5am I want tuesthurstoo btw	I think we may go for archery then haha Milo may join us r u going to do fencing at some point
um wait I rlly want to do dis w u But idk if I can wake up At 5 Gddm Maybe I should set an alarm or something  um honestly idk Fencing doesn’t seem that I teresintg I also might do hip hop dance fam idk	Ohhh I think imma do fencing this upcoming q But then u should wait for me to do archery sir
LOL	Then this q u don't have to wake up early And just sign up for hip hop
r u leaving tai	Haha idk tai and milo are both doing fencing status update is your PR updated jianna for spectacle the pr u made is it the most recent version
Um lemme check I believe so	ok thanks made some comments on your pr i think you need to fix
ok ty i will check it jamie i dont see ur comments??	Should be on the side of the files u made changes too They're not directly on the thread U have to check the file commits/chnges
do you mean that?? it seems like youve already committed it? wait f im done dumb ok let me try to find it that was ur own commit owieuri	Yeah Uhhh It's in changed files On your pr
that?? i dont see any commments fammm ok anyways im coming back tonight ill just ask u then	Yes but not this file Oh I'm home this weekend  ^this is where u should be looking ^jianna any updates for me?
yes i was trying to figure out how my vscode worked so i could open a python file i didn't but there aren't comments there either?? owiueroiwur like ik this isn't the whole screen but there aren't any comments	Wait that's so weird uhhh Anyways what my comments were all about was that your stiff seemed scrambled Like you have to put the code for your endpoints directly under the route And then some of it was incomplete as well Can u send me a screenshot of your user backend
like the entire thing??	View.py Like the second half
ok that is leave_team thats invite team thats create team thats join team	Do these all have methods directly under their routes With proper requests This is a little different from the PR I was looking at Will u make a new PR
ok will make a new pr um how do i make a new pr with no changes like i made a new branch and pushed but i have nothing to push	Just go to your branch on github And click the make pr button
um where is taht?	Compare and pull request I believe Above clone
wait no that was for the empty branch i just created	Oh I think you already have one It says view #4 Do the files u changed match your pr Like your local changes Re they the same on your pr I swear it looked different o. Your pr I'm about to get on a flight so I'll see u in a few hours
ok ya um i dont think its the same like some methods are similar but there are some methods missing bruh what LOL thats so weird i literally made this pr like after these changes.. omg ok are u arriving tonight??	Yee But I need to sleep early so I'm knocking out like Right after I shower Yeah I don't think the PR is right Can u look it up Have u done a got push from your backenduserchanges brqnch
ok ya	;
@jamiefu @jamiefu  do u have prime to buy this and have it arrive by tomorrow	"<Route exact path=""/jwt"" render={() => {
            return <JWTView refresh={this.updateUser} />"
justin is not responding to me sad	Oh what
he still hasnt responded;( jesus called you. Did you Put ur changes on master Should I pull master	Yes

Ok I will do pull origin then Instead of pull master ?? Also jamie Do u want to talk to gonzo about the cake ? Ok I pulled am okay	yes
jamie when would you like me to finish the button by like tomororw? or today? or	hopefully today before judging
oiueroiwuri what time is juding i am at dance right now and will be done at 4 but then i will have to walk back which will take me like 15 min maybe ill stay in the room and do it and then when i finish ill head back ok also okay i simply have some few questions that i didn't get the complete answer so	that's ok just do your best can u push what u have for the export endpoint rn
Wait U mean the button ??? I haven’t done anything yet I was at dance I just finished ahhh Im heading back rn	Oh Justin was asking Do I need to do this
im working on it right now i just pened my computer if u think you'll finish it faster lmk but im going to start working on it You missed a call from jesus.	Oh shit I'm back now
"also all of this is class based components im- MY BUTTON I HAVE A QUESTION OSRRY LIKE
MY BUTTON DOESNT SHOW EVEN THOUGH IT SHOULD AND IM NOT BACK SO I CANT SHOW YOU MY CODE BUT also when im setting the state variable for file like what should it be ?? should its initial value be null? bc idk what like type the file is? ok im just putting null for now but my btuton still doesnt show"	make build?
ok ill do that	does it work
just wait im adding something before i do it oh yes i see it ok so theres a button and my ref isn't working rn so nothing happens when i press but am going to try and fix jw did you finish your backend haha	come to lecture hall rn
wait media lab? wait what lecture hall? i am still in the room coding ???	what room media lab
our rom	yeah
room	do u have to be there oh well we need to deploy in half an hour
ok so should i walk there rn?? i feel like that would take time	uhhhhhh preferably as fast as possible just so we can talk about it
ok then i am coming	jack and justin are here tysm
Ok Im here Wait jamie are there any extra shirts	Lol What r u going to say
bro idk	he said that yestserdya tho
ik i tend to respond very late	lol why are you hesitating
wait hesitating to say ye s or no	to answer in general lol
heh	Wait for me hoe do u want to go eat now
jesus called you.	let's play im tennis together
Wait jamie For 5- 5a Did you just write out all the 6 cases in English ??	i wrote the code first then commented it all
did you have 6 cases?	3 large cases 3 mini casees in the first and 2 each for the other two so total like 7
Wait so the 3 large cases are if the first starts in both tuples are less than equal to or greater than right ?	yes
wait jamie arent there more than 7 like don't you also have to keep track of if the last two are the same or not?	? yeah i do  jianna when u have time can u tell me everything u think is wrong with hack CR and if u could have big changes what would that be like not procedural stuff within cr but like structural changes maybe or communication between other groups let me know
I think right now how it’s run is very messy Like we dont do anything during the meetings And sometimes I’m not sure what I should be doing after the meeting idk I feel like that’s the main problem like we meet But we don’t do anything And it’s mostly just Self driven ig once ur assigned a task But that’s a problem Bc not everyone will do their things etc ya Um another problem	hm ok that makes sense lmao
Honestly wait Maybe I’ll tell jack I will run for cr he’s f	YES please you seem to know what's going on a lot also vishruti is running for hack director i was talking to justin about dev yestserday and he was like you and vishruti will b great and i was like aha yes she is running
"wait like for cr head??
i actually dk now ok like i told jack but i also like dont rlly want to put in the work hehhhhh"	Omfg Just like kevin

OH SHUR WHAT	ahahah yes there are 47 items on it so far
Damn Thinking we had a weekend left When it turns out we only had a day left Making waffles Christmas on maseeh 6 our two times late night talks our walk to next dining in the snow seeing shree walk by ya us Covered in snow	LOL do u know when that was around what that was
Wait Which one	i put it in somewhere haha but i'm guessing around december
It was Dec 1st	wwoow specific
hi jamieeeeehooeeee okay so im like looking at spectacle right now and the tasks for march and am a little confused sorry wait so you wanted me to clean up the endpoints for spectacle because two of them were similar right?? but im looking at the endpoints (if u dont want to look i can send u a screenshot) and they seem alright? im assuming admin panel is frontend? and what is user profile?? bc i think i already made the teammate functionalities right so its mostly left for justin to do?	yeah so join team and create team are really similar because in join team you have some stuff that allows a user to create a team if the team they want to join doesn't exist already which shouldn't be allowed or you just merge the endpoint into one what do u mena by admin panel is frontend yeah i kind of want to move some of justin's frontend work to you in april because he has a lot of projects he's on point for it's the part on the top where he pulls teammates from your endpoints and other information about a user
ok wait ur so right the methods are literally the same okay i have deleted create team its basically merged already into join team so yes okay kk yes thats totally fine just wasnt sure what it was does he have that in client already should i ask him? i dont rlly see an admin component ok i pushed the dleted thing btw i just accidently was in a new branch exportcsv that i never finished also jsut to clairfy oh i see okay u answered my other question do you know what file that is in ik its in client?	U mean like a front-end for the admin panel? Thought u were making that? What file is what in U pushed the merged endpoints?
Oh I see I’m dumb okay Yes I am making the admin front end HAHHAAH That is why I cannot find And I did ... Should I not have Am sorry But it was to my own New branch So if anything is wrong it shouldn’t affect master .... Am sorry	LOL omg ok you're so motivated jianna yay
HHAHAHHA	:DD
jamieeeeee f my specatcle wont start up ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'flask_jwt_extended' i did pip install flask but idk whats wrong do you think its the virtualenv im in??	U need flask jwt
wait but like ive never had this issue before so im a little confused	Well it's a dependency so if some new virtualenv you're running doesn't have it Then it'd throw that error Because before didn't we run everything on vagrant U can also check the requirements.txt to make sure it's there And run make install 8n the virtualenv
ok tyty it now runs wait also hi okay so for the admin panel in terms of specifics of what you want on it like to be able to add teammates and stuff? or is it something that only appears for an admin? ig yes that would make sense okay so like what should the admin be able to do? like look over all the teams and projects? jamie hi i have a question if i want to like to run React & Flask on the same server/local host port and eventually not have to deploy two separate front end backend projects how would i do that	Oh shoot totally forgot to respond Put something where u can view all the DBs basically And an export function And a set deadline/timer thing Oh interesting uh Jason actually did this for spectacle but I have no idea how off the top of my head I think it's just like compiling all the react to HTML and CSS at compile time and running it like that On the flask server
wait sorrywhat are the dbs?	Database tables jiannaaaa can u help me with 8.02
yesss	OK I figured out part of it I'm eating dinner on But I'll text u after tyty
wait also for the admin panel do u just want the frontend? bc i made a dropdown menu where you can press it but like should i link to actual things im assuming yes?	uhhh if you wrote the backend for it then yes link them if not and u have time and want to write it then go for it haha why r u working so hard on spectacle lmao
HAHA i dont have much else to do... except read... and i finished my novel today so... ill start to read tomorrow again hehe i heard michigan went on lockdown	yes
;(	we are now under shelter in place orders
but	big sad
chipotle is doing free deliveries:)	oh what
YES which is why	my parents would never let me
i am ordering tomorrow	LOL
wait WHY	how was it
it was so good	also u should join bookclubyeet
i was just rereading one of my favorite novels ever	oh wait
oh wait yes i should	what book we're about to start reading
throne of glass HA what book?	oh right yeah that's so fucking good
literally	i'm reading the three body problem
fucking amazing i cant get over it	but we have 3 going on
okay	well i haven't started but i will because they won't even let me leave the house to take a walk
wait i cant leave either but for these they deliver to ur house?? and just leave it at the door? wait omg one of my friends from olin not jackie has corona im-	oh shit did u see someone from mit confirmed that they had corona
wait ya	yeah but the food
omg	and packaging
my mom was like	could have corona
they probbaly got it from the airplane? bc we left like	hmm possibly
on the 13th right	or from being on campus
and they confirmed on the 19th oh ya ok how have you been entertaining urself	sleeping LMAO half my day is spent sleeping then other half eating and watching things on my laptop oh shit yeah
HAHA	they could have had it on campus tho i'm trying to sleep earlier though
u r right	so i'm about to go to sleep actually
omfg	it's 1 am boiii
gn<3	lets get this haha gngn let's play drawful 2 tmrw
wait jamie have you done spring 2019 for 006?? im confused about num 6 like why do they have to augment the tree with with the number of nodes p.s in the subtree rooted at p it doesn't seem useful in the solution at all?	Uhhh I have but I don't remember the question It's probably a one sided wurry query
Yes that What does that mean ?? like it’s doing It’s trying to find the smaller four. Array Count *	Means u need everything from one node to the left Or one node to the rigjt
okay but u can only do that for set AVL right ?? Bc then u know everything on left Is smaller ??	Yes Wait no Sequence AVLs have internal index structure Depends on what you're traversing by
Wait so if I’m trying To find like the number of numbers before me That are smaller to em I want sequence ??	Well yeah Because then the numbers are placed in the tree According to their order
Wait but then okay like if my array is lkke [10,5,11,12,etc] 5 is the middle node and 10 is to its left and 11 is to its right in a sequence AVL Like assuming there are 8 numbs in array But then 11 Doesn’t have ljke Access to what’s before it ??	That's why u start the query at the root node
oh i see ty v mnuhc jamie<3	Yepp I'm incompetent tho lmao
literally same also	So fucked for today
i just had peanut butter and banna and im on heaven	And we have like 5 things due this sunday

BRUH DALGONA COFEE LOOKS SO AEHTSTIC	Tastes like Starbucks bro It's so good
Wait No one Is letting me into The dev meeting ??	go/zoom
Oh ducking thought I let was Go hangouts f	f YES JIANNA spectacle maintainer
hhaaahhahahhaaha	let's get this bread
 🥖 🥯	jianna which branch has your most up to date changes
Un let me check um ok i created a branch admin panel but i havent pushed it yet um the other most recent one is i think its exportcsv	U have three branches All with different commits I think
wait yes i see it exportcsv is the one	Is that the full admin panel That one has less commits than newuserbackend tho Sorry wait I'm confused what changes did u make from master to your branch justin wanted to use the admin panel to assign some starter tasks on top of it but idk how tested it is and i don't want to merge it into master until it is
ok hello i got my laptop back okay so exportcsv is like the most updated in terms of like backend stuff i accidently did my stuff in that branch instead when i was updating bc it had lal of ur updates all* and for admin panel im on the branch admin panel its local on my thing right now and i like i can push ? so right now i didn't make wait does that make sense	wait but does the admin panel branch have the same commits as the exportcsv branch like does it have those commits in its history too
i believe so bc i made it after i committed export csv so i let me chekc	how did u make it
i just did lie	did u branch off exportcsv
git brnach admin panel oh um	but off exportcsv?
"WAIT
LE TME CHEKC"	LOL
i believe this means that its branched off of head ???	uhhhhh that may be master
is taht bad	hmm
i thought branches	well yes
are supposed to be branched off of master? oh	but on the repo you're a few commits behind master can you do git pulls on each of your branchs from origin/master
wait i updated ok on each of my branches??	like anything u have that you'd potentially want to merge into master on each of those branches from origin/master so which backend stuff is this btw on exportcsv and what's on admin panel just frontend admin stuff there's no admin backend things yet right
ok so exportcsv was the changes u wanted me to make to the oirignal thing i already had like merge the two and admin panel is just frontend no	did u test the endpoints? that u changed or did u just remove one method entirely
wait i just removed on emethod entriely bc it was the exact same thing basicaly	ok is there an exportcsv function happening at all in your exportcsv branch
no ... bc i wanted it to do exportcsv but so..	lol ok
its kinda poorly named but like wait okay	have u tried running spectacle on that branch
yes	everything works fine?
ok yes when i did it but like nothing had teams or anything like it was just what it was before	right that's ok
okay ya	the frontend teammates stuff hasn't even been built yet right last time i checked w justin
ya ok gotchu	ok can u make a pr for it
dude apparently they made wait pr for	and add me and justin as code reviewers exportcsv
..................export csv? okay	i'm assuming admin panel isn't done yet right
ok i will always add u as code reiwer from now on bc last time	your local exportcsv is up to date with the remote repo right
i added i cant rmeebr who they wer elike why tf did u add me as a code eviewer and i was like	LOL
okay woopsie yes i beleive so	what's the tea here
kk added wait what what is this comment u r replying to	u were like apparently they made
OH	and then i interrupted u
no tea justin wait like him and techx devops made like this thing for mit cpw to be virtual	oh justin did it too ?
idk it just said techx dveops idk if justin was on it LOL	i totally thought devops was just @ing us in the email thread
but was like wow HAHHAHAH	because jack has said NOTHING about this thing
HAHHAHA techx devops is diff fro us doe	so i'm assuming it's just techx devops - hack
HAHHAAH	lol justin assigned an insane amount of tasks to each of the spring fishies
OH RELALY	check slack i made the ones for spectacle lmk what u think
"bruh its so gddamn hard to set up spectacle HAHHAHAHA
but i luv it ok i didn't rlly lok at anyones other than spectacles but like quill is also rlly hard to set up i think maybe its just my comptuer"	lol some of the stuff on the other stuff is even more complicated justin added all the setup and understand stuff like does michael know react bc if he does most of the frontend starter tasks will be like triivial
ok yes	oh he does? lol he'll finish it in a day
HAHHAH ya	i should just throw as much spectacle fe stuff at him while i can
he knows react very well i think HAHAHHAH	and then all of spectacle will be done while i still hold the power
HAHAHAHHAHA HAHHAHHA IM DEAD perfect	LOL
"plan BRO TODAY
MY SNICKERDOODLE COOKIES TURNED OUT AWFUL"	I SAW so funny they poofed what the heck
IM SO STUPID LIKE AS SOON AS I PUTTHEM IN THE OVEN MY DAD WAS LIKE u forgot ot put in bakin gpwder and iw aslike fuck	LOL
but too lazy I SHOULDVE TURNED BACK AND PUT BAKING PWPDERsigh	they looked so funny did they taste good
HAHHAHAHHA um	i didn't kow baking powder did that
the outside did but the inside was like dense and yucky bakin gpwoder apparently like makes the cookie spread so its not a dense ass ball of	ohhh f
flour	lol
HAHHAHA	jianna u lied to me michael told me he doesn't know react
"oh what he sent me a link tho wait give ma sec let me prove my thoughts does this not mean he knows react WAIT
DONT TELL HIM I AM TELLIN GU THIS BC i HAVE NO IDEA I F I AM CORRECT OR NOT LIKE DOESNT THAT MEAN ike create-react-app HE HAS MADE REACT"	LOL ITS TOO LATE
OIWEROUWOEIROUWEOIR DONT GO FURTHER	LOL ok he said it was flattering tho to be fair i think create-react-app makes the template for a react application soo i think he'll be fine
HAAHHA okie Jamieeeeehoeeeeee I learned a tiktok I thought u would like to see hehhehe I caved 	Ooooooh I've seen this one omg It's good join zoom
oh shot	join foool jianna sign up for the panel this thursday
Yessirrrrr It’s going to be Such a diverse panel He hehehhe wait jamie was it gavel that had the exportcsv stuff?? im like trying to find it bc i rememebr it was in gavel but ok wait i think i found the csv code	yeah i think so gavel has an import csv idk if they have an export
wait question what is the format that they want to convert it from like is it just anything?? like is there a specific format their project is in?? bc i think ik how to do this but not sure what to convert from	who is they and what does that have to do with project lol when u import csv to gavel they need everything in specific columns and rows so that's the format u should try to match i think
wait i mean spectacle like im trying to create an export csv  button right	oh yeah
so like whats the format of the proejct	??????
im trying to export to csv as?	you're trying to export all the projects
oh wait so like rows of the project names?	are projects well not just project names it just has to be in the same format as how gavel expects it so like if gave has like project name, project team, etc et that's how it needs to be exported too lol does that did that make sense or am i confusing u more lol
um wait give me a sec wait so does this not in gavel write this to a csv??	wait yeah i think it does
so...	you can copy the format if you want yeah but you wouldn't be able to exactly because our table columns don't quite match
wait ya bc the data is different right?	yeah
okay but im just not sure like what data we want to include?	you can use that method as a dummy to see what format it should be in tho
okay wait so if i copy this over	like if u just startup a local gavel instance and hit export u can see what format the data should bve in
ok so basically this should so what im trying to do is create a csv that they can input into gavel??	yes
okay i gothcu	and that function works as long as the data inputted is correct yessir
wait sorry where do u find the email and password for admin? for gavel?	go/accounts i belive if not maybe it's in the config somewhere oh wait it's probably in the config i'm dumb
wait by config do u mean config.yaml wait sorry where is teh username i am	Username is admin Sorry
It’s okay HAHHAA	Apologies my friend
ok so its just a simple drop down but i pushed the frontend for dropdown menu and am working on exportcsv ah woops sorry i named it rlly weird bc it changed on me last minute f	oh nice wowowo i'm excited to see it ah shit do we have a 006 pset this week i totally forgot to put it on my to do list fuckkk
Wait we don’t No pset his week	oh shit we don't why
Quiz next week	ffff we didn't even learn anything yet
Just graphs	ik that's like nothing and i don't even really know graphs do i i don't
Yes u do 🧐🧐	uh no i don't i've skipped like 2 of jason's lectures and there's only been like 4
GGAHAHHAA but Alex’s chen 🥺 Wait I thought Jason’s lectures Well the first 2 We’re super confusing bc He was confusing himself And woukd pause For like a minute And be like wait no And then go back and I would b like wtf	dude i watched him on 3x he NEVER paused whenever he started writing down things that were not the english alphabet i was like aight i'm out
Why Would u watch On 3x HAHHAHAH how doi Do u Understand	BRO 3x is the ONLY way to go
At that speed omg I think my max is 2x	i installed this extension that lets me go faster than what youtube and in-page video players on mitx allow
But usually 1.5x	it's great
omfg HAHAHAHA WHY	once u get used to it it's like
THEN U CANT UNDERDRAND	my brain is totally zoned in
wow That just save Sm time	like before if he pauses i just get so distracted by my phone but here it's like i have to play this game of
HAHHAHAHHA	focus so hard and make sure u can comprehend his words wait yeah lec only takes like 20 minutes now it's crazy just made me realize that if all lecturers were more efficient we'd be in and out
also wait question sorry is there like a psecific file i should create or put this method in like should this be in server? sorry ik this is probably like comon sense but im not sure	the export csv? wait no don't feel sorry lol i think settings/view.py in server is the right place oh btw is that where u built admin panel backend stuff ^
okok gotchu and yes	ok great yeah just like in gavel u can add the helper functions to the bottom
where r u?	oh hi i removed myself since i'm hosting this thursday's panel instead
oh theres a panel wowoo	yeee you're the panel bro
wait I’m the panel oh u mean this panel ??? oh danggg	yeah lol this thursday right
oh yes wait also question so is this exportcsv button only admin can do right?	Yep
"ok wait quick question so what u did in the methodbelow request_body = request.get_json() how do u check whats in that variable? like how do u know parameters are mapped to what like open_time = request_body[""open_time""]? like how do i check what parameters are in it?"	U can print request_body Or use postman to make a request to that endpoint
"wait jamie i am v sorry but i cant remmeber how did u fix   ""msg"": ""Missing cookie \""access_token_cookie\""""
 i remember you like wrote a method that had the cookies for users? but now that im running settings its not working so i was jw where u impelemented the method?"	It's under auth I'm pretty sure The first few endpoints /login/test And a couple others Or u could just login right The login button works now
Wait it doesn’t for em Oh wait Wait ya It gives me an operational error	Can u read it off to me Or send me a screenshot Is what. I meant What r u trying to login as
wait i didn't even login i just pressed the login button and it gave me that error like it showed up to the blueprint screen and it ried to enter something and it crasehd	What's your config look like Also what branch are u working on Because if you're working on a new feature on top of another feature
oops i am stil l working on admin panel	Just make a new branch off master Oh Where did u branch admin panel off of
um i think master? i think this was the problem i talked to u about earlier? let me chekc	Well like so the reason. U don't have an access token cookie is because u haven't logged in Logging in returns the jwt token u need for all other endpoint calls
wait but i cant log in	Yeah Ik Lol
and thats bc i dont have jwt token? or i need to log in to get jwt token	Latter
so can i get jwt token without logging in ??? i see in ur auth file like what u did does that extend to settings.py? oh i see what u mean ok	Not really u need to return the jwt token after a valid login
ok so then... can i test without jwt tokent hen	What does your config say
wait by config do you mean config.example	config.py
i dont think i ahve one	It's where auth pulls the jwt variables from Well sir
it just says configloader.py	Why
and configprovider.py	Server/config.py Does that not exist
no	R u sure you're running spectacle lol Those two files like
wait yes i think i am??	Don't exist anywhere LMFAO Debugging with u is always so intetesting Is this the admin panel repo
hahhaha okay like i see it here but the actual file doesn't exist	OK so
wait sorry what does repo mean	That's not good Sorry I meant branch Of the repo
yes	Like repository
adminpanel branch theres config.mk?	Can u try merging in master into your branch
ok wait so do git pull ??	No there's some git merge command Hold on let me think
ok so git rebase master?? or git merge master? it says recommended git rebase master?	So get the most recent version of master by switching to master and doing a git pull Then go back to admin panel branch and git merge master There will be merge conflicta
pl ok*	Take masters changes unless it's your new admin panel features And also can u delete some of your remote branches that are no longer needed
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in client/src/App.js wait but that is my fixed admin panel	"What is ""that"""
ok wait i am just going to accept current change it was like y dropdown menu i added thats not on master yet	OK yeah You're just merging master stuff into your local branch To try to fix your login issue
client/src/App.js: needs merge i cant like pop any of my new changes unless i merge?	What does pop mean
like i made some changes to settings views.py and i did git stash before i merged.. so now im just trying to do git stash pop.. or i can rewrite..	What Wait If u have merge conflicts u need to resolve them Before u can pop your changes
wait id id resolve? i pressed accept current change or should i be doing	For all your conflicts?
something more i only had one?	Yeah but it's saying you're not done merging client/src/App.js: needs merge This is the error message u sent me before
ya.. but i did????	U need to finish merging them in after resolving your conflict
like i pressed accept current change wait so then do i do git add? my changes?	
ok i was just lookinga t that hehehhe	I need to take a shower rn but this will be faster if we just call lol How about 3pm Yeah u need to commit your merge lol Otherwise it won't know that your changes are resolved
ok tis has been committed ty ok yes go take shower	Lol ok I'll be back in a bit sorry forgot to text u do u still need help
"ya..im still a bit confused on how to do the jwt identity like i am able to login now but {
  ""msg"": ""Missing cookie \""access_token_cookie\""""
} i still get that when i try to run"	you're able to login? do u have a config file now
ya i just press login and it logs me in !! no i dont think i do	because you still need that just make a config.py file and copy in the environment variables from config.example should be in the server folder
is this the same thing?	no
ok do i also just make config.py in the server folder	"DEBUG=True

ok has been made was that supposed to fix the jwt error? bc i still get missing cookies?	what endpoint are u trying to reach that gives u that error
 just to see what request-body prints LOL	when you login does anything rpint to terminal it's supposed to print your token from here
f but it does not??	can u show what happens right under the GET /api/login call the screenshot you sent me is a png GET request
wait omfg i do see it im dumb ok wait so then do i just put this in postman	nah lol we should probably fix the problem let's just calll rn
The video chat ended.	join now!!!!!!!
oh sht okay i have a question for later but basically is this exportcsv supposed to be for like every single project that exists okay that would make sense tbh	i will answer this question in a bit
ok ok also feel free to answer this question later but	lol yes yes every single project submitted
okay this is probably a dumb quesiton but like to get that dictionary or just that projects in general do i have to call the method or can i just ilek from server.models import Project and do projects = Project.query.all() like is there a preferred okay wait maybe ill just do the latter bc that makes more sense to me? or should i be calling response	wait what does this mean
wait so in the image like	i think this makes sense
okay ty	yus
hi another question is this like their desired prizes?? bc on the excel it wants desired prizes?	list of prizes you applied for
i see okay wait so its like an actual array or like actual text ok its ok doesn't matter too much hehhhaa wait also sorry i am kind of confused	ok wait i'll look into this more in a few more minutes
wait its okay i cant find a parameter	event is almost over
for files used	i'll check
okok gotchu also wait sorry i also cannot find any variable for person's screen name wait ok method is kind of long but i just cant seem to find those two parameters??	Hmm OK I'll look in 15 min Sorrylol I promise I will look tn I just am not Available atm
ok ahha ty	yeah so file url is where they upload their code so we have a code link which should be what you're thinking of and for person's screen name how is that different from creatordata.name if it's redundant u can just duplicate
ok wait so then am i given that code link anywhere? or like where would i get that link? would we just manually input or? wait its like not their name the screenanme is like a nickname or something?? or username? but not their name	That's probably just a devpost thing U can put in bs for now for that column
but how okay	That should be in the db Project db
wait its not wait let me send u pic	Ywah code_link
wait no thats like the code link to their project like there are two links that need to be inputted	? Is that if someone submits an image Or dmth
do you mean the fle url	Yes
hmm	That's what u were asking about right
that might be ig ok then ok	image_key is broken but u can sub that in for now
videolink it is then ok ty	Tbh I don't think any of this stuff is needed to populate the gavel oage Just like project name and table should be enough U can check on gavel
wait that was the gavel	But it probably just needs this format so it knows how to find the other things
thing justin sent me	No I know I mean
oh	How gavel processes it when u upload it Because on the admin panel u saw that none of this information pops up Its just how it's always been uploaded that's all
ahh ok wait also aoiuweoiruwer im literlaly so sorry for bothering u but i just dk like when i run this get request it says i need javascript, but this works for like get users, so does that mean im not supposed to be retruning like the final csv? or like its not letting me print anything that i am trying to print?	Usually when it says u need js it's not actually that It's a logic error in your code or you're trying to pull some information that dne Idk how does data to CSV work
ok um but im doing a try except now so i feel like that should take care of my logic error like jsut in general right?	Is everything in the try except?
basically except like user = get_jwt_dentity wait like it should print that right even if it doesn't wokr??	Ummmm yes Are making the request to the right endpoint
to localhost:5000/api/exportcsv?	api/setting/exportcsv probably right
wait another hopfuly quick question, so if i relogged in and got the token from that login and put that new token in and it says token has expired does that mean something is wrong w my method or the token i am assuming the latter but just want to? wait literally jsut ignore me i think i got it	Token yeah If u just rerun /login/test on the server it's chill Postman*
wait question TypeError: The view function did not return a valid response. The return type must be a string, dict, tuple, Response instance, or WSGI callable, but it was a list. if flask methods dont allow this then how do i return a csv file?? bc it seems i can only return a json encoded thing?	What does data to CSV string do That mwthod Do u have to return something How does it work on gavel
like i think it needs the csv file	csv is probably a package u can import
wait yes i do import csv so rn im just returning the result array but i cant even do that bc i dont think flask lets you return anything other than like a response	Yeah so just pass in your array data to the data to CSV method And return the output of that instead
wait but like wait so like this current method i cant return my array data though so how would my data to csv method get it...	It's an endpoint right
wait like the flask method would let me return even the array	Yeah the flask method is an endpoint right
yes	So call data to csv string on the the array u wanted to return And then return the output of that in your response
wait that is gavel's method they use ok i see so like create a csv but then	U can copy it iver
call data to csv string and return that i see that is ok ay unders to	As a response object
d do	Lol
apparetly strings are alowed	Ok
so i dont even think response is needed? The return type must be a string, dict, tuple, Response instance, or WSGI callable, but it was a list.	Alright but the return from output.value might not be a string It's probably a callable That invokes downloading of a csv
wait is that okay though bc gavel also uses data from csv string oh wait im dumb okay yes ok amazig it has returned jamie,,jamie,,,,[],[],j1,StartHacking,,Admin,User,admin@hackmit.org,MIT,0 michael,,michael, Neck South High School,0 i think i am like thats the string i think thats okay?? or is michael not ur teammate	Wait but u don't want it to return as a strinf No he's not
f wait datatocsvstring	We don't put in teammates in the dB het
oH i see wait he has the same project id as you thats how i checked for teammates.. for now ig? okay wait but datatocsvstring changes it to a string wait so sorry what am i trying to return	Uhmm OK so for your first question it should be generating different project IDs for every submission so I'm not sure why it's saying it's the same And for your second q yes it should be a csv string but it has be something that invokes downloadable right
wait okay so i savecsv before	Idk how that occurs tbh
so it has downloaded to speactcle folder it just doesn't return if that maeks sense? omg WAIT IT LOOKS SO GOOD	Oh it downloads the data ? OK then you're goof
HEHHEHEHHEHH EYS AND YOU BOTH ARENT TEAMMATES OKAY THIS IS AMAZING okay i should maybe add the column titles	Oh wow that's great Idk if that's the way we should download it tho Just like automatically Do u know what I mean
ya okay that makes snese... umm but like isn't that what they want like as soon as they press the button	Like most things when u hit the download it asks where u want to save
download automatically oh iseeeee i see what u meannn	Because it shouldn't be like
ok um	In the deployment folder umif u know what I mean When we host it somewhere we don't want to the file to live on the server
wait it is in the deployment folder? like rn its in spectacle not in server	Well yeah but when we host spectacle somewjere It will be on a servef
oh i see okay so should i fix that rn or is that a later problem	U should go to sleep lil Lol
wait like just genuine question HAHAH like do u think	Um yeah it needs to be fixed eventually
okay	But we can look at it later This looks really good thi
got it ty and wdym i SHOULD BE SLEEPING YOU SHOULD BE SLEEPING	Yeah lol I should be Im too tired to get up from the couch and go upstairs
HAHHAHAHA another option can sleep on the couch	Ouch Really tryna make me sleep on the couch in my own house
u r the one being too lazy smh	When u have time just delete your old remote branches too I am lol So lazy
wait i thought u already did wait like on github or on my computer also i did all of this on jianna/adminpanel wait i am so bad at github am sorry next time will create new branch that will not be off of master	I haven't yet I thought u knew better which branches were old
wait does this mean pull request	On the repo to answer your w
okay i will figure it out with googling	That's fine New branches should be off master pribably So idk where else you'd want to base it on Yeah so the remote repo has like 20 branches rn for certain features that we no longer need So I just wanna prune it down a bit Feel free to delete any of my old ones as well is your urop prof's name tegmark
yupp why? did he make urop posting hahha	dude your urop professor is a fucking legend in physics
YES oh what RLLY HHAHAH wait how do u know what	dude have u even looked up this guy's name
am so confused no	he has like a bajillion books to his name
oh wtf	the search results are filled with this guys shit i just sent him an email
LMFAO WHY R U SEARCHING HIM UP HAHHAH ohhhh about nlp	i've been trying to do some nlp shit for a while man
??	yes
ahhhh	are u still uroping with him we couuld urop together omg so fun
yapppp hHAHHAH	why is tegmark doing nlp stuff tho lol
YYAYAYYA	he's a physics guy
idk ig hes interested in the news	how's your urop been so far tho
boring af but u will prob have fun?	oh what why is it fake nlp
um tbh idrk like ik this is very vague like he mainly has this graduate student do all the nlp work like the grad students used to go to harvard but now goes to mit? so like he usually does the work by himself and ya	so what do u do
i basically get paid to do nothing lOL i do like some like create csv files hahhahha oh i searched him up dang i thought his wife was so young the first time i met her dangggg	lmao bro i feel like i'd heard tegmark's name even before i came to mit
oh what	yeah like tegmark yanno it just rings a bel, even though i don't know why also  what are your plans for the summer rn and here's a music urop that needs react skills
lmfao no nope he asked me to continue so i was just like ok! and ill intern at my externship place hahhaha do u know what ur doing?	Oh noixee No I have zero plans as of now Would continue at my externship place except it's msft and they don't want me back lmao
wait why DONT they want u back bruh wait does ur current urop guy not want to continue?? wait keep me updated i hope u find something <3	"Lol they do their hiring cycles way before If I do ""satisfactorily"" But also like idk I'm not super interested 8n his work so I'm just trying to get 8nto more NLP stuff"
ohhh wait jamie do simple graphs never have cycles?? like are there key words to let us know there are no cycles in a graph?	yes dag time
Also jamie hi I will try to make today’s meeting but I spilled water all over my laptop so my parents are trying to go to the Apple store rn so I might have to be at the Apple store but if we don’t end up going I’ll come in like 10 min	oh no ok lol jack mightve texted u already let him iknow clumsy jianna
wait jamie about what u said for number 3 yesterday is the subproblem like for all u in incoming edges of v if w(u,v) is odd then we do 1+ X(s,u,odd) and nothing to even and if it is even then we do 1+X(s,u,even)? wait where do the lkke cross parity considerations occur ? Oh wait jk I see Wait does that seem about right Wait but we can’t just do that right bc then we’re adding 1 each time ?	it's not 1 you're adding O(s,u,even) when weight is odd where O represents the number incoming to that v where the path weights are even
"wait I am adding even though wait sorry what am I adding O(s,u,even) too bc I get that this represents the number of even paths up to this vertex but if I see an odd weight like That’s now an odd path but I’m
Not adding a path right So do I just set O(s,u,odd)=O(s,v,even)"	Right your adding all the evens because they become odd paths
Wait that’s what I was doing before like for each vertex if it’s weight is odd then the number of odd paths is 1+O(s,u,even)?	No Not one plus
Wait so then just O(s,u,even)?	For every incoming vertex
Ok I think I kind of see ty sorry thinking about recursion is so very hard of me	yeah you're good
also I was going to start working on spectacle but so my computer broke so I closed it but are my old changes in Jianna/adminpanel lkke Im master? Like I don’t think it is so ig my question is lkke How do I get that branch if I’m on a diff computer ?	Did u push your recent changes to the remote repo? U should do a git fetch Then checjout
I pushed to Jianna/adminpanel But how do I get that branch ?? so like Got fetch Jianna/adminpanel	Like git fetch And then git checkout jianna/....
Okokoko tyyyyy Wait sad it doesn’t Have any of my changes ???	well if u never pushed it wouldn't lol sorry tho :((
Wait but I did push....? wait like before there were comments wait am confused	uhhhh i'm confused too texted u in zoom call  this the link i sent u some stuff from if u don't happen to catch my messages before meeting is over
wait also jamie Is our solution to num 2 O(n^4)?? Bc for lkke X(I) there’s o(n) subproblem  and each one takes O(n^ 3) Like for Y(I,j) there’s n^2 subproblem and each one takes o(n) So when we call X each time it could call Y which would be n^3 that would be n^4? Wait jk I see	Haha mb
Wait jamie Ok so I got this for the recursion But am confused as to How we return a partition Ok wair jk I will just say parent pointer lmfao	Oh rip I forgot to say parent pointer on mine f Have to go back and change it
	Lol Lmao r u excitrd
Bruh the one things I’ve been looking forward to since like 3 yesss algo	Lollllllp I hope it's a good one
I rlly hope it is Like I rlly rllly Ugh I’m so exited	haha i hope so too
wait jamie is there a link to like where we can set up everything for spectacle?? like ive written up the connection to frontend to backend but then went to test it and realized bc im on a new computer i dont have anything so ive downloaded node js but like i cant find the step by step instrcutions i folloed before and it doesn't say on the readme??	hi you need to run make install all the dependencies are in the makefile and requirements.txt make sure u have a virtualenv set up it should be on the readme tho? what else r u missing
wait the thing is it wont let me set up a virtual env i did  what that link todl me to do but i remmeber before i also installed like an app? is that necessry?	what app windows dev environment is difficult you need to add it to your path or you can install it with the --user tag and it should be easier to find easiest thing to do is just do all of this in an ubuntu wsl oh wait are u on the new mac now
wait yes wait let me see ok i did add to my path hi jamie i am sorry to bother you again but i am utterly confused ok so for the command virtualenv -p python3 venv it says that so then i tried doing pip3 install virtualenv and online to fix this issue everyone says this but i already did it and it doesn't work?? and ive also done pip3 install wheel so like idk what to do	that's just an upgrade for pip you should try to do like pip3 install -U pip3 or smth like that
so i am assuming i dont hav epip3?? based on this eror message and that i should try and get it? ok wait i think my main question is just what is that??? is that an error message liek it doesn't tell me what i have to download?? ok wait am i supposed to add it to my bash profile?	uh it looks like it made your virtualenv correctly tho did you try activating it
ok wait yes i did sorry i forgot to update you now am struggling with psycopg2	lol uhhhh this is a mac problem i don't know how to solve hold on  few solutions in here i thought i sent julia a link before but i didn't but i think she also resolved this issue before as has zoe
okok yes i remmebr resolving this w u when i had my mac before we added like some path or something but cannot remmeber link	oh we did? must have smth to do with postgres not being on the os path
"f i think i screwed tihngs up more OIWUEROIWERU h8 tis MKAE MISTNALL
WOEIRUOWIEUR MAC OWIUEROUWER"	Lol what What did u do
ok i deactivated and found the old link i iused but simply odesn't work but i think it should work so will figure something out hopefully	sorry i have no idea what you're saying but also since you have a new mac this is an opportunity to have a really clean setup so i would recommend being really careful with like installations and stuff
 That kind of went down drain BUT I installed wack things Inside my Venv So I just deactivated It was quite Beautiful	uh deactivating is alll well and fine but u can't run spectacle without the venv
wait ik	you should probably remove it and remake it
So I just	oh
Crashed new one ?? Created Woops Wait how should I go about Being clean I like have a better sense of my computer	so like rm -rf venv
But also Don’t know that much	should remove the entire virtualenv and then recreating it is the same
Oh I did not know that ok	"and about your python and pip installations those definitely need to be figured  out check python --version and python3 --version pip --version and pip3 --version as wel those should help you see what u have and the ""which ____"" command will tell you where it's installed to"
Wait how is this Supposed to help me ??	yeah so you have two versions of python but just one pip which is p good
Ok YAYA	uh but when you run spectacle you'll need to alias python=python3
wait do I need to do that if I always call python3 Like I just never run w python?	" yeah because the make files use ""pythono"" i think so anything that calls python by default you'll want it to reference python3 instead i haven't done a permanent fix on my system yet but basically you can make the alias python=python3 permanent by adding it to your bash profile yeah otherwise you can run it on every startup of a terminal"
Wait so is the bash profile like something I create on my computer ? Bc everywhere I’m searching is like create this file Or is it something Built in already ?	so mac has this thing called terminal right and it's basically a command line system for your computer there are many different types of shells but the most popular one is bash which is born again shell and that's essentially what mac terminals are
so if i have to add something like a new alias	and there's a few hidden files that configure it
do i create a new one each time?	no so it exists
so i just	so you'd add a line to it
have to find it?	yeah it's hidden but if you run ls -al from root you should be able to see it be careful with it tho because it uses those finals on every startup of a shell files*
oh interesting so its like one of these/ ?? ok but i see what u mean ok gotchu	ayee
i think*	i don't see it but i'm not sure where it is
JAMIEEEEE I GOTNIT NSKXKQKKSOQ IM CEYING OMFG WNOLQOSOAOOWA RHIS TOKN A GOOQDKLQOSOAQ OKAY BEAUTIUFK STUPWOSALWLOS	hahahahahha yayyyyy
ok wait also so im running make build rn and for every single component the .css file is mising so im just like copying over from online ist aht okay?	what css file
or does tha tmean	uh what
like ProjectsCard.css is missing from mine and like SubmitView.css and like every single css is missing idk why? but it is? so im just like going to the online github and copying the file over? like just adding that file is that like okay to do	ok wait probably not the move lol did u clone the repo properly and did make build run successfully
um i just had what was on my laptop already like it was on my icloud and make build is not running succesfully bc of all the css's so like i have already copied some of them	wait what
but i feel like there are a lot so	yeah no hold on ok so i mean do you have the client directory
yes	ok my guess is that your laptop's repo is not up to date and or is missing a lot of stuff what does git status do ok see how all your files have htose .icloud extensions let's check origin
wait does that mean	git remote -v ok so what does git pull do i mean your whole repo is just wrecked lol do u need anything on it cuz icloud backed everything up but added all those extensions is there some way u can unpack it if not i would just start clean
ohhhh ok so i should just delete okay i will like copy my csv code but i think thats about it gotchu	well if the pull was successful maybe some things were fixed you can continue to give it a shot here but idk
so would you like in ur case just delete and redownload just wnat to double chekc	i would say if there's no big changes you've made you can just reclone somewhere else
"and delete this one jamie a slice of apple pie is $2.50 in Jamaica wait also question i am still a bit confused on should i be creating a new branch off of master??
or no bc i remeber i did and there was somehing wrong about that but not entirely sure"	lol where is this coming from yeah i think you should
ya bruh and a slice of apple pie is $3.00 in the bahamas	bro where is this coming from lol
These are the pie rates of the Caribbean	why are u looking this up lol
ITS SO FUNNY WOEIRUOEWIRHAHHAHAHAH hello wait can you send me the info in your config.py file again? i forogt to copy that over;( wait im kiddin gi found it in my trash hehhehe ok all good	hello oh ok bueno your typing always sends me also i gotta knock out now but good luck lmk if u need anymore help
Ya u should go TO SLEEP A wait jamie so i was tad bit strugglin g abit and was searching stuff online and found this  can i just use this instead LOL	Lol I suppose if it's maintained well U can But is there no export CSV functionality on gavel They definitely need it to export to devpost So
ok no its just like the thing i wrote works its just am struggling to like like when i press the button i redirect the link to jsut be /api/settings/exportcsv but then it like goes to a diff web page like that is just the csv file but like without the csv if that makes sense like its the get request so im trying to figure out a way where i can like quickly do the get request but like not go to that page?? i think in general i shouldn't redirect	Wait wdym by this I guess if you hit a button you can make a call within the endpoint to some function that returns the content u need Wdym by redirect
wait okay so i was looking at what like submit did and stuffand like it makes sense like once you press the submit button the url goes to localhost:5000/submit like thats the redirect? so i was jsut doing to /api/settings/exportcsv but that led to the actual get request page if that makes sense wait but like for this like the get request is what i need? like it will only download the csv so i think tell me if this is okay idea like idk just return all the info and then get that info and then compile it on frontend? ok i think this may be move	Hmm like why can't u specify a redirect 0age with flask There's like a redirect function u can use To tell it where u want it to go Like in sign in there's redirect
wait like i can but it just stays on the get page if that makes sense? like i think when u press a button you wouldn't want to go to a different page? like i want to content on the link but not go to the apge if that makes sense so i think what i will do is maybe just return the info i want to put in the excel file? and then do all the work on the frontend	 this is the stuff on gavel i was talking about have u tried something like this yet
do you mean that part	"like each of those endpoints is an endpoint to create a csv from db information so you just need to make an endpoint that looks essentially the same as tha def data_to_csv_string(data):
    output = io.StringIO()
    writer = csv.writer(output)
    writer.writerows(data)
    return output.getvalue() there's the data_to_csv_string function from utils as well it's p short you need some sort of user output right so the io writer is p important"
wait yes i was basically trying to do this okay for this is it like on the frontend this csv string is like how does it become turned to a csv?	uh there's a package callled csv that writes it to interactive output using the csv.writer and stringio you want it to return some IO output which will induce a csv download  and if u want it to redirect after flask.redirect(location, code=302, Response=None) here's how you would do that why do u have to do it on the frontend tho i would expect all processing stuff to be done on the backend
hmmm wait give me a sec and i will respond after i attempt to try this way out sorry i feel like this isn't a hard task at all but idk why its so hard for me lmfao	you can try for now just copy pasting the endpoints over and modifying it to fit the spectacle dbs lol no worries it's strange because it's not a webpage or data you're trying to return for io stuff usually there's some io object that needs to be used
ok wait so like it returns me this string thingy magicer but like before i had a savecsv file but thats in python like is there something that can change whatever this is to a csv? like am just confused bc this isn't a csv?	is this what's returned from your running spectacle when you access the exportcsv endpoint did u make sure to use an io writer
so like thats what im returning and thats how im getting it its just like am i supposedt o expect a csv file??	um so that thing returned is a csv string
ok it says its an object which im asuming	so like that's how csv's are stored in raw text format
is csv string soooooo ok	i'm trying to think now about how u can induce some prompt for a user to save it to their machine
wait i can do that like wait sorry so like i know how to do it so that like when the useres press the button they can do something but like i am unsure about what they are supposed to do with this string??? bc dont they want a csv file???	yeah you want it to induce a download yeah it looks like you have a couple of options you can user flask's send_file or send_from_directory  i think send from directory may work is it inducing any download from the io writer when you go to that link
is the directory like the app.config part where i want to put the data string??	no it's where on the server u have the file saved already also i'm pretty sure the io writer method u have now should be working and inducing a save why don't you push your code and i'll take a look
ok ok i made a pull request did u see it? ok wait so this is on the sever? so  data i was getting was from the server like on the frontend side lol ok wait so what i was thinking idk if were on the same page like this method returns a csv string and then on the frontend when they press the button it uses that string and changes to csv? or is this not what u r talking about i feel like u are talking about converting it to csv on server side?	yeah i was thinking server side uses what string the csv string? that's already a csv u just need something that prompts a save now
i see ok so your flask send_flask thing only works onthe server side? right bc its falsk? flask*	send_file u mean? um if it's what you return it should return the send_file response
"wait sorry im so confused def download_file(filename):
    return send_from_directory(app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'],
                               filename, as_attachment=True) so for this if i have this in setting views.py i would be like oh ok app.config['random folder name'], file i want to save it as but like how does it know what file????? like is the filenmae my csv string? and then on the front end i just call this download_file method?"	"wait i'm confused app.config is the way that gavel represents the directory to save to and filename is the name of the file u want to save in that directory sorry these are things that have already been saved there so you have a directory which filename ""filename"" and sending that file from the directory is what that is doing you need to save the csv string as a csv file ahead of time in that location beforehand ok wait jianna i don't thkn u need to make those changes have u been looking at the gavel repo because i just tested it with allen and the code base on gave does send the file over to download"
so	 u can try it here too admin change-this-before-deploying
this line send its?? sends it**?	yes it sends an io object
wait okay but my point is like to access this get request i basically just like add this url to the current url but it stays at that page like i make the redirect variable /api/setting/exportcsv	oh i don't think u need to have the button redirect to that endpoint hold on
oh wait i thought that was my task? like if u click the button it should download right like it downloads but just stays on the page which i dont think it should do? so like thats why i was trying to instead of redirecting to the page like retrieve the data from the get request and save csv like on the frontend which also idk if good idea	wait yeah if u click the button it should just download it doesn't need to redirect anywhere
right but like here	where do u want to redirect it
like it only downloads	oh you're saying it is redirecting rn
if i go to the link but bc i redirect to the link like it just stays there if that makes sense	yeah i know what you're saying
so like my method before was fine too like i just did savecsv ok ya	is it downloading to where you want it to
ya like my method before just downloaded to server folder which ik you said we should fix	but now is it still downloading to the server folder with the gavel method no right ok so i think yo] just need to set it as a hyperlink not actually html i'm sure there's a way u can do it in react
oh shit ok let me try that	but u don't need to make a get request or hmm i'm not sure or u can try the redirect response oh that doesn't induce a download? i'm not sure
wait actually am confused again LFMAO SORRY WAIT how did they get that .csv ok ya im using the redirect response rn	did u try without the redirect and just reutrn a response your other option is to do smth like this
wait yes it works	oh ok
lie the response thing works	what did u do just set a hyperlink oh
wait	but is it going back to root correctly
havent fixed issue yet but if i got to api/settings/exportsv a csv downloads to chrome :)	oh that's good
its quite beautiful when i saw that i was like holyyyy	how are you going to induce that download tho lol like button click?
thats a good question wait yes thats what im trying to do rn am in proccess figuring out why not working bc	ok lmk haha
it wokred before???!??!	you've been working so hard but yeah the screenshot i sent you is smth u can also try if it redirects you to exportcsv and doesn't take u back
ok ya so rn basically like when i click a button it goes to the link then i need to refresh and then it downloads but its stays on the page rip but now whats better is that okay?? like its just the link that has changed? but still same spectacle page? and i need to refresh once i clik lmfao ok i pushed i guess i will call this a win??	Wait u pushed to your branch?
Ummm Maybe I shouldn’t ??? Woops Im sorry it’s just to my local one tho Like Jianna/csc	Oh ok Yeah There's nothing wrong w thay Also u don't need the PR for me to see your updates I can just see them from your branch if u push If u wanna go in and delete your PR sometime we'll make a new one when the feature is completed But yeah when u click the download button it should)d just prompt a download It shouldn't do it automatically And you shouldn't have to refresh for it to download I can take a look tmrw Dwai for nkw
Okok ya it like doesn’t do it automatically But it needs me to refresh to download 	i just looked at it i think you're not supposed to be doing a setstate with redirect notice how all of the other handles have some route path because they're rendering different react pages window.location.href try that like in handleLogin
ok I gotchu like ok	maybe not window.location beause that requires an absolute path basically you're not rendering a different page you're making a call to that endpoint
wiat ya was just about to ask bc as i was writing was a little conufsed wait ya so like before i as doing axios.get() but that is like if you're getting data ? and it only does it in async component didmount so like would download as soon you login which is not what we want...

        <Form action="" method=""post"" enctype=""multipart/form-data"">
          {form}
          <Button positive type=""submit"">Submit</Button>
        </Form>
      </div> this is how it looks like on SubmitView.js"
wait ya but form has like the thing called action but dropdown doesnt??	hmm when you declare a button can't you associate some action with a click to it
"yes so like onclick i refer to a method called this.handlExport hbut like action="" i cant' just do that?"	i'm not sure lolll idkk react well enough i can look it up
wait im like p sure i can't do that? like thats just a link? and im p sure dropdown.item doesn't have the attribute of item sorry action(* it has onClick instead	yeah u can use onclick 
wait yesbut	wait yeah i'm seeing a lot of references to axios.get
like idk why but i feel like axios.get() only works in component did mount and i think it only does for fetch too ill try but like i cant put it in component did mount bc that would just download as soon i reach like the main page? but lmk try let me*	oh no yeah ok don't do that then but
wait ok that was my problem with axios.get() but im not sure about fetch	i don't think u need compoentntdid mount
wait wdym?	"getNext = (ev) =>{
      ev.preventDefault()
      axios.get(' 
    filter[orderby]=rand&filter[posts_per_page]=2')
      .then(res=> this.setState({quotes:[...this.state,res.data[0]]}))
    } this is the handler i see for onClick for the stack overflow thing i'm looking at my 6.08 final project is also using axios get requests upon button requests too so i def know it won't just do it on page load handleAddUser = (id, name) => {
      if (name === '') return
      this.setState({userId: id, userName: name, ready: false })
      axios({
        method: 'post',
        url: '
        data: qs.stringify({
          user_id: id,
          username: name,
          ready: false
        }),
        headers : {
          'content-type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded;charset=utf-8'
        }
      })

    } here's some stuff my teammates wrote for axios"
ok wait let me try ty vmuhc	yeah p np
update am not sure axios.get works??	what's up
"ummM basiclaly like i do axios.get(localhost:5000 thingy magic/api/setting/exportcsv).then(console.log9""WLERIUIOEWR"") and it prints PIWUREOIEWUR but it never downloads my thing so like ik its passing thorugh this axios .get thing? bc its printing but IS SIMPLY NOT DOWNLOADING"	what prints
"sorry for the late response i didn't entirely feel like dealing w speactcle yesterday soooooo but basially l ike PIWUREOIEWUR prints to tehc onsole which is supposed to happen after like it ""gets"" bc like axios.get( whatever).then(console.log(OIWERE)0 if that makes sense"	Hmm idk lol Tbh I'm dying rn cuz if 036 so I'm probably gonna be MIA for the rest of the week and a half

🤠 I’m so hungry I think I might die Fuck Why did I do this to myself	text your mom real quick also he's not watching u rn go take out your contacts i DO NOT want to do Portrait bias but lowkey he wants me to i think cuz i have vision experience i will not sign up for it

Change the.numbers to lmfaooo Yes Quite beautiful	you done good
 Bruh What is ur Second	"I""M THINKING"
is word bias also like nlp	yes but it's not that novel i think we should do topic or portrait tbh
ok	even though i have portrait exp
Don’t do Topic It’s just	i'll do portrait then
Map generation	OK let's go portrait 2
I was topic last sem smh Worst Decision of my life	ok LOL
do we have To do a third ????? I think	should we do opinion adjective is that interesting does it seem novel
Wair ok last semester it was just someone Gathering a list Of opinion Adjectives	hmm ok maybe not
Idk if he’s Changing it It’s rly interesting I agree But like He might be changing it I wasn’t rlly Paying attention To his descriptions	what do u think about the markup or project A
Ok I’m not going to do a HAHAHHA u can if u want But one internship Is enough for me	ok i agree i'll learn it on my own
HmmmmmMMMMMM this b hard	word bias?
ya sure ?	not sure word bias seems easy to detect and you can only apply it on a word by word basis
HDHASIAOSOZIJAKAO he rlly be calling ppl out HAHHAHAH	ik wtf
Does chrome extension Sound cool Idk	a little but it doesn't require actual nlp just iimplmenetation of the user-based classification math work
ya	let's do word bias 2 actually
Kkkk	love u
	wait actualaly jianna i really don't want to do more vision work
Ok wait then Change	yeah should i go to opinion adjective i'll go there cuz it's the only other one that's strictly nlp
ummm wait is it even nlp??? isn’t it just going through articles and seeing if a list of Adjectives is there	ooh i'm not sure anymore yeah that could be not bueno
Wait that’s what it was	ok yeah i just left it
Last sem burn but it might change	yeah i guess scanning an article for opinionated adjectives is bad yes moneyyyy

u know why HAHAH um	LOL what
i have no diea	cuz like i don't remember anything she's saying rn

i think shes def posting somewhere i just dk where can ask later and lyk	we should have a shared drive yah thanks
thats a v god idea bruh everytime i go onto drive the amount of space i use increases and im like wtf im literlaly not even using it	also emily fucking played me lol she made a new github repo and doesn't even know how to use it
BAHAHAHHAHAHH WAIT I THOUGHT	like i helped her make TWO
SHE DID KNOW HOW TO USE IT	and she like brushed me off
OWEIUROIEWUROWIEUROIUWEIOR	it was ridiculous like i texted her on fb and she was like sorry can we put all urop related communication on slack
bruh	sorry for the misunderstanding i made it already
OIWUROUWEIRUE RWTF	i was like aight fine but i anticipate github related user set up issues so this is not my problem anymore
LMFAO i feel there will be many problems arising OWIEUROIWUER	lol we'll see i'm not doing damage control dude can this meeting be over so i can wash my face
LMFOWIERUOWIEUR Wthis was me during the first ever meeting i think uc an def just	dude i could have

she a big gurl now	holy shit i just swallowed a whole piece of cereal
jamie in her prime	holy shit that was so ba
collins voice reinds me of someone i cant pinpoint hmm this will b bothering me for a while	LOL wait you're right is it just me or does max and meia's relationship feel kind of weird
dude first time i met them together i was kind of lw so wierded out bc SHE WAS SO YOUNG	not just their age gap
AND DI NTO EXPECT THAT but idk	that's already weird
just kinda ignore now bc if theyre into it ig idk if eel like he could be her uncle or something	LOL yeah i also think like max is like controlling and passive aggressive w her
mMMMM wait i agree i think hes kind of just like that as a person lIKE SO PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE and i think that kind of translates into their relationship	wait yeah as a person he's just like that
btw did urop finding funding come out at all or anyting	no did yours
ok links are there and hahahah no but i feel like i should get paid for attending these meetings lmfao bc i could b sleeping	yeah these have to play into our hours for sure if tegmark pays us
but we cant even log in and like i dont want to confront amns about this mans*	i copied in sam's link yeah same
lmfao basically dianbo cannot say no	max is pushing so much
ig this is what it takes to be a professor see im p sure project o is just data collectinlo	a few scripts to process the data whew lol word bias is starting to look like that too tho
ik i think all of the other projects and possibly word is basically data colelction which is basically what i was doing last sem lmfao	RIP
bc ig theres only like sm nlp u can do?? like for the rest	yeah
u just need data mindy is rlly poppin  off wow	tbh i think all these meetings are taking away from valuable working time
i think thats work in general	working in teams always make work slower if u don't have a good project lead
LMFAO but i agree yes agreed i think he kinda just threw project leads into the wolves but im not sure theyre entirely sure what to do sometimes	yeah exactly lol
 Look at this Cute did Dog	OMG do u have a dog now dude whose phone keeps going off
"JAHAHHAHA

its way slower.. like my other one always connected to wifi this one doesn't	Oh huh Weird He's doing a bad job of explaining this
bruh im just confuse about the specifics like i feel like get the overall gist? like just get context and train to find word which he said a lot of times but am confused about how hes implementinglmfao	He's being awfully confusing
lol i feel like based on where this convo is going hes doing all the work?? is there much else to do?? i am confsued	Yeah lol nice I'm probably gonna do some of my own work with the data Once I'm down with my old lab lol
if u do do work can i maybe help u or idk bc am looking at this and like am noodles	LOL Yes Absolutely
THANK YOUUUUU also jamie u should do that	Oh yeah I just saw it I submitted Bit 8 also thought I did that form a while ago
BRUH i totaly forogt bc i was watching avatar OWEIURIOWEURIWEURU	holy jump on now
i did HAHHAHA	did justin text u
HAHAHHA no i got a notification	lol rip
for dev gsd and i was liek fukc	u just missed project updates
oh what ahhh ok are there any for spectacle?? i dont see anything on the nm doc	we're going to assign new tasks today how is admin panel
its like p much done like everything is there and the exportcsv mostly works except for the refresh problem like it only downloads when i presh refresh after i click wait okay so like the admin panel like the buttons don't link to anything except exportcsv fyi	uh wdym buttons don't link to anything also i think we need to figure out teh exportcsv thing probably can't merge that feature in but that's on your branch right also the buttons should link to backend functions
wait yes ok so like theres a button for set timer but i never implemented that and another one for view db's but thats just the main screen so i didn't do anything for that either but for exportcsv yes OH wait so there is a backend function for set timer???	let's just make those your tasks then
omf i did not know that ok	no i don't think there is you'd probably have to write one
ok	i just put u basically on all admin panel stuff
"gothcu BRUH I FOROGT

HAHAAHHAHA	i heard 046 is very math tho holy shit i have to go to the br
ITS MATH NOOOOOO im so bad at math HAHHAHHA	wait idk what other 6 class to take wait rip same me too
i think u should go oh wait there is 031	i heard 031 is kinda cancer tho
i mean	shoudl i take 18.600
u have to take it at one point ummmMM 186600	do u think that helped with probability and combinatorics
i literally just stopped learning after couting i mean i learned a bit but like shit if it was on campus i woudlve failed actually ok not failed	LOL
its not that bad now that i think about it but like more work	i'm into combinatorics but not like
than	any other math is that what it's about holy shit i have to go should i just text in the chat
042 HAHAHHA wait just go hes like in a presentation share screen he cant see you LMFAO ok yes	LOL
that also works	mindy is popping off
wait ik shes working so hard on all of this	lol why tho
im just like wow i rlly like cant bring myslef to i also dont have much to do that i understand	also did your externship dude contact u
LMFAO nope i also	ayeee
have not contacted him	that's what we like to hear
HAHHAAHAH	:DD
what about 034	AI?
or is this a no class i have no idea	usually you just take one or the other
ahh	034 or 036 036 is more like mathematical understandings behind neural nets 034 is applying packages i think to solve general AI tasks
ohhh oki have no idea which is better HAHAHA i think 036 is harder tho ok ya like after 046 and 031 thees nothing much else to take right	033
oh f	then advanced classes
oh shoot	i want to put off 031 tho
i still have to take 004 LMFAO	LOL it's not bad
dude ya 031 sounds	should i switch to a 6-2
awful' HAHHAHHA I GENUIENLY THOUGHT	yeah rip
YOU MIGHT DECLARE 6-2	i declared 6-3 but that's just cuz i don't know if i like hardware enough to take like 3 more classes in it
ya u.  r right	should i double in econ or finance
dude yes i think finance might be hard bc it also has so many requirement	yeah
but econ is def doable	i know that's the tough part
if you are interested	idk if i am but i feel like i should explore smth
like what would it help u w in the real world?? ya i also feel that	a finance degree? like knowledge of money haha
no like econ degree HHAHHA i thin	i have no context
finance degree would b helpful maybe i want to take	oh neither of them would be useful
a class in sloan just to see what its like HAHAHHA	ahah same allen told me he declared 15
maybe course 9?? OH WAHT WHAT	so he could get a 15 advisor
FOR THE BACKPACKA??	LOWKEY yeah
oh bruh wait why is a 15 adviosr better	i think he just wants to see what it's like and join the sloan community
dam	lowkey i'm gonna declare 15 for the same reason
WAIT ACTUALLY	after your third semester you can declare a double
LIKE YOURE GIONGTO CHANGE OHHHHHHH	so i'm gonna declare a 15-3 without any 15-3 classes lmfao i decided business analytics is not it
HAHAHAHHAHAH	since it's just data science and ML so i'm over it
wait yes it is just data science and mL lmao but like i feel ike its the easy way out to joining sloan community HAHHA	haha yeah but i should learn some new content
ya u r right	that's not aligned with what i currently do
ya like i also want to explore new things like i srsly feel u so hard but i simply dont know	"IT""S SO hard but since i took like 3 6 classes last term i just think i could afford only taking 046 nex t term and take like 14.01 and a 15 class and smth else"
yesi def thin u can ait if u take a 15 class i am also down to try w u but also	YESSSS
i feel like u have to start with 15401 or 501 right	oh i should take an 18 or 8 class
thats like basics to something dude i rlly want to try 8.33 or 8.03	oh those r like accounting right
dude	that's quantum right or waves
ummm 8.03 is waves i think 8.33 is epcial relativity i think i am also so not sure	ohhhh
but i also think	i'm down to take an 8 class w u
"it would kill me OHHHHHH OK 
BET"	esp if we're online and/or p/nr
ok yes i agree	i'll just take like 7 classes
ngl i kinda like online	LOL
sad i cant see people but like i can do so much more tings	yeah rip but it makes your life more flexible
ya ur so right	not that we have anything to do
wait ya but 401 and 501 i think are like basics to accounting and ifnance that are like prereqs?? bruh i hate	i'll do basics to finance then
prereqs	yeah
oh i head 14.32	same
might also be good idk tho	what's that
its like econometrics??? im not sure what that means but sunds cool?	h yeah i did hear good things about that
oh shit i may take that but also my friend said she spent like 14 hours	that has prereqs tho
on that class wait no	FFF
14.3 or whatever the prereq is is like not necessary just like ap stats	oh really? ok nice
thats what my friend said so i believe not neessrry hm dude i just want to try so many thkngs but also like i dont have room to i dont think i hav eno idea	you're trolling there is a prereq
wait it is ia prereq but u can take wihtout like	oh really?
ya like my friend took it wo?	oh huh that's good maybe let's just go for it i have to take 14.01 tho
ok wait yes i am so down ohHHH i am debating	AHAH
whether to take 14.01 like	have u taken 14.01 tho
idk if it would help me at all like i took macro? also their psets dont seem ery interesting seems like a lot of work so idk	yeah rip but it's an econ prereq
I KNOWWWWWWWW OWIEUROWIUROIWEr	yeah pset class
OIWUREOWUEIRUWer wiait where do we find this jupyter notebook did he not share yet or	it's in the tutorials repo on tegmark research group
yuyup i see ty	god i have so many problems with the way that team is set up yee
BAHHAHHA what would u change	first of alll i just don't like the random capitalization and it's on the mit domain so meh wow i didn't catch anything in his tutorial
BAHHAHHA i was eating i like caught the part where jupyter notebook on github oh yes i also do not lke how its on mit domain grrrrrr	lol i like never use jupyter so getting that setup to work with my virtualenv was all i've been doing
 also wait i need virtualenv? to use jupyter notebook?	no i just wanted to because otherwise my system gets junked up with all these dependencies lol is that new
"yuppppp tbh it REMINDS ME OF ANOTHER SONG I LITERALLY CANT PINPOTIN
like the chorus where shes just talking it sounds exactly like another song not my fav but decent"	i'll give it a listen now

"JAMIE DID THEY GO OVER ANYTHIGN IMPORTANT INT HE MEETING FUCK
I FOROGT AGAIN DUDE THIS IS WHY IF I DONT HAVE NOTIFICATIONS I WOULDDIE I WENT TO PLAY TENNIS INSTEAD OWEIUROUWEIRUWIOEUR"	Uh I didn't go
LFMAO	I'm like not officially working yet
WE ARE BOTH RLLY	So all meetings are useless to me
oIUWIEORre YA U RIGHRT	LOL
"BRUH I CKEEP ON 
FRGOETTING TO GO OWIERUOWIEURIOWER"	My excuse anhwahs Why didn't they notify u
IDK IDK IDK SLACK JUST DOESNT NOTIFY ME AND NO ONE TEXTED ME LIKENADIA ALWAYS TEXTS ME FOR CR WHICH IM SO GALD OTHERWISE I WOULD LITERLALY NEVER GO OWEUROIWEUR	Aye Lol Rip
daily life of jianna liu rip dude omfg wait like there so many people protesting floyds death rn in california near where i live and theyre like blocking the highways aAND LIKE hammering at peoples cars windows bruh i was wgoing to go down to that city tomorrow bUT NOW IM TOO SCARED	Oh shit wow Yeah I mean what r they gonna do about it from cali tho
wait jamie is this what machine learning training is always like? like input layer another embedding layer and a dense layer? i remmeber someone saying hidden layer before? is that what the other layers below the input layer is? and bruh i have no idea what theyre going to from cali lmfao	"not always but basically the idea is that you go from some input through a set of layers and different types of layers have different functions and then your output is the type of output you need and the idea is that the machine ""learns"" how to produce an output given some input by setting each layer's ""weights"" properly"
Okok gotchu So there can be any number of layers? Like there’s no standard?	yes different architectures have different structures for layers as well typically it goes like this for images tho your input will be some 2d image then you'll apply some convolutional layer with some # of filters to it then you'll apply a max pooling layer to reduce the complexity of the output then you'll apply some nonlinearity function typically this is ReLU and you can repeat as many times as you want and once you want your output you'll usually have some fully connected layer + a linear layer to receive output. if you're bounding by some probability with classification you'll use softmax or sigmoid at the end as well nonlinearity functions are to add dimensional complexity to your model otherwise your model is only as good as linear transformation
ohhhhh I see ok gotchu tyyyyy hehhehehe	Yee
lmfaoi also added a timer its kinda in wrong position but ya so like if timer is 0 what should happen?? sohuld the submit	LMAO
button disappear??	I assigned Julia the task to make the submit button go away after the deadline has passed
oho k beautifl sorry where do i see my specific task again	You just need to be able to set it on the backend Notion And go/spectacle-timeline Also your reload to download CSV thing is really wonky lol
ikkkkkk f sad so wonkkkkyyy ok also when you say submit button in backend i only need to keep track of how much time is left right? and based on that julia can do her thing with the submit button?	Wdym by submit button in backend
idk so currently i only have a frontend thing but you said i have to set it on the backend so there do u mean just like keeping track of how much time is left	Set the deadline in the backend Apparently there's something written for that already Btw can u move admin to its own page So instead of as a dropdown It's like an a button to access the admin page
ohh ok	Then there's a place u can edit settinga
ya i can do that	And when u hit save changes
and for this Apparently there's something written for that already	It sends an update to the back end settings endpoint
do u mean in gavel?	In spectacle A settings enpoint
this?	Yep
oh wait so then itis already written??	Yeah you can use the existing endpoint if u want If it's easy for u to manipulate 9n the frontend The way I envision there's some section on the admin panel Where u can set and change these things And when u hit save changes it just sends the results from those values to this endpoint
ohh i see so like someone can input a hard and soft deadline in like a box lets say and then like the frontend timer like changes its value based on this time and then when i hit save changes its like a post request to this endpoint and then	Yes
julia does the rest from there ok ok also i am not entirely done debugging the exportcsv ive changed it to its own page and stuff but im going to push bc i need to update my computer hopefully that is okay? liek just to my local branch	do u mean admin panel sure i can take a look from your branch
ok i pushed wait can u see if it worked before i restart like how d i check? if it pushed correctly?? lmfao	just check the github repo go/spectacle
but its a pull request?? like it says compare and pull request	um why did u amek a PR lol
wait i didn't i did git push and thats what it is on the repo ???	uh yeah why r u under the PR header tho just go to code and change branches
OMG did not know ok great so its like there but not a pr?!??!	LOL dude ok
wow i did not know that was a thing okay thats why i kept on making prs bc i didn't think uc oudl see it wow ok awesome	anything u put on the remote repo i can pull and test on my own computer haha did u rebuild and test
Oh I did bon Mom Install Npm Does that not Wait yes I rebuilt That’s so weird That the file didn’t come w Oh I think it’s bc	uh yeah i just added it to the package.json
Ok woops I don’t t  hi no I added Think I added That file	here's my test run idk why but the back button doesn't take me back to app.js and the sidebar is all wonky lol if you could leave the format like spectacle header at the top that links back to home that would be good too
Ok let me check when I get back ty v much hehhehe ya ok thats how its supposed to look like rn LOL wait so do u not want the sidebar to look like that i just didn't know how to design it so i just left it like that ok and will add the functionality that it will go back to home	oh like as a settings page like you can see what settings you currently have and then there are options to change them like an edit button
do you mean a settings page like that	sort of let me find something something like this where your info is displayed and then u hit edit and u can change it
ohhhhhhhhh i see JAMIE I GOT THE DONWLOAD TO WORK OWIUEROWUROIUWEOIRU YIPEEEEE ok i will now fix frontend ok	YAY amazing jianna
lmfao are we just not presenting our own articles is it just hw presentation now i am totally okay w this	LOL yessss we love it
waht group do u prefer hahhahha	Haha second Understanding other people's code is hard For react components do u usually do like a lot of HTML or do u use like ui frameworks
i suually use ui frameworks i dont rlly know html tbh i never properly learned so i think thats why i kind of struggle a bit with formatting things	Hmm OK have u ever run into the issue where your components overlap
wdym?? like what ?? i dont think so? they usually stay out of the way of each other? bc each component returns a piece right	Like I have a component with a nav bar div And then I have some switch with routws Each with their own component But they overlap? Like the nav bar
um wait can u send me pic and code liie ap ic of code and pic of what it looks like	Yeah I'm in the br rn but will do Thanks
"yaaaaa:)
]\\"	ok so this is what it looks like and i tried the render and component and just using it as children but i get like this sort of effect wow nvm i'm dumb i fixed it
ok also sorry for late response its just i saw that you texted me and i was literally goingto respond but then you fixed it so i was like ok go jamie and then didn't respond but again go jamie u rock	lol it's good thanks what does n1 and n2 mean jianna
i think one means like left word other means right leaning words	oh is that on mediacloud
wait no she like went through articles on tor i used medicaloud tho bc coronavirus didn't happen between 2017-2019 dude also side note ive fucking perfected banana bread	LOL
its so good im	were articles classified as n1 and n2 tho i'm proud of u or did she manually label them
hope nope they were ot HAHHAHHA manually label	oh so in the articles n1 and n2 were lableled
like manualy find the words that correspond to n1 and n2 and then go through all the news sources and then calculate n1 and n2	oh wdym by calculate n1 and n2
like find the number of articles that have the words that correspond to n1 and n2	oh why # of articles
so then you can find a ratio like n1/n2	oh i see for each of the sources where are you getting the ground truths for the data again like what is arun testing on the nyt corpus pickle file
wait i have no idea i think probably nyt ?? corpus pickle?	hmm and then is he just running like tf-idf data to make predictions it's not a nn right
not not nn i think	oh ok cool
hes just runing tf-idf the one haimoshri	ah i see
wrote	i see that's fantastic lol
wait why AHAAH	idk i was just ffeling a bit behind
same	so i just wnat to make sure i'm caught up
fam i hfeel like i havent done anything BC I DONT KNOW	i haven't been doing much
WHAT TO DO	i haven't done anything lol did u not start your job
i did but its like not much work at all	yeah yesterday i was like i'm not going to do any lab work so i just tried to make a react app
at least rn like they mostly do it themselves andi just kinda sit here and ya	LOL nice
omfg queen	yeah not really i'm trying not to use any ui frameworks so it's just fanagled html
wait what why are you not trying to use ui frameworks then its just html and css ???	they look like pretty canned a lot of the content is static so i'm trying to use react stuff but not like semantic or material
should i volunteer i feel bad for this islence	LOL
wait wtf semantic or materila is litearlly react???!?! i fee like??!??!	oh huh idk it feels like very dependent to use all this stuff on top of react i'm trying to use it rn to compartmentalize stuff but like i realized halfway through i don't need react to do this so maybe i'll try to use some more stuff later idk
wait ya i think i depend to much on it bc i dont actually know anything else lmfoa	LOL it's alright knowing more is better
lw so glad were not on project o	lol dodged a bullet there
this meeting is > 1 hr long *angry face* dude that would be so cool to publish a paper wow	haha i've tried before but publishing is really hard
oh rllyyy	like at my last summer research program
ohh is the goal there to publish a paper	but like my advisor was like this isn't deep enough and wouldn't submit it no depends on your advisors
ohhhhh i feel like what were doing so far i dont know what we would publish lmfao	yeah same i also haven't done anything so
HAHHAHA sam e	ugh using react for this website was such overkill
wait why i think react is bueno	it's such overkill you can't even host dynamic sites on github pages F and i'm not advanced enough to build a node server so f again
wait can u buy ur own domain	yeah what's the status on admin panel
um i def think i can do itbut i just haven done much yet solike i will spend more time on it Wait jamie The phone number is me Can u tell Justin that	ok lol i'm joining now
wait i totaly missed all this for hack penguin ist his like an al dev project? why are there so few tasks lol wait jamie how many students did we decide to accept into hackmit this yr or like are going to and wait lmfao is hackmit happpening on 9/19-20 this year	E haven't decided yet More than usual tho for sure And it's 18 to 20
ok got it t ty	He says he'll have more bur He's also probably doing it mostly by himself
ya lolz	Omg rip I said I was gonna do shit today for my uropa But I didn't omgggg What do I do
lmfao this is a mood i just dont evne know where to start	How was your work meeting Wah it's up I was waiting for the netlify nameservers to kick in But the front-end only version of the website is up Theres not that much content on it yet but Yeee jamiefu.me Also I need to fix the mobile version ugh
OMG LOOKS SO AESTHETIC HAHHA my work meeting was boring as always	Ahaha the menu bar was all copy paste
LOOK SSO GOOOOD now u can put this link in ur ig bio like the cool kidz	AHAHA My medium is in my ig bio rn But I'm trying to embed my feed onto the writing tab That took me a long time to research yesterday but I might try that next I wanted to make doing & dones also cards But it's rough going so far I just figured out the postgres database but dunno how to do the server calls F
ohhhhh taht so coollll you can do like axios.get()??	Yeah that'll be the front-end calls to the node server I'll have to use the server to make calls to the db F shouldve just used flask
lol what are u using instead hHAHAHA dude u know how i spilled water on my old computer it suddenly opened today so now i ahve two computers and im confused	omg your old laptop was messed up tho
BAHHHAHA u right 9am wait what is this for im confused	good morning calls like your bf

like jijivlogs	hmm my gut feeling is that if i saw it surrounded by a lot of other stories i would be like ??? but also i'm not sure there's definitely people on snapchat rn living their lives on their main too huh
wati ya ik like surrounded by a bunch of black screen s this video would be like what	how many people on on jijisvlogs
um like 60 lol	"ok like here's the thing my friends and i don't always talk about current news and stuff like this when we dm that would be kind of strange what if u just like sent it to the people you wanted to see it like personally cuz i feel like the tone of that is more like ""offline"""
"ahhh ok wait the thing is like i just wanted it to be there not for people to see but just a place for me to remember my progress so maybe i should just remove everyone from that account
LFMAO OWEIUROWEURIOUW"	OH i see
or maybe i will jsut wait idk	so like you want to save it on sc can't u do that without posting it i'm p sure you might have to wait a whiole
rip ok ya makes snese wait sc??	yeah you can save on sc just open the video and like hit the save button right i'm not actually sure
ohh	since like i haven't been on for a while
LOLz	I FORGOT THERE WAS A MEETING NOW
OH WAIT i thought u left this project which is why i didn't text u LOL	damn i did not leave i've just been assigned no work
WAIT YA THATS WHY I THOUGHT U LEFT OWEIRUOWEIURIEUWR HAHHAHHA ok now i know	LOLLLL
will remind u NEXT TIME LMFAO	they didn't assign me any work the first time cuz like i wasn't started yet right so i didn't attend any project meetings what have u been up to today
LMFAO i danced	ayee can u send me the video at least
bc i have nothing else to do	i want to see it
LOL OKAY HAHHAHHA	i'm an avid follower of your ig
wbu HAHHAHAH	hair flip and cat ears were fireeee the music paired with the picture at the end i can see why u didn't post it
yaaaaa	but the dance is so hardddd how did u do that
WAIT WHAT that has been my easiest one i think the harder ones for me	WAIT WHAT
are the groovy ones bc i cannot groove	maybe i'm just bad there were so many movements damn
like fast sharp dances are easier? for me? personally?	i think u got the groove tho
HAHHAHAH F I LOOK SO BAD in THAT VIDEO IT CRINGES FOR ME TO LOOKA T IT	the facial expressions are so good i've been reading up on how to link word2vec models to neural nets cuz i think im just gonna try that on my own
WOEIUROWIEUROUEWORU THANKS JAMIE  ohhhh WAIT IF YOU DO UR OWN CAN I HELP YOU bc i also have nothing to do on this project	Yeah I'm not sure I feel like I don't have very many tasks to do rn that aren't tedious or using someone else's code that i don't think is useful Yeah totally I think we should try to brainstorm some architectures and how to represent the daya
OK yES we should do this independelty i agree wait i onestl have no idea what everyone is doing like it seems that every project is so tedious except possibly project c but idk what arun and colin are doing and sam seems to be doing good but project w just seems tedious but may be better idk	^we didn't define a good objective So it seems like we're just fishing around We need to collect crowdsourced data for that too probably Like how extreme is this word When describing a democrat Or how extreme is this word When describing Covid-19
Wait ya I just like don’t feel myself learning anything So like I don’t feel very invested in anything lol	Let's get motivated together!
snoujld we make our own github together LOL also jamie ummmmmmmmmMMMM i think imma just post bc its only my friends also WTF im wearing the same exact clothes as the last video ew	LOL wait no yeah i was going through sc and there's very little related content it's your private too so should be ok LOL yes  really simply NLP model with like 3 layers pytorch has lots of great built in layers
ok let me read this ty	it's for classifying parts of speech tho
ok wait you know what khaled was saying with spacy how like	i need to read more about how to classify many to one
those already clasissyf nouns/adjectives	yeah
is that what you mean by parts of speech	yeah basically like noun determinant verb
wait many to one didn't haimoshri say onevsclassifer	uh what
oops this thing  ok im reading this and i think im going to give myself a tutorial on pytorch first LOL	oh yeah i saw that but isn't that just used to process data haha good idea
ok after reading the thing u sent me im not sure if my thoughts are correct but based on like what ive read before and this like pytorch already has built in optimization/loss functions that we just call right all we have to do is prepare the data? i think what i don't get is why the matrix at the end has 3 columns but im assuming they're taking the maximum for the highest correlation? and when they say pass an LSTM over the sentence i have no idea if what im assuming is true but im assuming its just the model they are creating using the functionalities built in to nn?	LOL yes will explain more in a bit i'm in a call rn
"dude u r a ok im just reading more bc lw interesting but this is a thing called rnn which is LIKE RECURRENCE??!?!
buT ILIKE NEURAL NET ?!?!? wow extensive"	Yes its recurrent yay i'm so glad
HAHHAHHA BUT THE THING is i can't tell if i m simplfying the concept of neural network too much like is it literally just inputs which we usually format into an n dim array or something apply some functions to it to output something and get the output like is the hard part the functions LOL also just ignore me while u r in ur cal lol	LOL it's not too difficult tho really
naie there is a messenger c meeting	DID I MKSS IT
Yup	Shit I slept at like almost 5 last night
bruh wtf	What happened
nothing	What did I miss
its ok u didn't miss anything it was just emily	What did they talk about
trying tou nderstand tf-idf and then ileft	Oh whew r u joining meeting rn
I’m joining Late	LOL
Don’t text me too wait bc I’m sharing screen Rn	OK .... , , , . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . .
LMFAO dude This lady be calling me and Then Ben and milo Started testing and I was like Fuck Bc I get the notifs on messenger but I am smart And closed the app hehehhe Jk I’m so dumb MMFLQLSOPA	holy you can also just put your mac on like silent mode
dude ik I’m so dumb	what's up oh still in meeting?
hulo i am back HAHHAHAHH hulo i am back HAHHAHA	hey there friendo 
lolz dis b me	word wait i'm confused what is the goal of project w
i was literaly just ging to ask u	what is the word ratio thing she's asking us to find LOL
wait so word ratio what i thought was like ranking articles based on how or not articles news osurces based on how binased they were like n1 would be super left/right words and n2 would be the opposite side and u rank like each news source but idk what the goal is	i thought it was just extreme / normal
like of the overall project or ya	and like how would we find those numbers
ig theyre saying left is normal kinda	with which sources
lol shes just using mediacloud rn???? like	how do u do that
wait like just type in the word and search with what news source you want to use and run it through all the articles??	but that means our data isn't like uniform
yup so im confused shoudl we ask in the projectw slack lol bc	where do u get the numbers of articles that they appear
i am confused as well	yeah we should do u want to send it
lol sure	thanks boo holy shit is this linalg
i think so eigen	fuck
i heard this in 18600 once when evan vogelaumasked some weird quesiton lol	LOL strange happenings wow i heard nothing in the past 10 minutes i wasn't even trying not to pay attention
:OL same literally same	LOL Is this sam Yeah I agree Max os Too chaotic He's too result hungey
idk i said this i think ya hes rly result hungry ig a lot of professors are lol?? but ya i just want to know what he like wants us to do wthi sfreaking project LOL	LOL I KNOW Yeah we'd both join Idek what PCA is
i think its principla component analysis or something like that	I know but like At is that Also do u know what the difference is between the nyt corpus and the news folder data
i think somehow like something about changing the data to minizmize it but now change the ratio or something something like that not sure news folder is like i believe all the articles from a bunch of news soruces nyt corpurs is just new york time s	do they all follow the same classification tags lilke topic classification tags
no like other articles aren't tagged w nyt tags	what are they tagged with then
um not sure entirely i can't rlly remmeber	LOL f are they tagged at all
i think they might be?? i hoenstly am not sure i didn't rlly work with those	lol so arun must be running on the nyt corpus data
i think so this is what sam said	i think we need to collect a lot of potentially large words biased* large collection of it
but like if we colelct it is there not bias in this bc we might miss some like	"we don't have to rank them we'll ask mturk users to rate their ""extremity"" and that's the training data that would be really fantastic becuase rn we're making judgements on what is extreme"
right so like okay ya mturk is technically like a bunch of ppl	also i think we need to spec out the design of this project some more as well as C all of the projects we're on are SO chaotic
wait i think its bc noone knows what theyre doing and max isnt helping much LMFAO OIWRUEOIWUER ya wait i think a zoom cal w max about project w would actually be very helpful	yeah or maybe just on our own because all he does is confuse us
ya i agree jamie ur my lifesaver	LOL
ur project w and c's lifesaver as well	LOL i haven't done anything i'm just thinking
ya but thats more than the other ppl LOL	omg thansk bb lol i'm kind of ignoring my other urop rn so that's kind of how my life is going
HAHHAHHAHAH ur othe rurop where ur ml is worse than guessing HAHHAHA did u improve it at all or is it still jsut guessing LOL	i haven't tried it all recently
LMFAO i love this for u	cuz i sent an email earlier this week and he responded but i ignored him for like almost 2 days and i just responded today so i'm just gonna wait for him to get back to me he also said he could look at my code which i'm really thankful for are you skipping the mturk meeting
ah fck is that rn fuck HAHHAHHA	yes lol i haven't been paying attention it's just logistics
ok i have started to pay attention LOL	i have been listening in the back of my noggin noggin
HHAHAHn noggin wait but isn't max funding it so we can't just log 8 hours everyday?	he is but you can since you work like 8 hours a day right the meeting is part of it and then you do work on your own and like it's a hassle to log different hours a day he can't tell anyways + he probably doesn't care enough to check
ummMM i might log 8 hours on weekend but LOL ok i see what u mean holy what are u in the meeting faculty rate students to get into mit	Wait Hat meeting I left early SERIOUSLY?
i have realized hahaha	I thought it was AOs Not fqculty
wait me too but he was talking about mturk and was talking about ratings and was like	Wait ehy
ya when faculty rate students who get into mit bla ha blah i was like oh wtf oh bc i told him i wouldnt work full time LOL so would seem weird bc its his $	Oh yeah u probably can't log full hoirs Maybe he meant AO faculty Or grad students That seems more plausible where can i find the key for company labels
umm what???	the company labels are are like 910939i whatever
i didn't know there were any? wait for nyt corpus?	is this tagrules for nytcorpus yeah
i think theyre are in tagrules but tagrules also has a bunch of random countries i think its another file i think csv_comparison maybe in nyt_corpus	wait no it doesn't? also there's no csv comparison file there's tag comparison but it's still loading oh i see what do these mean
ok wait sorry which one do you have a questio about??	what the values in the tags correspond to i think i got it tho it's just the mappings in tagruls
ok ya likeall are mapped in tagrules just it also has some ectra ones like country names ihtink dude jamie i got a monitor and it kind of is lifechanging hello just a question is there a place where u found useful or like hleped u better understand machine learning /pytorch if ther eisn't its ok i will just continue to watch these youtube vids lol	Wowow Oh huh Like the official pytorch tutorials are not bad Or there's like a Google crash course Or coursera Stanford Andrew Ng's class hey u coming today
TYYY and yes fam My stopped Zoom Stoopid	LOL tegmark asked me to ask u
f	LOL busy gorol
hi jamie also ik am not very expeirenced w nlp but if u need help or i can help u w lmk hehe i just genuinely have no idea what i am doing but will try my best LMFOA also wow i did not know jack did nlp thats kinda cool	haha yeahhhh thanks bb oh yeah howd u hear he's at the new york times
thats literally so freaking cool it was bc i was doing spectacle and then i saw one of his commits andin his bio on github it was like doing nlp at nyt and i was likeahhh	LOL very nice
"Holy shit  Search up Colin tang imo Holy fuck Dam Omfg I’m aps
Hook So shook"	Oh yeah isn't he really good at math
dude ya	Also haimo decided to just casually implement the network I wanted to do
wait ya i saw the text i was like wasnt that the thing jamie lol	But I looked at her code yesterday and I think the preprocessing is wrong
ohhh but i dont think thats. big pobrlm right? like she said it only wokrs if in csv format or something idk	Well no I saw how she was processing that too But the labels look just like 1 through 594 in a list Wait idk will u take a look sometime and tell me
yupp	Lol OK so her labels aren't wrong But her input is kind of strange
ok wow i am attempting o understand her code wow	Haha yeah I just texted her about it She texted me just now to the me shed implemented it So I was like uh
ok jamie idk if this is what u want for spectacle but like ignore the table that says set timer but i have three buttons? and then when i press set timer a form will pop up where you can edit start and end time and when they press submit that will changes the values in the backend does that look okay or do u want soething else its totally ok if u want something else just like i was trying to make the image u sent me but like i got kind of confused lol but i can def do that jujst more work justlmk	Wait uh As long as I can see the current deadline And edit it to set a new one that propagates back Then it's fine I can't really tell from the video u sent me Like I should be able to see all the information on one page ideally And for the setting Like deadline I should have an option to change it And submit a form
ok ya i htink im done then let me send u a video and let me know if i should push?	Yessss Thank u jianna
hahah yup so there is no backend for this tho bc i am assuming julia is doing it?? oh wait sHOOT i have not done	Wait no there is
the view dbs button what is this button oh wait so shoul di connect to backend	Yes
i cam confused again ok i will do that	Haha
wait also my view dbs button doesn't do anything woops i am not done what is this thing for??	LOL what What thing
the view dbs button thingy like what am i supposed to show??	The databases content Like except for settings Show the projects and users db
oh ok ill figure that out latedr	Yeah hahaha
just to say i rlly don't like semantic ui i think it looks kinda ugly but text is kinda very aesthetic but ik justin and jack	LOL
very much like it	U can write it with just HTML elements If u prefer that
no i h8 that HAHHAHAHAA	It'd be mostly CSS for positioning LOL
i think tahts why i dont like this bc semantic ui allows u to just write in html so all the documnetation is just html and im lke BUT I DONT WANT TO USE HTML	LOL Wdym The ui frameworks arejust All the components are good HTML stuf
wait sorry i lost my train of thought lol ok looking at backend so you want the admin to be able to input 3 things?? like soft and hard deadline? and is open time just like the current time or should th eperosn also be able to input that as well bc rn i only have one place form for deadline LOL	Not the current time for open Should be custom for all 3 fielda
ok got it kk beunoe also it says its uspoeod to be ints so i will just assum theyre putting in a number??	What says Those must be the db table specs Do u know how to change it U can change them into date time SQL 9bjects instead If that's preferable
Okok	i muted u idk what noises u were making lol
oh What Woops I am sorry I was taking a walk Ty Very mucho lol	OMG lol jianna why r u laughing
oh i was saying that i will	i'm calling u out now
get a tiktok i think	LOL do it
AHAHHAHAHHA i did not know i could be seen dude that danile sun guy kinda looks like victor does he not	like your victor?
AHAH zbt victor DOESNT HE IS WEAR HE DOES	WAIT no idek what he looks like tho
let me find pic literally the same hi also idk if this is the best time to ask but um how do ia ccess the database lol	LOL uh
if u dont know	psql
i will ask justin bc	i think
ive done it before i just cant rmemeber OIEURIOWER	he knows for sure
ok got it psql will do ty	heroku psql ugh i can't remember
ohhh heroku i vaguely vageluy remmeber this sad when justin still doesn't respond to you	LOL rip
dude tiktok is so confusing i dont get it	wait is it i actually don't know anything about it at all also i've been trying to fix my lstm code like all evening but i'm still getting errors therefore i give up
LMFAO i am still learning about neural networks after i saw the first 10 lines of haimoshris code i was like wtf dood im so confused by ti kt ok	LOL well now we're both just confused ugh she really did this to me
OWIEUOIWEUR	now i have to work harder for this stupid lab than i want to
bc of her? its ok i am still here	LOL let me know if u need help with anything
BHAHAHHHA i think i am at a point where i dont know what i need help w HAHHAHAHA but i am glad max doesnt have that high expecations of me so i can just slowly learn lmfao and then	u really just gotta take time with these things anyways if u wanna brainstorm with me my problem right now is that my model is starting training but stopping almost immediately due to a floating point exception which i have no idea how to fix but presumably the backprop is getting divide by zero errors
wait im literally very sorry but i have no diea what u mean like i have nt gotten to the training part yet and idk what backprpop wait so what i know of training is just like having a dataset and you run ur code on that right is this dumb can u like print out when there is an error and like what number gives you that error oh hes talking about training now i willl get back to u lol	LOL ok
idk but are you putting an empty tensor idk what thi smenas but i think other ppl did that and had issues also so random but i just found out about katsuobushi theyre fukcing lfakes that move but not alive i was so shook	yeah i totally thought ii wasn't but it turns out i was i saw that when i looked it up too
ok i am glad that is fixed lol	but i didn't think to ocheck lol i shouldn't save bad data like that lol
HAHHAHHAHAH	f whatever i'm too lazy oh shit i got it to run accuracy is probably shit but whatever i'm over it it ran so i can say i did it and that's all you'll be hearing from me
YAYYAYYAY	"yeah i always get stuck on this ""accuracy"" part tho so idk what to do about this"
like ur result??	yes like the result is never good haha
i mean better than guessing right HAHHAHHA thatwhoping fat 25%	lol what
idk ur other urop	oh yeah that was like 48% which happens to be worse than guessing
man still hasn tresponded SAD	just bump him he probably forgot
ok hahha	JIANNA why is your false positive rate over 100% 1.663
wait i think its like number of tags im not sure i was kind of confused too but all the other ones seem to also have > 1 ?? oh lol i se whatu mean i think idk	uh
tbh	yeah LOL
i def just didnt divide	also i got my model to run
by something. it hink but idk what theyre dividng by lol	lol false positive is FP / (FP + TN)
ohhh	i think i'm about to one up yall
thats beutiful pls b number 1	here's the calculations btw haimo could beat me idk my stuff is random at least it works lol
thats amazing so good i love this for u	anyways i ran it on every 1000th point in the dataset and i got almost 0 false positive and about .71 false negative
wooohooo SO GOOD	LOL i'm trying to run it on the full dataset but it's massive
ya	so it's taking a really long time to preprocess
shes quite thic	it's cuz error can be easily lowered by guessing all 0's fallse positive i mean and false positive becuase the loss function weights 0's and 1's equally and the dataset labels are quite sparse so oh i just realized why it's so slow
ls oops	i was running it on matlaber yesterday
sorry my b HHAHAHA	and euler doesn't have CPUs
isn't matlab super slow	wait idk why it's called matlaber but it has nothing to do with matlab matlaber is the mit media lab machines they have 12 of them and there's like 8 GPUs on each one
wait jamie for spectacle backend do u want date and time or just time bc its technically all on the same date right?	We might want it up before judging date So if u could put date that would be great Like we'll want to test it beforehand and deploy iy
wait JAMIEEEEEE I THINK IT WORKS SO DOES JULIA NOW DO THE REST i also need to create a frontend for this right??? or no????	haha basically your task is to finish the admin panel julia will make the edits to submission page and not allow users to submit / edit projects after project deadline you just need to make sure u can properly set the deadline
ok okokokok got it i think it can properly set deadline do u want a f rontend w it??? or is this ok like just a form and then input times	well i thought u already built the frontend for setting the deadline? if not then yes
wait like	like you should input a date and time
frontend as in like	on the admin panel
no like i have that	oh
but do u want like a cool countdown timer thing or is this ok LOL	OH no timer necessary but it'd be nice to have a small bar at the top with the desdline
ahh ok i will do that after i finish view dbs ok gotchu	YAY
also god bles whoever wrote the backend for update setings lOL	LOL jason i think that man wrote the whole framework for this app took me forever to understand and i'm still not completely confident
LOL wait i have a question jsut to clairfy so im in this new branch jianna/timer so if i do git push --set-upstream origin jianna/timer do i make a pull request ro no or no** jason rlly belegendary wait jamei sorry for so many questions but like for projects do u want me to show it in like a card format?? bc isn't that already shown on the main spectacle page??	this pushes jianna/timer to a remote branch called jianna/timer by setting the origin branch u don't make a pr u just send your recent work tot hat brnach the time? deadline?
ok so i should just do	no u can just make it a small div or element on the menu bar
git push --set-upstream origin jianna/timer and it will be fine ok wait no for	what will be fine
view dbs	oh can u make them tables i'm sure semantic has some pretty rendering for that if not u can also use html tables
like i do that command and it will be on git? so no pr?	"so i think your terminology is kind of off LOL so i think i understand but let me clarify git push tells git to ""push"" all your recent commits on the current branch to the remote branch associated with your local one. when you say ""set-upstream-branch origin"" you are telling git that your current local branch should ""track"" the remote branch you specify"
ah ok so then it will be on git remote ok got it	for PRs i think that's a separate github feature not specifyc associated with git
idk i feel like at work they just always make me do a pr??	it will be on your remote repo
do i get confused LOL so*	git is a version control management tool github has nothing to do with git
OH	it just uses git to manage projects across remote machines
INTERESTING okay	you could also use like microsoft's verison of it or like bitbucket but github is most popular
also this is off topic but do u want like user and project tables to be two separate tables LOL bc user table in the database is just users??? or just one project table	PRs are made for code reviews
LOL ok i see this this makes much more sense	preferably two because then u can track all users and all projects
ok so one for all the users one fo r all the projects	yep
i gotchu wait so should i make a pr sosomeone can review my code for timer or just leave my. branch as it is and someone can look later	sorry what exactly is your code for the timer because i thought we decided not to do a timer anymore so i'm very confused
wait its just adding a form and cahnging the model to be DateTime form and adding a post request from the values in the form	ah from the admin panel? ok i see
yes from admin panel	are u continuing to work on that branch for view dbs
um i can create a new branch or not	no u can keep it on there
ok	and make the PR for all of it at the end after u test it
ok gotchu	ok so evidently 2 million data points will take a long time F i haven't even gotten through the first epoch
dammmm	:/
ok i finished spectacle i think btw so ima just make a pr???	oh wowwww you've been working hard all weekend um yeah make a pr i'll pull your branch and test it as well excited to see it
HHAHAHHA ya sure whenver u need to i made a pr	oh yep i saw it mb
Colin is so savage	yeah wtf LOL also i made it through two epochs F
Bruh	all of yesterday two epochs great
Dam this is what Arun Has to do LMDAO Lmfao**	lol dude haimo fucking turned arun into her code monkey why does she get to tell arun waht to do and to run his code i asked her and she doesn't even run her code on euler which means she has access to GPUs if she makes arun run them then he doesn't have access to GPUs and it goes significantly sllower
dam i asked haimoshri a question once and she is very not helpful in answering LMFAO	wait yeah literally i think that's so annoying the point of working in a lab is that you need to help each other
dude ik shes apparently also a 009 la imagine having her debugging ur code i think she would bg ood but would look at it for like 2 seconds and be like	oh wait what year is she
junior ????	oh that's new i definitely did not get junior vibes from her i literally can't
LMFAO IM DEAD IMDEAD THATS SO OWERUOWEIRUWIEOR why is this literally the funie stconversation ever im DEAD	there's more above this too My wifi is down tell max if he looks for me
yessir	what's your emotional oranges video i saw it when u were sharing
oh lmfao its a husffling dance track	what is husfflign
shuffling**	oh LMAO fun
so hard my calves be exponentially increasin in size	LOL you're working hard
bru no i literlaly want to learn shuffling so bad but its so hard to go fast	what is shuffling
like my body cant keep up	haha it's hard
 i think im too fat lol my body be too heavy to carry by my feet humping	oh shoot yeah that looks complicated
bruh yes	haha they look like gravity doesn't exist you're not fat tf
oWJEROUWEIRNUVOIU	do u remember i told u that story about putting the 100 dollar bill
??????????????/	i'lll tell u in a bit
me???? bruh what does he mean u??????	wait what what was he saying about you i filtered out everything what did he say
he said jianna is speaheading this project and is interested in word2vec and talking to u but... i didn't never said that	oh yeah
i think he mean tu	maybe idk
but then he was like stay after to talk and i have no knowledge maybe il just dip and be like woops internet HOEWRUWOEIURI	why is your FPR rate possible to be above like 1 tho
wait idk idk how i calculated it ...	arun and i have been talking about how max is performing the calculations and i'm incredibly weirded out the formulas don't matchc up to what i'm doing or the general formulas we should try to induce jasmin to ask about max's formula
LOL i think so too i just ran his code that he wrote on jiannatag where he calcualted fals epositive and neg so idk	ugh yeah then arun used that for his calculations too and it's wrong i think i looked through the formula idk if this is a smart math thing i don't get but i feel like rates have to be between 0 and 1
me too LOL i think tahts what a rate is but maybe he is taggign like per article how many tags? or\ idk	there's a per article and a per tag which is just so confusing to me jianna u missed the entire victory chant
huh wait i said victory??	your face
is it frozen yes i also agree am confused	no it was like deadpan
lmfao yes this is how i feel	LOL
oh hankg od it is u	i'm so confused what does this have to do with me nope it's you again
huh he is getting me and uconfused a lot i cant tell who hes actually tring to call jamie	waht why is he using my name i haven't looked at rubinovitz at all does he mean emily OMG he means emily
bruh no clue OIUEROIWUR jamie = emily = jianna hm i would hmmmmmm im sweating	LOL did u come up with that on the spot
bruh ya i literally have no clue tf	u should've asked him if he meant emily cuz like you've not been working on rubinovitz
dude ya im confused	LOL
jamei == bert	LOL i'll look into it but idk what averaging has to do with this and CNN ok sorry what what am i doing i signed up to meet with them i really don't want to implemenet their code F i am not interested in this at all
oh WHAT i thoght u wnted to	dude no he roped me into this last emeting i'm so annoyed that he roped me into this i'd rather build something myslef
ooHHHH what?!!!/? i did not tknow this this sneaky little	wait last time i said i wanted to do RNN haimo never spoke up and said she wanted to do rnn so she got to do her own lstm and i was doing that as well but i said something so he was like oh you know i have this friend who does blah blah would you want to be blah blah and then i was like oh uhhhh ok but i don't care at all
wait so u r implementing thi smans lstm?? and not ur own bruh	someone else's rnn that they built
ohhhhh so ur just running it?!??!	dude i have no fucking clue it's probably going to be data processing and i hate THAT SHIT i'm so fucking done
niuniu waiwai Huh	LOL i just left like two seconds ago
ahhahaha jamie u better get mine right	lol what get what right
In go/questions	Uh I don't remember I filled it out a while ago
No I mean Ok wait Just forget ignore Ok	Lol Ok there's a meeting rn boi jesus missed your call.
Ah fuck Wait for what I see Rip Am the only one In the meeting room	lol we finished
I realized f What did I guys U guys Talk about the fuck I’m so Not on top of thing s	LOL sam will reach out later
k k kk*	actually u should probably just text her directlly
lolz jamiei hope u have a good day:)	what why what's going on
wait nothing wishing u a good day	this is so suspicious what is going on
WHAT nothing is going on i swear	why
i just will wish yo a good day every morning	i've never heard u say this omg i'm honored but a little freaked out
HAHHAH i need to have a schedule so this will be the start fo my daily schedule	lol yeah i need as well
woops i also forgoto to go to pyplot rip i was like i feel like i have to do something	I didnt Go eithe is your stuff on admin panel deprecated it looks like it has your old admin panel formatting does timer have everything
Wait what	including the changes from adminpanel that are good
Yes	jianna/adminpanel ok
Jianna/timer	so i'm going to delete your old PR then
Ok	and start looking at jianna/timer
Yes Yes	also you're using a pacakge called js-file-download right i'm adding it to the package.json now but just make sure you use the --save tag so that when u build there aren't any dependencies missing
Oh I see ok so like Git add —save? Or got commit —save??	No when u add the package Like npm add or yarn add
Oooooooo I seeeeeeee	Yeah It's fine now tho I'll add those changes is the exportcsv only for projects also did u mean for the formatting to look like this what is person's name and picture i really like it tho but my recommendation would be like change the note in set timer to just be something that appears on the page instead of in the header and if you could change the view dbs to not show view users/projects immediately and instead just put them as little buttons that appear on the page when you hit view dbs cuz the formatting is a little weird rn lol oh i see the view dbs has to be pressed again for it not to appear
Wait let me respond when I get back But ty for these note	okie
ok i am back wow algorithsm wait i dont show user/projects imediately i do put them as buttons the person's name and pic was just like the users photo and name hahahha if they have a porfile photo i can put that there idk u sent me the photo of the dashboard and i liked ur prof pic surrounding	oh i see but only the admin should have access to it so i don't know if that's useful
ok i can make it so that the admin panel button si not shown unless your admin? like i was suposed to do that but i forgot thank you	yeah lol that's a good idea
for reminding me lolz wait so what shoul di change? that and set timer out of header anything else?	and make the buttons for view projects and view users like less confusing structurally
wait so don't have them as buttons?	you should but like notice how view users is at the end of the first row and view projects is in the second row by itself
"oh wow ur shows up differently sad mine shows below the view dbs button 
SAD ok i got tto fix that yes sorry did not notice it was diff on ur screen LMFAO WOEIRUWIOUROIWEr ok those three things anything else?"	i think it's the screen display that's it for now
okeyyy	also the export is just in gavel format/
:) huh? wait is this a question or a statement	is the* mb
yupp wait i actually dk ??? like huh	LOL how are u formatting the exported csv
um how the gavel csv is formatted okay yes in gavel i believe i just took justin's gavel csv and formmatedd okay bueno	lol i'm so confused by your train of thought
um final thought: yes	ok cool
:)	ok yeah so make those changes whenever u can and lmk michael julia and i are battling another thing rn
okeyyy LOL BATTLING what HAHHAHA i first read that as battling each other i was lke uhh	oh no we're battling a problem with redirects and refreshes f

dam	blood is rushing either up or down i usually go blind for a bit lol when i sit up in the morning what code r u using to process all the nyt articles
omfg bruh um oh i downloaded something frmo gitub but basically edited their entire code lmfoa bc it was so unncessary in thins	oh lol
i think its in my tor	is it somewhere ok
yes jianna/data1 /nytcorpus	yeah we'll just look at it together tmrw or today
kk	i mean
bet lol sam is like word w is just inerpreting words	yes interpreting words
ah	aha yeah this is this gist of this lab
i just realized lolz im kind of obssessed w saying lolz idk why its so fun	:oo i didn't see u use it that much

i think its the same	So we know which one is the new one
wait wdym	Rename the pickle file
i never changed the name so it replced the old pickle file	So people know which one is the new one Yeah But where
in the same place	Wait where was the same place
DATA1/JIANNA/maketestcsv/nyt-corpus/results.p	Oh Can u rename it to like NYTcorpus_new.p or something
k	And like out it where the other nytcorpus pickle file was before So people can recopy it to their directorjes
ya this is where it was before	Oh okay gr8
ok renamed	Cuz people have their own pickle files in their directories so now they can recopy it without replacing the old one Yeah but anyways Good stuff
jesus sent an attachment.	LOL

udacity LOL a free online	oh interesting
intro to neural networks course hehehehhe	oh work meeting sad :(
yessir	f i said something agai and now we have more homework let's schedule some time this weekend or today to build the histogram max wants
Wair I wasn’t there When he was talking	oh right
Whag is this	he wants a histogram of data from the nytcorpus of the length of each of the articles
I’m kinda busy this weekend but may also be free at some times just lmk	to see if there's skew in the data
ohhh	ok sure do u know when you're free i gotta fit into your schedule
LOL wait it’s flexible just give me a time And I can probably change From there	no no lol i'm j chillin this weekend u suggest to me
ok um saturday i cant do like 12-5pst sunday may be better? or saturday morning for me may be god oh wait or maybe saturday night	ok uh do u wanna just suggest a time then
LOOL ok yes sat my time 7pm pst? or anytime before/after	that's 10pm my time right
like +1 hr wait is taht ok or too late i feel like this task doesn't require much brain	i'll just try to do it now and then we can talk later to see if we need more i'll see if i can just do it
ok ur pref just lmk LOL if u need help	sure
sure hehheh	do we have matplotlib on thes erver
i think not sure can also use jupyter notebook?? ive never used matplotlib	how are these people making these graphs then i'm about to throw hands f
jupyter notebook i believe wati literally if u need help or want me to help i can do it just maybe not today so if u want to finisht oday then rip	that's just a browser based thing to run code lol
wait yes	you need a package to build the plots
but you can import matplotlib	i know but that will take the existing server oinstallations to check if that package exists they don't just appear no it's aight lol
Okeyyyyy	lmao nope somebody fucked with the conda environment and i think it got deleted so now none of the packages i need are there F
Can u Reinstall ?	i'm making my own conda environment rn there's so much to install tho lol
Also lol I am in the bathroom rn and I made this bruh looks so creepy	LOL is that your face symmetrical
LOL YES	wow that looks more different than i expected
DUDE ikkk	What app is that
TIK TOK	Holyyy
wait jamie	What's up
LOL wait ignore me sorry	Oh Ok
jamie was there a copy of like someone made a smaller dataset of the nytcorpus??	What Does this mean
like LOL i remmeber haimoshri asking like well basically im just playing with nltk rn hahhahahha to preprocess to see if i can maybe write word2vec in the future but like instead of preprocessing entirenytocrpus didn't she like make a smaller copy or like the first few or is there a way to do that w apickle file i simply cant memebr	I think she has a small CSV in her folder
ok but tahts with the wrong	U can easily get the first few rows tho
''.join right	Yeah
from a pickel file??	There's nothing with the new one yet
ohh ok	Yeah just iterate through the first few rows and write them to a cav Csv
oh hm okkeyyyy tyyyy	Yeah
yeeee	what brand is your sk crewneck from this year again
Um idk wait I’m not home rn but I’ll lyk	ok cool haha thanks
yeee It’s comfort colors	Oh yeahhhh Ty for checking
Ofcccc	jianna you should make your work seem more complicated lol
LOL wiat what work	like when you were describing fixing the corpus also did u see what he did to me
LOL YES	wow lucky you jianna
but FIXING THE CORPUS was just a space	I KNOW but you should have said we walked through all the code and found the error
ohhh	no need to explain
ur right okay	he doesn't care lol so like
sorry i will learn	do the bare minimum and be lie
next time yes	wowow i did a lot
wait i have a question do u get conceptually like w2v bc i am tad bit confused while writing this lolz	yeah it's like you transform a word into a representation in feature space
ok ya thats where i am tad bit confused so like does one go through each word in an article and each word is like a how-many-words-in-article length vector? like i thought it was like 500 legnth vector per word but in the image its only 3 words?? oh i totaly did not know it was called deep average network	wdym it's only 3 words
wait so thats like the context of the words ig? like that would be for one word like if that is one then its context is also that oh wait maybe im just supposed to have two lists okay wait ya i think i just got confused bc i thought i would only have to go through entire article and for each word put a 1 if its there or not LOL but then i think i got confused wait maybe this makes sense	the surrounding words
yaa we are +10 min too lng	true do you think we could use the general online descriptors from the corpus rather than normal descriptors or normal onilne descriptors
i use online_general?? if thats what you're asking?	oh really? so those are supposed to be the broad categories already? cuz i saw in rubinovitz's paper that there are like three types
wait if you print out the nytcorpus like the first bunch i cant remmeber what theyre called exactly but there are differnet types ya i believe but only the online_general are like the useful ones??	hmm ok i just saw some other stuff so i was curious
ya im not entirely sure what th eother ones are lOL bc i havent rlly looked into them rip	They're like taxonomies And more specific descriptors
ahhh ok are we supposed to use those? bc i dont think theyre in the csv to tags conversion are they	Idk Tbh
okeyy	I'm just trying to think of ways to make this dataset less shit
wait im so sorry am a little confused what is so shit about it i thougth it was bad bc it was ust rpeating??	Lol it's nothing wrong with the processing Im saying the data is originally just Bad And outdated None of the articles in there actually simulate real news And the tags are very strange to say the least
ahhhh wait ya i agree SO OUTDATEd i opened it with like a just cat and it was some strange symbols also why r u awake rn smh	lol I went to sleep
its me	What What is i
he was lik people share their screens for presentatations and he would liketo see who has the most compromising screen in the bakgrond	LOL it is you
Awwwww thanks fufu  How’d you know??	I put it in my calendar last year or before when u told me Hope it's a good one R u back home? Let's hang out sometime
What is it with people and putting stuff in there calendar Yup! I haven’t seen you in so long And my congratulations are overdue CONGRATS ON GETTING IN TO LIKE ALL THE BEST COLLEGES OMFG	LMAO thanks joe Heyyyy Google calendar is my best friend And for some reason It still looks like I have stuff in my schedule For no gosh darn reason I use it A LOT it's so useful Its what keeps me partially sane And I get to congratulate people on their birthday and not forget
Alice and shaily and god knows who also have my bday on their calendar for some reason I did use google calendar a lot last year Awww you’re the best fufu Clear all that shiz out girl you’re done	Ayeeeeee Bro I get stressed from my grad party commitments LMAO I keep having to like Wear dresses And Function as a human being And it's not working
Ooooo look at jamie being all popular  Why do you have to wear depresses Dresses I wore shorts and T-shirt’s to every one	Dress code And there's a bunch of Indian formals Boi I'm not even Why was I invited But now there's like A social obligation
Stupid formals Bro I’ve already skipped two	Boiii Stop SKIPPING u missed Leon's didn't u
I don’t think I was invited	Oh Well

I know you can’t wait to get wild in college	I'm at the library rn
Fufu the party queen	With a chemistry textbook Explain to me How I am a partier
Partying is a part of life Why Why Why	R u trying to tell me you've converted to partying Because Honestly there are so many changed kids Because Apparently I don't get credit for anything So I need to study To place out
Dude parties are so boring if you’re not drunk Oh ok that makes sense	Because being drunk makes ya dumb?
I thought it was “for fun” Hella dumb	Yeah no im not having a good summer
Sam *cough cough	all of them tho Max has pulled through for me a couple times this year with his chegg account Tho So I feel like I should be grateful Cuz diff eq answers ARE NOT ON SLADER
He had a chegg???	YEAH
Son of a gun didn’t share with me	I just kept nagging him Until he got the answers for me LMFAO
Such needy smh When’s the test	Orientation in august It's already June 11th tho And I'm not Accomplishing things
Is it supposed to be hard	They're like The final exams Of the classes And u have to pass They're hard
So like a 70?	Chem is apparently impossible So I need to stop studying and switch Yeah Something like that
Wdym stop and switch	To a different textbook In a different subject As in Give up Chemistry Forever
Are you tryna major in chem??	No computer science and business u goon It's a gen Ed tho
Then screw it	I have to take at least an intro chem class So like
Keep on studying girl	No getting out of ot STOP MOTIVATING ME You're supposed to feed my internal desire to not do work Omfg Unacceptable
GET WORKING ON THAT TREXTBOOK WHO DO YOU THINJ I AM	I dislike this optimism and enthusiasm Isn't college supposed to make u a cynical kiddo Why are u still A good kid
Bc I am very behind I need to catch up And I’m taking a spring semester rn so I can’t slack AND YOU ARE A GOOD KID TOO	WHAT NO YOU TOO WHYYYY My favorite college kids are still out colleging Can u stop No don't catch up stay a good kid forever You sent an attachment. Listen to this it's good I think
On the bright side I’m done in two and a half weeks! Woah that’s the weirdest korean hand writing I’ve ever seen	I'm going to be in China for like a week in two weeks Smh joe I am CULTURED Good luck joejoe Wait what class r u tsking Is it 281 or smth
Wow I really like that song He’s got some funky korean accent tho I couldn’t understand a word Yea 281	Lol you're a funny guy R u in Andrews class
Bro every Chinese person I know has gone or is going to China Yup	Oiiiiii
But I only go half the time	I'm only going for a week R u still doing OK lmao
That sounded so sarcastic :( Doing ok?	No you're actually funny Like In the class
Like in the class or in life	And in general too
Oh yea I think I should be fine	All the Chinese seniors gotta visit family before another four years of suffering Good good
I think I need like an 87 on the final to get an a according to Alice	IS ALICE TAKING IT TOO
Ah I feel ya	What in the world
She took it already	WHAT IN THE WORLD how did she take it even earlier than andrew
THATS WHY I NEED TO CATCH UP	HOW
She tested out of a prereq class (which I didn’t know was possible)	Oh shit Why is Alice treating college like a game isn't it supposed to be harder than this 
Oh dw it’s about to get real “fun” for us next semester Well I can’t say much since you’re going to frickin god college	I was actually told to test into eecs 280 by andrew Bro Im already just like Overwhelemed
Yea that’s the move	Like I have to submit this advising thing in 3 days And I'm fr Just I cant I can't think
Well you have the right to be overwhelmed	I don't know what to pick
For classes?	For ADVSING like There's advising sems and learning comms and traditional advising g And I might have to wrote some short answers to apply for some So like I shojld Hop on that
Ohhhh	I'm a whole mess But I did apply for housing a week ago So like Fingers crossed for my first choice And feeling accomplished
Three days is plenty of time pshhh I hope you get a good one	Me too lmao
Housing can be very disappointing VERY	There's an all girls dorm that my roommate likes so we ranked it 3 but I don't really want to be in all girls doem So I hope we get 1 or 2 I hope for good things
You always say you’re a mess and then you end up succeeding at everything in life Ah I see Fufu is single and ready to mingle 	That's not true My success rate is like 2% U just don't know about all 98 of my fails Omfg that's not it Ive just heard it's more conservative and there's not that many doubles in it anyways so it'd be hard for roommate and I to get something nice And I want to meet a lot of different people Plus girls like drama too much So that's just like A no for me It is close to main campus tho
My success rate is nonexistent so don’t you worry Truuuu girls be cray cray Close proximity to the campus is something you will value very much I wonder what’d it be like if jamie got into drama	Shut up that is FAKE NEWS Yeah I ain't about that walking life You'll have to keep wondering then I avoid it like the plague
College is a mysterious force It can change things unexpectedly about a person I’m glad that you do Drama is one of the reasons I did not like novi	LMAO ok you're korean tho u literally have very little say in whether u get to be involved or not the koreans love their drama also i'm watching this kdrama called abyss and i liked it at first but now the main characters are just being dumb and you're right college DO BE CHANGING PEOPLE
That is very true We’re born and bred from drama Oooo there’s an ost that I really like from that show Dude it’s crazy how much people have changed	"Lmao but you're not doing too bad Right Which song is it Is it the one where she's like ""I'm so lonely"" Because I relate Yeah I think it's WILD"
I think I’m pretty happy It’s called into the abyss with Suran and coogie Coogie’s one of my favorite rappers You are NOT alone fufu College is full of opportunities 	Wait I'll look it up LMAO don't do this to me Oh shit I recognize the song Well Yeah that's obvious The intro is so like Drama flashbacks tho
Oh honey you got a real fun year ahead of you I haven’t watched a drama in like two years Got any recommendations	"Ofc What do u like to watch tho Like genre style ITS THIS ONE CHORUS ""I'm so lonely"" Lmao"
Romance of course A bit of action so it doesn’t get boring in the middle Interesting premise Dang the artist is evened names Kim “Feel” Not the most uplifting work out song but i can totally relate as well	Lmaooo Ok Let's see Abyss is actually pretty in line with what u described Strong woman do bong soon is too but it's like Cheesy And cringier than normal Legend of the blue sea was better than I thought it would be school 2015 was pretty good but u won't like the antagonist at all Suspicious partner is quite good Although again sorry I didn't finish it Sky castle is more like drama and less romance Althougj there might also be romance idrk I was on episode 2 of 3 Or* Weightlifting fairy has less action but it's really funny Bride of the water god is not as funny more romance and drama but not bad either
Oh wow I was not expecting this many suggestions you really went all out Titles for these dramas are so fruity	I even pulled up my list of unfinished dramas for u see I commit Ikr I'm hoping they're better in korean
Oh I saw a bit of strong girl It was very cringe	Lmao I agree Did u start from the beginning Or like Randomly watched scenes on fb
I think I saw like the first half of the first episode	Lmao wait just watch weightlifting fairy and tell me what u think
I knew from the beginning monologue it was gonna be cringe	I think that's some of the funniest shit ever Lmaooh yeah I rememver
Alrighty weightlifting fairy it is	Sorry there's a monologue in the beginning of weightlifting fairy too But
What’s it about	"It's like You'll understamd So there's these two university athletes and whatever university And the girl is this weightlifter and the guy is a swimmer And basically she realizes that she's not like the model of ""perfect woman"" when she sees this really hot guy on the roads and then she basically signs up for his weight loss clinic Even tho weightlifters aren't supposed to lose weight And then that doctor hot guy whatever turns out to be that swimmers older brother, who after running into the girl one day figures out that they used to be childhood friends But she used to be called ddoong or smth so it's like shes real annoyed at him but he thinks hes just having some fun And I'll let u watch the rest"
That actually sounds very interesting You’re like a drama Wikipedia	Bro not even U should see like Saranya Also I can never finish dramas
LOL SIRACHA	Cuz they get so gd cringey Omfg
Yea she’s a real drama fan I remember her talking with Emily	Smh she watches like seasons of TV shows in a day too Its wild
That’s what make dramas drama She’s more korean than me	Ugh but I don't like that part of the dramas Yeah facts She keeps tryna drag me along to learn black pink dances w her
OMG YOU SHOULD HIT YOU WITH DAT DUDUDUDUD	NO WTF WHY R U ENCOURAGING THIS AGAIN Whst What the
ITS FUN DO IT FUFU	No smh we already tried I look like a wiggling potato
EVEN BETTER I wish I could’ve seen it	No Fight me Go watch your drama Stop doing this to me
Bro if I can dance you can def do it too If SAM can dance you can	I DONT EVEN LISTEN TO BLACKPINK Lmao I can probably dance better than sam Hopefully OK maybe not But like U get it NO DESIRE TO
Yea you prob can YOU CAN DO IT LET SARANYA TEACH YOU Did you go to the ib talent show	No but I saw your performance on video And Jason and Daniels Funniest shit ever ^
Their performance sure got the ladies going Even DONGHA did it	LMAO No it did not
Dude I could hear all the girls screaming I wish they did more songs	Out of all of them tho Why would they choose The ece Eve
Because they wanted to show off their sexy side Dongha really knows how to move his hips 	Gross
They’re the best Koreans in novi	They're the only Koreans in novi
Take your pick It’s the best of the BEST	I don't know what to tell u joe But you're not a very good wingman
LOL I am the most unqualified wingman	I would agree unfortunately Ok so abyss got dramatic by ep 12 ugh
And that’s a bad thing Isn’t it a drama	Yes it's a bad thing I mean But they're being so dumb
Why are they dumb Do they not see that they’re in love	I mean yeah that But also It's a dumb mystery/crime drama And I'm no detective But they're so dumb
LOL Is the mystery super easy to solve but no one can solve it?	Yes Like And The police are bad at following proper procedure
LOL Analyzing police protocol in korean dramas	No joke they just let witnesses stay unprotected and apparently there's only two staff that actually do things and they never wear policy uniforms and are never available
So they made the show longer than it should’ve been I feel ya I guess abyss is not on my to-watch list	It's like Midway through 1-10 is good U can watch up to there I start a lot of dramas and never finish anyways I think ahn hyoseop is really good looking tho I can't see the serious role as very suited for him thi Cux I saw him in that YouTube original drama top management first And shit was weird af but funny lmfao
I have no idea who that is but korean names spelled in English look funny	Uhhhh Lemme look it up What the fuck he's 6'2
Some people are lucky  Ya boy’s been stuck at 5’10 3/4” Looks like a typical korean actor	Bruh Donate some height man That's not called stuck That's Above average If you're over 6 foot I automatically dislike u Like Why is the world unfair Im like Basically 5'5 alright
LOL Do you want to be 6 Isn’t 5’5 above average for women	That's like 1 inch above average But the problem is We're not as skinny as guys so we look even shorter I want to be like 5'7 5'8
Dw you still got time Oh wow I didn’t think of it like that before Aren’t guys usually thicker	Not really Some guys eat like 10 lbs worth of food and don't gain any weight How is that possible
I am definitely not one of those guys Some people are just not favored in the metabolism gene :(	you're still like A twig So Dwai
Me??? Bro was still chubby in high school	That's definitely fake news Because I knew what u looked like in hs
That’s cuz I wore big clothes I’m still on the higher end of bmi	Boi Bmi ain't shit
That’s true But if still like to get down to 150 I’m like 163 rn	OK so That's fine
Dude that is not fine My body fat percentage is crazy high	STFU IDC YOURE NOT FAT JOEJOE SO STFU AND FIGHT ME
WHAT DO TOU MEAN You talk like someone who’s fat WHICH YOU CLEARLY ARE NOT	OK I'm not fat but I sure as hell ain't skinny either I'm a happy medium And u are too So shaddup
I’m trying to be better than a happy medium And you’re an athlete you are better than a happy medium	ha good one i want u to physically fight me
Wdym tennis is a very demanding sport Idk what you’re talking about	Nahhh  opinion

You always remember  thank you Did you just accidentally text me happy birthday that was meant for another joe smh	No I meant to say shin Because I like that version of your name better
I guess we’re just not on a first name basis yet :(	Don't u remember I put it in my calendar in compsci Wat Nooo It's not like that
You’ve been cheating on me with another joe!	LMAO
Is he like joe lin or joe fin	Wow
xin	U really got me there How did u know
They call me Sherlock joelmes in my home town How’ve you been fufu	Is it just me or have u gotten funnier Dude I've had some many existential crises in the past year it's not even funny
Probably just you Lay it on me homeslice	Wait like Now that I should be trying to be Educated And employed I'm like Oh shit What do I get employed in What do I want to learn Do I actually like this or is it just there Whos gonna employ me this is how it goes
Ahhh the classic “oh crap I’m going to be an adult soon I want to climb back into the womb” realization Have you decided on a major	me alll the time i was p sure i was gonna study cs before i went to college and like i'm still p sure i'm going to stay studying cs but sometimes i'm like what if i just studied public policy and then i realize that would be awful because i hate talking professionally and wearing suits and giving presentations that require sLIdE deCKs
amen to that sister if you can't wear a t-shirt and pajamas you at the wrong place I'll be honest with you man, I think of switching majors ALLLLL the time My main motivation is and always has been money, and I just want to find a job that can make me comfortable Are you on track for a cs degree?	that totally makes sense aren't u worred about like not liking it tho yeah i've basically been frontloading cs classes for the last two semesters but next semester i'm probably going to take a business class and an econ class i took 3 cs courses last semester and it was not it i was dying in the beginning but it got better tho i'm thinking of minoring or doublign in finance just cuz like idk anything about money so i should probably learn at some point
I am certainly worried about not liking it. My first two weeks of software dev has been kinda poo poo and idk how many of my future jobs will be like this It was not it as in too much work or cs in general is not enjoyable? Bro. That was exactly what I was thinking when I was scheduling Like why are there eight different types of taxes that bleed my bank account? How do I get a credit card? Idk Do you have any clue as to what type of job interests you	Yeah I feel that I did some stuff over iap with software dev and I was like meh Too many classes lol HAHA EXACTLY We can learn togetherlmao OK so I thought I wanted something fast paced and unpredictable But then I realized I'm kind of high anxiety and stress So unpredictable is not bueno Fast paced is OK tho I want something where I don't just apply the same skills over and over to the same problem Or even different types of the same problem I want something where I continuously have to do new things and/or talk to people that are Nof Not Going to judge me
Bro I totally feel that	It be like that sometimes Anyways how'd u celebrate Today
I really want to go into ml/ai stuff because you’re programming how humans think and the human mind is always malleable	Yesterdah Honestly cogsci is the way to go We're really far off from general ai
Well I didn’t plan anything but a bunch of friends came over at night and we played ultimate	And all of the ML work I do now is just like Not that interesting Aye that's great
I got three cakes so I’m saying hello to the new 20 lbs I’ll be getting to know I took a cogsci class last semester and it was pretty interesting Awww that’s not good to hear	Dude yesssas Wait does this mean you're younger than dongha I took an intro psych class last semester and it was kinda fun but like Didn't really cover what I wanted it to Aha wait no I shouldn't discourage you It can be very interesting I think but Theres definitely methodologies we're lacking And u have to understand math well to develop it at this stage
On paper yes, I am younger than dongha, but in reality, dongha is younger than everybody	LOL Yeah that's so true
are you planning on taking more	I might honestly I'm thinking I just took the wrong cogsci class I should get into neuroscience and see if that's any good I'm more interested in social psychology I think tho
are you saying im not good at math  oooooo I do like seeing why people do what they do, controlling them like a puppetmaster, making them do our biddin The coolest job I can think of is doing ml in medicine/neuroscience But I have no idea how to get there	No I'm saying I'm not good at math I'm sure you're excellent HAHA yes Exactly this Ooh very interesting Maybe u can do a urop in a neuroscience lab during the school year
So to summarize, face pace job at the intersection of compsci and psychology (preferably social) that is always evolving and challenging I can't do urop anymore i'm too old I'll try to do some research tho hopefully if they accept me	Haha is this you or me Or both of us I would say I'm interested in psychology but more as a side thing I think I seriously doubt medicine is where I'll end up Oh wait is it limited to underclassmen? I think urops work different at mit
For you m'lady	Ohhh Haha yeah you're almost on the dot then That would be cool tho We just call all undergrad research urop
I really want to get a phd, dr. shin just sounds too good	LOL please do it
yup when you get too old you just gotta find individaul professors	You set the nickname for to dr shin. Let's celebrate preliminary ily Ah I see
wait so you want more psychology or more cs	More cs Ill probably just study psych on the side Actually Less cs tho Like Tech management is kind of Probably where I want to end up
So like a project manager?	Perhaps Probably on consumer facing products But idk I might get bored of that I thought consulting for about but I don't have the right temperament or presentation skills for that F anyways the point is idk
i feel that You actually have a lot of options in your mind lol	Yes Do u see the predicament I am someone who just Ugh idk I am a ball of anxiety A potato of uncertainty
You're young homie you can try everything out and see what you like the most You still have at least 3 years left of school Dw for peopl elike you, the potato of uncertainty can turn into french fries of happiness	Haha yes that's true there's still time Omg this was so poetic
Everyone is burdened by anxiety of the future, but we move on and when we look back it almost seems comical	Dude You're so wise We need to talk more I need to absorb all this Wisdom Thank u Dr shin For the lrescription prescription Also I need to wake up at 7 tmrw So I need To probably fall asleep in the next 4 minutes F Gn tho let's talk tmrwwwww
"yeah rn i'm blocked bc i can't install psycopg2 i'm basically getting clang errors when i try to install it i've tried doing a bunch of stuff that's recommended online like making sure that postgres is installed first and stuff like that but it hasn't worked so the entire output is really long but I think this is the main error part: ld: library not found for -lssl
    clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)

okay great, thanks!	but yeah take care of yourself first lmao take your time
hey i think i finally got everything set up!! where can i find all of the info that I need for config.py? i looked in go/accounts but idk which thing goes where and if all of the info i need is there lol	Amazing yeah so you'll need a dB Uri and for the other stuff u can just put like localhost or random stuff Hold on let me see if I can pull up mine
oh okay lit also this would probably be better to discuss during like a GSD or something but is there a description of the api so that I know how to make api calls like to get project info and stuff and will the ProjectView component have properties of like the current user and stuff I was trying to start adding some code for the tasks that you highlighted for me	"DEBUG=True
FRONTEND_URL=""""
JWT_SECRET_KEY=""jamie""
QUILL_SSO_KEY=""yHo0CYhnTuBSK3oLw35k""
QUILL_URL=""
SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS=False
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI= justin said it's not secure to send the db uri's around so let me make a one time link  i think i may have written an endpoint for the get request your're talking about i pushed it to my own branch jamie/project-routes i think and there's like a general doc too let me find it go/dev-spectacle-backend"
awesome, thanks!! is there already an endpoint that retrieves all projects, or just a project with a specific id?	Just a project with a specific id U don't have to worry about rendering all the projects in their project cards yet Project view should just be the view of one single project I'll write one so u can get all projects this weekend tho Projects view ( I need to change the name) is different
ooh okay I started with ProjectsView lol do you know what properties ProjectView has yet like if it has a property that's the project id of whatever user	Yeah so like there should be a project name/id associated with the current user Also the quill sso doesn't really work rn So j won't be able to log in I think And then you'd want to display some of the stuff from the project db table Did I understand your question correctly lol
oo okay I see I was just asking if that project info would be passed down via properties in React instead of having to do the db query directly from the ProjectView component	Oh yeah it'd be pulled from the db I have no idea how react works oops I should learn
theoretically if you do the db query at the top level of the project (like once the user is logged in in App.js or something) then you can just pass down properties about the user/their project via React properties instead of having to repeatedly query the db that's something that we can worry about later tho lol	Oh huh ok I'll look into that lol Thanks julia hey julia just wanted to check in on your progress btw i have an endpoint for getting all projects now it's in my branch jamie/project-routes but we're planning to merge everything in soon also once you're done can u make a PR to merge into master
yee so I’ve started creating the front end for the project view page I was just stuck on how user info would be passed through react also yeah the endpoint for all projects will be very useful ty and I have my own branch I just haven’t pushed it yet okay I finished like the initial design stuff and I pushed my branch so now I just have to make it so that it actually uses the endpoints to get like real info instead of the filler stuff that I have there for now oh and I made a temporary /project endpoint on my branch just so that I could look at the page I was making lmao	yeah no problem that works ok cool will u make a PR too
yes sorry I just saw this!!! hello what endpoint do I use to get all projects?	/project Or /projects Hold on It's /api/project
is there anything in the database rn so that i can test stuff or if not how do i add stuff	Justin knows all the commands I forget now But u can add stuff with SQL commands I think there's like 1 or 2 entries in rn U can add stuff with POST requests too
ooh ok bc when i tried doing the get request rn it didn't return any entries	Oh did Justin clear it? It's possible but there were 2 last time U can add with POST request
wait i can just do a get request to localhost:3000/api/project right	Yes
doing that just gives me some html output	Can u send a screenshot Also I'm about to get on a plane so I'll be offline for a few hours
this is on postman and if i do it on a browser it just gives me the nav bar with a blank page beneath it	Oh Justin says this error usually means there's a problem with the code vs the request Uhhhh I noticed yesterday when I was trying to name something that I was getting an error from projectview.js Or smth but also this was a file that didn't exist in the repo Is there some configuration that needs to be done for it
oh i had to change that it’s in the repo but it wasn’t being imported in app.js so there’s no error there now	Okay cool Awesome
but the request is still being weird lol i can message justin since ya gotta go fly ahahah	Oh hmm Uhhhh Okay sounds good I'll check in with u tmrw?
sounds good!! have a safe flight:))	Tyty
hola is the endpoint for getting individual project info /api/{project_id}	/api/project/project_id
how the hell do you debug this trash assembly code like for bubblesort my code is printing out a list that looks sorted but i'm failing the test case	LMAO uhhhhh have u tried OH maybe u need to store the answers in the correct registers i forget if they teach u that earlier on
ooh i was gonna go to office hours but i can’t talk LOL it’s okay i have time lmao	oh right lmfao uhhhhh idk u just gotta step through ngl the debugger kinda shit
update i fixed my stupid assembly code LOL the addresses were off by one rip	U suxk lol But congratulations
thanks i’m pretty proud of myself lol	I'm proud of u too
hello there would you happen to have an idea why i would get an infinite loop when i try to do performance counting on the dumb 6.004 lab lmao	Was ir doing an infinite loop before Its probably not infinite it's probably when u print you're doing it on every recursive call You need a wrapper to do the counting
i have a wrapper and it’s still infinite :((	Uh are you storing an ra for the wrapper
yes :((	Wait so there was no infinite before? Send me a screenshot
no like my code passes	Weird Hmm yeah s9 that looks right Is it printing anything at all when u run it Or just not completing Oh wait Oh jk Unless you need smth in qsort That depends on your other temps being somethinf Oh shit Are u using t1 in call qsort Because you're using it after like You haven't stored that value on the stack
no i don’t use any t registers in the other functions	Save it anyways It's possible call has some intermediate things And also u didn't answer my question about whether it's printing anythinf
oh yeah it doesn’t print it just takes forever and says that it timed out and i tried saving t1 and that didn’t do anything	Bring it to OH tmrw lol 1-3pm is me
yeah that's what i'm gonna do lmao i gave up awhile ago	LMAO ok nice
dumb question where is the cover photo lmao	go/cover i think yeah it's there
beautiful thank you that's what directors do ;)	omfg yw
LOL	sean wants any type of candy tell kathryn too
amazing thank you	yep
salutations tengo unas preguntas sobre spectacle in my tasks what's the thing about creator_id and team_name being automatically populated and also what does connecting teammates function to backend mean i asked justin and he said he doesn't remember and i should ask you lmao	so like justin started some frontend stuff for a user profile we commented out on the master branch acutally it might be uncommented now on master but basically it's all just dummy things inside of it rn he was supposed to make some requests to our backend endpoints to populate teammates and user profile details as well as team_name the creator_id and team_name should automatically populate when u submit a project as well by pulling data from the user db given the jwt token
ah i see gracias	Yep
hello friend does the user profile thing have its own file like is it in client/src/components	no technically it's all just in app.js rn
ooh ok ok	yeah we commented it all out but if u pull the recent master i think it's up to date and uncommented again
wait rn so if i log in it takes me to the projects page	yeah it should do that right lilke with the project cards adn then somewhere in the top left there should be the user profile drop down
is that different from the team dropdown	oh no it's the same thing ohhhh
oh ok ok got it lmao	i see what you're asking yeah like ideally eventually each user will have their own user profile page too but there's allso that convenient drop down for now to see all those thing
okay cool and rn i'm just gonna replace the random filler stuff with actual useful info lol	yeahhh that would be bueno
fab ty my dude	yes my dude
hola amiga is there an endpoint to get info about a team bc rn user info just gives me a team name but not like info about the other people in a team i may just be blind	yeah it's supposed to be a get idk why jianna has it as a post /team/teammates it might be a recent change have u pulled master recently do u want to change it to a GET actually
ah i see i'll pull it and yee i can change it to gET	"hihi so the next thing to do for spectacle is to make an edit button for your project if it's before the submission deadline also is there like a ""my project"" button on the user profile cuz that would be useful and then also remove the submit button after the submission deadline has passed or if the hacker has submitted their project already"
yeeee okie sounds good	profile picture popping
hehehe self portraits in my backyard 	so goodoodod ok so i'm like not sure why but there s some weird things happening when i test the user profile dropdown i sent u an email with the video since the file size is too large for me to send it here
okie i’ll take a look i didn’t get an email :0 did you send it to jgonik @ mit	yeah i think so? maybe it went to spam i didn't put anything in the body
oh i got an email in spam that says the message was too large to send maybe trying sharing it in google drive instead	f ok
i still don't see it if you shared it btw lmao	oh yeah it was just taking forever to upload i haven't shared it yet what's your gmail
juliagonik@gmail.com	ok i finally did it
muchas gracias	haha yee
okay so it seems like there are some inconsistencies between localhost:3000 and localhost:5000 bc on 3000 all the changes work fine but on 5000 it's still the default things and the gallery of projects doesn't show up on 3000 for some reason also	oh huh rip yeah it'll be deployed like with the 5000 version tho right cuz that's just compiling all the react right
yeah idk i'll try to figure out why it's being weird	hey julia did you ever figure out that weird redirect error cuz now i'm seeing sort of the same thing on master i think it might have to do with the way react does the redirects from login/success anyways if you plan on talking to justin about it at any point can u bring up this weird thing too i'll ask jason if we can't figure it out too
wait i think it was just because you have to build it when you make a change i think justin updated the readme unless you're referring to something else lol	like the manage team button disappearing between login and refresh page refresh*
oh oh yeah i never figured that one out	Lol rip uhhh I'll play around with it some more this week ok so i have a few problems/questions the manage team dropdown isn't supposed to appear at all at first i think and then when loginview redirects to root team dropdown doesn't update until reload because it's not part of the switch right or something like that anyways i find it really strange that it even appears at all before login
yeah i have no idea what’s happening with it tbh lol bc i just replaced the filler stuff in the js file but i didn’t touch where it’s included in the nav bar if you know what i mean so i think this issue has been happening for a hot minute ??	yeah probably i think it's also something i'm just noticing now because we didn't have sso working at the time ok so i figured out why team dropdown doesn't render until reload i think it's because there's some if else statements now and it's not updating on refresh so it's rendering the empty div
ooooh	i think michael had a similar issue but he just fixed it so i'm going to check w him now
okay sick i vaguely remember being slightly confused by this lol react deprecated a function that i used to use for this	oh lolll yeah wait everybody is using route in different ways like apparently the correct way to do it if u don't have props is component but then other people have like return <view> it's very interesting
oh hm well for me the issue stems from the fact that i'm doing a get request to get some info that i need to display	yeah
so i need it to either automatically refresh after the get request is complete or not render until the request is complete	Oh I seee
wait i'm gonna play with it i think i might've figured out a way to make it work	ok cool lol i also just talked to justin about it and he said we can pass in some props from the loginview redirect to instruct those components to re render
ooh ok	let me send u the link real quick i gtg rn but i'm going to continue thinkning about this tmrw 
okie cool i'm also gonna try something and see if it works	:DDD
ok i think i figured out what the issue is but idk how to fix it for some reason after the redirect the api call is giving some html response instead of the user json that it's supposed to give so then stuff doesn't get populated bc the promise fails bc it can't convert the response to a json	yeah it's because when it starts rendering it's using /login/success probably the api call is trying to do like /login/success/api/user/current probably can u pass in this.state.user as a prop to teamdropdown oh i suppose u can add a key too
i would only be able to pass it down from App.js but idk if it's the best idea to make the get request there also wdym by add a key	so like i saw that you can add in keys to components to make them re mount on some state change so my idea was that every time the value in state.user changes u remake the fetch but that might be getting set before the redirect which doesn't solve the problem ok i think i fixed it i'll commit to your branch oh also i noticed that the project status isn't quite right and also when u have time can u make it so that submit project doesn't appear if i've already submitted my project
oh sick ok yeah the project status was still filler	Oh okay dope
oh also rn there are two submit buttons one on the left of the navbar and one on the right	Oh yeah Michael turned the one on the right into a logout button So u only need to change the left one
okay cool wait if the project is already submitted they can edit up to the deadline right	Yeppp But like they should probably be able to access their own project from their team drop down or something like that So they don't have to scroll through the project cards to find it
i was thinking of changing the submit project button to an edit project button once they submit	Ohhh Yeah that's smarter than anything I was thinking of Haha
lol sick btw rn there's no endpoint to remove someone from a team the current user can only leave their team	Oh hmm would it make sense for the team creator to be able to remove other team members I also don't even know of we have that attribute in our table So maybe comment that part out for now is fine
quick pregunta is the quill sso for spectacle also not redirecting for you	uhhh last time i chekced it was shirlyn only whitelisted localhost5000 for me tho
oh hm it was redirecting for me but now it's not lol	oh uhh let me check your branch right?
yeee gracias	ok same the login button isn't responding
oof i also tried on master and had the same issue	it's probably a quill thing
yeah that’s what i was thinking too	ok yeah shirlyn will help us whitelist it again
sounds like a plannnnnn	yo sometime before general today can u drop in the estimates for shipping again real quick under go/nm swag options + budget changes

hey you should be able to push now lmk if you still have issues you should try pushing up your branch, then merging it into develop and see if it still runs if it does, then push develop  and then make the setting with start time of the judging round and that'll just be your task for the week	Okkk thanks justin Do u mean merging locally my own branch with develop
Ye And test it to make sure it works	OK will do
"Awesome yo so about your task this week
so there aren't actually really any Quill tasks that are quick and can be wrapped up
so instead I think it will be most efficient if you learn some JS



go through at least the 'Basics', 'Functions', 'Array' , and 'Operators' sections.
so you understand Javascript

this will be useful later for both learning Node.js, a JS backend framework, and React, a JS frontend framework Jianna has the same task also if you wanna learn Flask more in depth, check what I sent to #dev"	oh cool thanks justin yeah i saw the link i'll take a look jianna and i are looking at the settings db changes today
for Gavel?	yus
awesome lmk if u have any questions or get stuck	r u going to yamatos yeah np should be ok
no i dont think i will have time rip but i think you guys should! meet the devs of other committees they r cool peeps	:pp okie there should be functionality to add a start_time row when start judging is clicked now but i want to also change the start judging button to a stop judging button when it's hit and then the stop judging button puts in an end_time into the settings db too but idk how to format the value parameter to do that like i saw on each of the annotator/judge rows the enable/disable button does that but idk how to make the conditional without the use of some db parameter
hmmm wait wdym? you could just create a new row in the settings table right	Yeah like I already did that But basically for the start judging button Once u hit it I want it to turn into a stop judging button And u can start and stop judging multiple times then
ooh	I figure I can make a separate js function to do that but wouldn't I have to put it in a separate js file for cleanliness and that seems like overkill So I'm wondering if there's like a oneliner easy way to do this
"there's not a oneliner but maybe like a 3 liner lol  this is the built-in way of storing state in a Flask app using the ""g"" object"	Ah hmm OK This sounds like a tmrw problem then lmao Thanks I will try to figure this out
"ok awesome lmk if u run into any problems  <head>
<script src=""
</head> hey is it ok if i switch my cleaning slot to 9:00 - 9:20? woops wrong chat lol"	Yes sir u may Lol Hey my parents just rebooked my flight home this weekend so I'll actually be gone all of next week aka I won't be at the dev meeting Also is it alright if I take a one to two hour break during devhacks on the 7th WBL is running a high school outreach event and they want my stock pitch team to present to them
ya no prob, do you know when that break will be?	11-1 ish I'm p sure
aight sounds g Heyo You signed up as interested to be on point for spectacle Just wanted to get a sense of what your time commitment will look like for this semester and iap	Yeee Uhhh I have about an hour every week for wbl and another hour for startlabs I go to tennis sometimes but the commitments pretty chill like max 4 hours a week and I can work around it And that's about it Over IAP I'm doing an externship idk if that's going to be a problem
Ye that all sounds g I guess mainly I want to let you know that leading a project will take a lot of work and organization Like for example you'll probably have to be the one to pull the slack when other ppl don't do work But it's super rewarding And I can help guide cuz I will also be working on spectacle Ya if that all sounds good I'll put u as project lead for Spectacle	oh shoot yeah i'm really down i don't know much yet but i'll put in as much time as i need to learn it :DD
Wow y'all new devs are making me so proud   Alright sounds like a plan	lmaoooo omg haha i'm excited tho!!!
yo were you able to take a look at Spectacle at all	aw shit not yet ummmm i have a two like final quizzes in 004 and 009 coming up this wednesday and thursday but i have nothing going on friday so i can look then or during dev gsd this week you're talking about like what you guys have currently specced out for spectacle right
ya no worries. I am also thoroughly and utterly fucked this week	big sad
main thing is, I'm gonna come up with a task planning structure for what we want to get done this Saturday and I'll need your help to fill in some tasks for ppl on Spectacle. but that can be done on Friday and we will discuss it this wed	ok that sounds good i should reference the doc that was on one of our dev meeting notes right i think there were two right
ye just go to go/dev and then within Projects/Spectacle there are a bunch of notes	oh excellent that's awesome Hi can u tap me ib hey justin did u set the go link yet for some reason it is leading me to this sign in page for this univ that i did research at like 2 summers ago
Uhhhhh Gimme one sec	Okay thanks lol I have no idea why it's redirecting me there So weird Also I'm going to be a little late my class doesn't end until 10
Lmao wait which go link?	Go/hangouts Wait I literally don't know why it's redirecting me I even looked on redisred and tried the link? Idk do u think you could send me an invite through google or smth i have no idea what is going on
huhhh whats ur gmail	wait i'm actually tripping i just cleared my cache from all-time and it started working what the heck
LOl huh thats so weird hey for Spectacle do you think you have a pretty good sense of the scope of the project?	Uhhh I think so but wdym by scope
like roughly how many hours of dev time it would take, how to delegate the project b/w ppl etc. I'm gonna try to schedule dev GSDs throughout IAP, so want to get a sense how many each project might need each GSD would be like a ~4-6 hour sprint oh also I would say try to delegate more critical functionality to ppl on campus, and a bit less to ppl off campus just by the nature of how ppl work. (with the exception of Jack who can probably get it done) actually if you're free tomorrow do u want to meet for like 30 min to talk over how to execute on Spectacle? And then we can discuss it further at Dev meeting	Sure I usually don't get back from work until like 630pm but anytime after tmrw should work Oh hmm I haven't thought about this yet Wait is Julia on campus do u know You're not on right Oh wait u said u wanted to meet
lol ya i'm on campus Julia Jianna and Jack arent oh wait that's it lmao how about tomorrow at 8?	Yeah sure where do u want to meet
Stud? I'm flexible	sure i'm assuming u mean stud 5 right
Ye Hey can we push to 8:30	yeah i can also do earlier if that's easier too
Ok cool Cant do earlier rip I'll see u at 8:30!	OK sure
im on the old side in one of the rooms on Stud 5	OK I'm omw
btw do you have a design in mind for spectacle like UI-wise	Just something clean I don't really like round edges looks too cutesy Lol is this what u went Meant* Uhhj the menu can be upper left bar which expands to a invite and join which changes when signed in I should think more about this tmrw at gsd lol Draw a diagram/picture
lolol ya eventually we'll need a good design of everything, for now since we're just getting started we can make some pretty standard components and just do default theming and stuff	Yeah Makes sense
Yoyo when r u planning on coming for Spectacle?	Oh shit mb sorry I slept really late last night and I just got up I'll eat really quickly and come in a bit
Ya no rush I'm currently still porting things over to semantic But almost done	OK thanks Is it a party over there
Do you know if Jianna is going to be free today to work?	How's it going so far
Lol no it's literally just me :') a few on campus ppl told me they couldn't come	I think she said she might ask me if she needs help So I think she has it planned
Ok cool. Ya it's fine if ppl work asynchronously as long as we have smthn going by the end of today Ok finished semantic ui stuff Not sure if I want to start App.js until theres an idea of the design tho. We probably should do that first	Okay Sorry I'm not there yet lol Just started eating
Lol nw, no one else is either Jack said hes joining in the afternoon ish, Julia's in Spain so she's not sure of her schedule	This is so saf Jianna said she's gonna start at q 1
Oh ok cool Ya it's harder than I thought to coordinate over iap Especially cuz most of Spectacle team is not here lol Ok I'm gonna go out and grab lunch, I'll be back in BC in 30 min or so	OK I'll head over once I'm done can i come over now
Ye	ok i'll start heading over jianna just called me hto
Ooh is she tryna get into go/hangouts	oh right
Not at my computer rn but tell her gimme like 5 min	she said nobody responded to her request I'm here You called Justin.
"ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C ""your_email@example.com""  swgswQKcqQEGn7A"	I can't make second gsd sorry
Ok nw hey would you be able to draw up a design for Spectacle by this Saturday? like a draft for frontend	Do u mean like actually draw And yeah
lol up to you you can also try using software like Figma	oh cool yeah i'll take a look this'll be fun what the heck figma is so hard to use
Oh oof really	i can't even draw the three bar menu thing in there properly well at least the free version doesn't have anything i'm just really confused i'm just gonna draw
Lol hmm I've never really used figma But if u have specific questions I can ask my friend who's a figma god	uhhh well my one question is why can u only put elements on with like 5 different shapes like rectangle, circle, arrow, line am i just supposed to use the pen for the rest? it's nbd but i don't really understand the concept of how this is easier
hmmm rip can't help too much tbh, haven't used Figma but also you could jsut sketch it on paper lemme ask Gary what he usually creates mockups with	aight cool Is there still a meeting at 10
yup oh fuck forgot to remind	Lol nice
Yo were you able to make any progress on the markups? Also Gary responded, he just uses figma lll	Aw shit not yet I'll work on it tmrw morning
Ok cool no worries do you think you can get it done by tonight?	Yes it's just drawings tho :((
ok no worries	hey justin i just made an account on appreader
Nice Confirmed	cool thanks lol there's rankings nice i just ran out of stuff to do at work so this is perfect
Amazing lmaoo	were students not forced to pick a track when they applied
Nope I think it was optional	oh ok cool lol even though we've been hiding names all these kids have been putting it p obviously into their fruit nicknames
Lmao rip Ya it's hard to do full blind apps Last year we had ppls githubs	oh shoot yeah lmao
And most of the time it was their name Lol	oops :pp
Damn Reading 86 apps	LMAO The thingie asked me to read 99 before more people signed up So I thought I had to read that many
U took care of like 2 other ppls apps lmao Oh lll Woopsie	Like it calculated the total divided by how many there are people signed up right Oops Well Im done at least So that's nice Didn't get to participate in the fire apps channel but Oh whale
Lmao Oh whale	who do we need to talk to get quill sso set up also r u going to make the develop branch and put in the PRs for it or should i do it and also i'm gone from like friday afternoon to sunday late evening so i won't be back on campus until monday basically
Oof ripp Actually we can just merge to master Until we have the first working iteration going I'll create a PR for my task U should tell Jianna and Julia to make PRs when they finish theirs	okay got it i think jianna already has a pr in actually i think she accidentally made it the other time i'll ask if it's updated uh but yeah what should we do about quill
wdym about quill? oh SSO so Shirlyn is the best person to ask ask if she's free to help set it up if shes not I can do it just made a PR and requested ur review	ok sounds good thanks justin i texted shirlyn will let u know what she says julia is basically done she said asked her to put in a PR jianna has some stuff mixed up on her PR but she hasn't texted me back about it yet also r u LAing 6.004????
yeee wait how'd u k	Checked the member list on the LA repo I'm LAing too
Ooooh Ya I just signed up today	To LA?
Ye	Oh what cool
Were you able to merge the branches for spectacle?	merged julia and mine's in just now jianna has the fix hers and jack doesn't have a pr in yet just texted him to ask
ok awesome i assume the backend is done right? I'm gonna start working on actually calling the backend	Uhhh so it's basically done but idk the stuff jianna put in a PR for is all jumbled and o don't think it works I think she forgot to move some stuff around so she'll fix it this weekend
Ok Which backend section is working / did u work on again?	project routes
Yo any updates on spectacle?	Jack said he can get his final stuff in Tuesday wednesday Jianna hasn't been responding to my texts and I'm not back 9n campus yet once jianna gets her pr in will you be able to pull info to populate the manage team drop down? shirlyn can't get quill sso to work until she whitelists the url we're hosting spectacle on do u have a tent place we can host it
Oooh I can create a heroku for it	Shirlyn put localhost on for now So we can see if quill sso works shirlyn got the quill sso to work but it redirects to the login/success page with nothing on it when u go back to root though the login button reappears i think it's because the user is not being updated on a successful login
Oh ic Ya that should be easy fix tho	Ok awesome
When do u want the arduino? Do u have tap access to the techx office?	Yes I think so Should I just go grab them
yeet they're in abox on the couch just check to make sure there's an arduino uno inside there are two boxes with starter kits, the one on the couch should be the one with arduinos inside	ok i'll ask u if i can't find it
oof also would u mind helpign out a desperate gonzo in the slack if u are free rn while ur at it	oh mb i was going to head there around 130
Lol all g I think he got help	how do you put the token in the http request for jwt
Oh right	about to test with jianna's
"just to clarify, u put the JWT where it says ""this is where the jwt goes"" lol"	how do i get the jwt though
"Oh uhhh in server/auth/views it sets the access cookie as a jwt token on the frontend try logging in and then go to the dev tools (Fn+F12) go to the ""Application"" tab it should be stored under ""Cookies"""	as access_token?
so its stored as a cookie on the frontend side, and the frontend has to attach this token to all requests in order to access the backend ya uhh probably idk but try it in Postman	ok will do ok wait we're trying it with the headers but it doesn't appear to be working
mmm can i see where you grabbed the jwt in ur browser	jianna is sending it to u now
are you getting 403 errors	justin jianna's signed out of quill but spectacle maintains the sign in when she goes to login/success it doesn't do anything she has a print after set_access_cookies but nothing is printing
hmmm ok i'll take a look tomorrow? not sure if i can debug this remotely	OK sure thanks not sure if you're up rn but can u sign into spectacle real quick with your email oh jk you were active way long ago dw about ok i've tested/fixed jianna's endpoints pushed to master
oop	lol
hmm quill_sso doesn't seem to be working	on postman? or just in general  hey justin
Yo	do u remember where u put the laptop charger the dell one i think it's mine
Ya	was it at the table outside
Its on the desk in techx lounge	ok thank u
Yeet	wait it's the pic u sent in the chat right
yee	does this mean we're having a meeting tmrw
Yea Oh oops was that not clear	ok i moved the hack calendar meeting time to tmrw
Amazing thank you Btw I've been talking to other hackathon dev teams Treehacks also hates devpost	oh beautiful that's what i like to hear value add ++
apparently they've contacted Devpost specifically requesting better features like better CSV export but apparently Devpost has only 3 ppl on their dev team	sadd
who are not really working on features	do they need the csv export because of gavel
ya also to check which hackers have submitted projects so they can give travel reimbursement this yr they added an extra layer so after you submit to ur devpost, u also submit ur devpost link to their own site submit.treehacks.org in order to link the hacker with the project but indeed i think a lot of hackathons would want an alternative to Devpost	hmm ok that's good then
yoo i have BIG PLANS there's so much work to be done for HackDev we got lotsa potentijal hopefully we can execute on them	LOL I AM EXCITE
i'm ready to burn out for hack this semester lmao	oh no no burning out is allowed here please no
also if you make co-director pls stay on dev ;)	aww yes ofc i was tlaking to jack about this and like dev is still what i would really like to do aha speaking of which i need to write my platform for elections oop
When is it again	march 2 i believe? or i have to get smth to him by then and then the weekend is platform 5 minutes is a long time to give a speech
Ooh good luck Both u and vishruti will b great	haha thanks justin :)) are we taking 2 devs or more
unclear lol it depends on if some of them are overlaps with other committees potentially if so we can take more	right many of them
we can't take many pure devs	are just dev on the list
ya	just hillary isn't and they like hillary out of the pure devs i only see michael or mindy fitting strongly the rest all kind of fall under the same bin to me
oh mindy is also logs	oh right so then just michael on pure dev
hmm ya	but i'm not really sure like if i think about it broadly these are the standouts
i like Michael a lot, but also Johan has a lot of dev experience	oh i missed johan yeah
I think Raymond, Richard and George are kinda out imo	right
Kat Huang is anotehr conversation	yeah that is hmm
and Johan is a maybe bc of his experience. personality wise he'll fit in but won't stand out oh i forgot Dylan hes also out i think for Dev	yeah i think we've narrowed it significantly then
"Hello,

Thank you for your application to TechX. We had a very competitive applicant pool this year, and after tough decisions, could not offer you a spot in TechX.
We really enjoyed getting to know you through info sessions, applications, and interviews, and really appreciated the enthusiasm you showed us. 

If you're still interested in TechX, we highly recommend you apply during Spring recruitment or next fall -- quite a few people do get in later on. We wish you all the best of luck with the your school year!

Best,
Ramya"	justin do you want to talk to me about consolidating tasks
Ya. R u free after after dev meeting today?	well i have a startlabs management meeting and jack also wants me going to md elections so i still don't know how that's going to work out yet
Oooh Ok hb after general	down
hello lmk if ur free anytime before 1 AM tonight otherwise we can meet some other time	What Uhhh Some other time pref
ok i'm free tomorrow after 3 pm basically	oh wait i basically don't have class tmrw i can do 3pm your assassins target is allen chen - check go/assassins for the rules, starts tonight at 12am
aightt	hehe
yall better change the items regularly lol especially if ppl r not killing eachother	uhhhhhhhhhh how long will this take but ok how about at next general we change it
ya i mean weekly is fine i have lotsa item ideas	text me/jack if you have any contested kills, but otherwise if you kill someone just have them pass on their target to you ok
yee sounds g good job btw! first general as codirector	at general? lol it was low stress today and fun
lol true	:DDD
Dev kiddos becoming directors waow both u and Jack actually all the past directors have been logs or CR	amazing lol justin i have a q what did u write your personal website in
I might have an a Oh it was just javascript and css But I copied a lot from a bootstrap css template I found online	ooh ok i have nothing to do for like the next week
Lolol	while i self isolate so i figured now would be a good time to learn react and make a website or smth
Mm good thinking The online official react tutorial is actually pretty well written I think	yeah i'm working my way through it
The tricky part for me when I was learning react is, Reacy conventions changed a lot very quickly throughout the last few years So you'll see different ways of doing things in different codebases and itll feel confusing	oh right i remember gary told me this when he first taught me too oop
I.e. hooks, completely optional and r a new thing I learned react before they became popular so I still dont prefer to use them But you'll see them around Same with the function vs class definitions	oh i see hm i will make my way through this tutorial
Yee good luck!	JUSTIN I JUST WATCHED GO/JUSTIN AND I AM DEAD WHY DOES YOUR VOICE SOUND DEEPER IN 9TH GRADE THAN IT DOES NOW
LOL BRUH why u do this	"LMAO I""M SO SORRY IM ACTUALLY JUST DYING RN"
I think I was sick or smthn But SAD	justin youre such a fucking g 9th grade you was lit
Did u just discover it	was going through starterpacks
Lol why r u watching it now 	never thought to check
Oh lmao	ok wait actually though
Goddammit It was definitely Jack	do u know where our pictures from hack 19 are SO AMAZING
Uhhh nah I actually dont Probably ask someone on logs?	ok cool lmao i'm just looking for the one pic we used for recruitment this spring
Oooh ya Actually look on drive Its probably there	yee i was looking around there haha
yo are you completely blocked Thursday nights	that's when i usually have 6.08 lab i left it unfilled because we usually get assigned lab partners to work with during our sections and i'm not sure if they're still doing that yet but i don't want to accidentally flake on a partner
ok when do you think you'll find out if thats actually happening?	the phrasing is weird on piazza but i think it's still happening like usual is it because u want to do a thursday evening dev meeting i can't remember if i put it but i can do 10pm onwards
Thursday or Tuesday ya lol oh ok perfect	usually earlier if i work fast in lab haha
ya i was thinking 10 on Tuesday	oh that works yeah sorry i didn't put that first
ya nw yo are there any spectacle starter tasks that you think are self-contained	hmm maybe what kind are u looking for flask or react stuff so perhaps the search bar could be self contained just taking all the project cards and filtering by search actually that might be a bit hard to search the project cards i think a lot of things can be done on the submit form like modifying the checks on those to be better or adding in more options for tracks centering the spectacle logo
checks as in data validation?	yes if that's smth u wanna do i can ask jack what he did so far and what he still wants to get done jianna also spent some time over spring break working on spectacle admin panel it's on her own branch rn and idk how tested it is so adding like a timer/submission deadline things can be an option too
ooh ok that might work uhh which branch is that?	ok so that's a good question lol i remember her telling me she pushed some changes to an incorrectly labeled branch so like i'm looking at her commit history and i think jianna/newuserbackend
hmm do u k the state of the branch / how complete she is with the admin panel bc merging back in might be messy if we have a newbi like branch off of her branch	Yeah how many do u need/when do u need it by I just texted her To gauge the state of it So she'll probably respond by tn
hmm i wanted to send out the starter tasks soon, like this afternoon is jack's form submission code merged in	Yes
ok would u mind checking how much data validation Jack did and maybe come up with a starter task description for that? i can help after i do the other starter tasks	go/spectacle-starters lmk if smth doesn't look right
ok awesome thanks! im gonna use the first 5 tasks as starter tasks and I'm gonna say they can reach out to you with any questions, especially about setup and the structure of the project	On shre Sure* Yee sounds good hi justin the 608 website is down so joe is trying to fix it but i probably won't be able to start for a while and will therefore be late to dev tn
oh ya Shirlyn also told me about that nw	f lmao jk i'll be there
ok sounds g lol poor joe	:(( some kid in our class wrote a script to F5 the page over and over around open time
oh bruhhhh how do u k lol	6.08 gc whole thing blew up while the site was down
i heard its take home now?	yeah i think they may be changing the questions/format tho
ah rip	L
i feel bad for JOe he doesnt deserve this :')	ik he's been really nice to us Happy birthday justinnn
yoo thanks!!	How r u celebrating :')
By not dying :') I'm literally not lol I'm just gonna stay home and eat noodles with the fam	nooooo ok noodles is good ig yeah stay home is the move but do something with an above average fun level
Homemade birthday boba!	oh shooooot that's actually niceeee wait it looks so good like standard boba wow
Above average fun lol	LOL i guess boba should be considered above average now :((
Lol ya Damn I was gonna try to get really good at making boba this semester	it is good Lol my internet just cut out on my laptop I think I need to restart the router so that might take a while :pp will take a look at meeting notes later
lmao ok nw	anything u want on the agenda for beg meeting tn
Ooh Uhhh Structure of a beginner workshop, level of difficulty, who runs it, what kinds of workshops r actually helpful for learning, beginner track/prize? Should the framing of it be: u attend the beginner workshop series for good part of the event, and submit a proejcy as brginner OR these workshops will get u up to speed asap and u submit as regular hacker These r my ramblings lol	oh word i'll copy it in and we can sift through it hop on hop on
Oh Shoot one sec	Should tomato soup actually be considered asoup Or butternut squash soup Aren't these things more like zhou
Lmao where is this coning from Nah because in a structural purist I think soup should be defined by the averge size of paritculates in the substrate The exact size constraint can vary based on ur own religious inclinations But for me tomato soup doesnt cut it	ok good that was kind of the answer i was looking for i couldn't fall asleep and then i watched this cooking video and she kept saying butternut squash soup and i was like hmm is it
LOL Ic oh wait Happy Birthday!(?)	Hiiu Yes Was yesterday Thank u very much haha
Oh dang Did u do anything fun?	I ate food Lots of food It was fun
Lmaoo Thats g Are things open where ur at?	Probably not my parents haven't even let me go on a drive since I got back
Lol ya same Theyre super paranoid about it I had to argue with them to not wear a mask while jogging Even tho i live in a suburb where theres barely any ppl	LOL yeah it's a fat rip a lot of people in our sub have been taking walks these days so there's a lot of people outside what's the planning look like for judging scheduling lol
scheduling wise I think its two hrs for expo judging? and somehow it will happen in parallel with sponsor judging but exactly how is undetermined I think those were the conclusions from scheduling meeting but i had to leave early	ok yeah are u going to be at judging today i think we should try to decide what judging approach we'll do we can send out the judging sign up etc etc
Ye i will Espcially simultaneous sponsor and expi might be hard Like i get why it would be better from a scheduling pov but not surr if it will run smoothly	right yeah i'm not sure either
Bro how do u use windows cmd Why is windows cmd so sad	Bro I don't use it It is Really sad What do u need to do Ever since I got the Ubuntu WSL I've been doing everything on there instead
Wait r there any issues with using ubuntu wsl on windows And can u run windows programs using ubuntu wsl?	The one that's kind of annoying is that it's mounted in kind of a weird spot but like I think it can Oh yeah I just checked it can
Oh nice Ok Ya every time i have to type 'dir' instead of 'ls' a part of my soul dies	LOL Fr everything about it is just Not fun Doesn't power shell use ls Alternatively u could use powershell
Whats the difference Oh ic	Yeah it's supposed to be more powerful it has these things called cmdlets that can execute a lot of different functionality Idk why I'm pubbing it lol
	U can make judging this Friday 8pm right
Okay, that’s alright, See you there	Yeah thanks so much kade lmao
Hey jamie, did you see the teams sheet? it looks like they have shuxin's kerb twice, and donalds isn't on there. I just want to confirm that the file you sent has donald's kerb on it so that it can get changed	Yeah yep
Okay, i'll message the group and see if donald has already messaged joe Hey Jamie, are players usernames associated with the game that they are in? i know donald and shuxin mentioned something about lobbies	no, i think for now they're only running one game at a time so it's just username and user_id
Okay, and are you storing information with usernames or user_id? Is there an endpoint to get all of the usernames/user_ids in the game? What does the orange on the backend spec doc mean lol	i just made them orange bc that's what im trying to get done for milestone 2 i'm storing user_id for prompts and data so u should send the request with a user_id
Okay, but soon i can send a get request to /users.py and get a list of all of the users and their associated uuids?	yep is that important for how u are sending data up
Okay perfect, We just don't want to make the user have to type the whole username out, so i'm going to have the ESP get all of the usernames and uuids, then the user can select their username and the ESP will know what UUID to send up with their data So the user should never see their uuid	oh u don't want them to see their uuid? you could also probably hardcode the uuid as well but your way makes bettere sense
Isn’t the uuid pretty long and gross?	it's about 30 characters so not too bad let me get that users.py endpoint up for u by tomorrow tho shouldn't be bad to implement
Are you working on any server files rn?	ah yes mb i'm currently modifying user.py and score.py shuxin and donald have been asking me to make some changes to how the responses are returned which makes sense since i should be returning json objects as responses
Okay, things changed suddenly and i just wanted to make sure it wasn't something i did to the ESP code	ohhh yeah no it's me haha sorry about that
No problem lol	do u prefer the responses as json objects as well i can make a new endpoint for your purposes if you wsant
I think it will be easier to have a separate endpoint because the esp will only be able to parse it as a character array so the less extra characters the better Because the only user information we need is the pairs of userIDs and usernames	ah ok i can do that p easily alright users_esp.py is up
Okay, thanks jamie! We just were able to get a drawing mechanic that is pretty reliable, albeit low resolution, if you want to check out the 09.png drawing. The plan is to remove duplicate point collection so that we can ramp up the sample rate Awesome!	ah ok that looks super cool
do you mind if i edit data1.py to debug our esp post request? I only need to return what data you are receiving before it is processed into the png	oh do u just want to the data back yeah i'm on the server making changes rn and i have it open i'll just do it real quick
Well when i send data from the esp it only draws a single pixel, but from postman the drawings work, so i'm wondering where the disconnect is its almost certainly in the way that we set up the post request, but i haven't been able to figure out where	oh ok yeah let me send the data back to u it should return back the data you're sending up now
Okay, thanks	yep
Yeah so only a single measurement gets sent, do you think its because we split with ampersands?	what i'm returning is just what you've sent prior to any processing at all i'm currently splitting your data by the & symbol so maybe it's the way you're formatting the request up
can you return the whole request right quick?	yep done
okay so the data makes it	oh nice so what do u think might be the issue then
"The problem is from the esp the html treats the ampersand as the start of a new item parameter so it does 'data': 63,62, 65,66:"""", 67,69: """" etc so only the first pixel is associated with the data key let me try something"	wdym the html wait can u not take the encoding from the etch n sketch and modify it a bit
I didn't do etch a sketch lol, but i can look into it. So basically when we form our body, we are just taking an x and y value separated by a comma and tacking on an ampersand, but when the html reads through that to split up body parameters, it treats the ampersands as the start of a new parameter So if we send up a json formatted body request, it will work?	i can send u my code
I can just copy it from the server oh you mean for etch n sketch	yeah here's my html which has way better documentation it also includes how the data points are being sent up
Okay i'll compare to what i have tried and get back to you	they're also tacking on ampersands but idk how they're doing it we didn't have to write that part ok sg lmk tmrw i'm gonna knock out now haha
Sounds like a plan lol Okay jamie, I think the easies solution is just to change the delimiter to like the percent sign or something. Donald and Shuxin never  Post to data, so that shouldn't affect them, right?	No that's completely OK w me Percent sign then?
Okay, yes, and I'll let you know if that solves our problem	i've made the change if u still need to make any changes feel free to make them from the server if i'm not available i have a few back to back meetings today
Okay i'll copy things from the server to local and add them to my section of the server to test before making big changes if needed	sure that sounds good to me i also built an endpoint last night for displaying images directly on a browser so u don't have to mount the server on smth where u can view the images it's just show.py user_id as param
okay, sweet	are u posting all data with ? as the delimeter now i can change it for u in guess1.py for when u start posting handwriting
Yes	k
what endpoint do I use to add a username?	get /prompt1.py gets a prompt and adds user to db
okay, thanks	yep
If i do that i don't get that user returned from users_esp.py	oh shit let me check smth real quick i moved the tables over to prompts_table but maybe i didn't change users_esp
Okay, np	actulaly all the information is being stored in scores_table if you want to put smth in there u can post /score.py with user_id and username i think that'll do the trick cuz stuff in prompt1.py won't get populated until scores_table is populated based on the website flow
I just need somewhere to get all of the active usernames in a game	yeah post /score.py with add a user to the game i thought we planned on that happening on the website tho like you have to enter your name on the website first
Okay, i understand. We do, theres just no sample data in the table rn to play with	ohhhhh yeah got it
So the ESP won't start until it has usernames to show	oh rip ok
Its all good, i didn't notice anything because all of the work i've been doing has been offline	ah i see yeah sorry i've been making a few changes on the server endpoints for shuxin and donald so just lmk if there's any changes i've made that mess it up for u guys
Okay, will do, no problem I keep getting this error when i try to use guess.py	have u tried guess1.py guess.py is my deprecated version
Oops I meant guess1	i think it means that no annotations are getting returned by the response meaning it's not detecting any handwriting
Okay that is what I expectd	yeah i should make htat a try except
I will see if I can get a response from it in the meantime	yeah let me take a look later tn i have to do smth rn but i'll also take a look at the image u posted to see what it looks like on the server
It isn't the one from the server, but I'll get one on the server	Oh it should have saved the image u posted to a guesses folder on the server tho
I just copy pasted data into postman	Wait what do u mean Like anything u data u post to that endpoint should save as a png onto the server
okay	how are u guys doing the demo for this week's milestone been talking to shuxin about how to demo it all
So I can draw pretty well, and it’s humanly legible most of the time, but the api struggles to return any writing at all Like one out of 10 is a word, but it’s yet to be the right one	ooof hmm i mean as long as it's starting to be words then i thnk that's chill
Yes, if worse come to worst, my idea is we just have whoever drew the picture write down what their prompt was And then have them choose between pictures	i see yeah we'll probably have to make that tweak next week if we need it
Agreed This is the current setup	oh wow fascinating lol thats p cool that looks good
That’s me writing the word peel, google thought it said peci	oh rip lol
I know	that's kind of close tho that's really close actually can we connect something to the esp that can transfer base64 encoded images cuz i was thinking
It is, I’m still playing with it, potentially could make progress. The trouble comes when we have words like “volleyball” that are quite long to write	right idk if there's anything we can use to get really short nouns but if we had something that could take pictures and send those up we could still use the vision api and that would be ind of cool i think it's a little late for extra hardware tho
I agree, I just don’t know if it would get shipped in time But i will look into it	also i pushed milestone 3 html to the repo
We could screen what is returned from the prompt request and only return it if it’s under a certain length	feel free to pull that one
Okay, I’ll get started	oh that could be cool but your guess isn't constrained to what the actual prompt is either like if it was volleyball i could just submit ball as my guess although it's less likely for that to be guessed then lol
True, and then we can’t really distinguish duplicates	yep
If we can’t do that we might have to move guessing functionality to the website What'd you and shuxin decide to do for the demo?	Oh uh we didn't he hasn't texted me back yet
Okay lol I just didn't know if you needed something from me I'll fill out our part of the milestones like normal	Oh yeah I mean maybe u should text shuxin presumably needs data from the esp
Okay, I will	another option for making the guesses better is by connecting every single pair of points together as a line
I suppose I could make it so that every time you let go of the button it inserted some preset character so you knew it was the end of a line, and then you could connect every pair of points between these characters	well because it also detects cursive better i was thinking for ease you could just leave it and i'll just process adjacent points as long as u draw it cursive style then it'll connect the right pair of points
Oh okay, I’m sure it wouldn’t hurt to try	i can make the relevant changes now and you can give it a shot whenever u feel like it today?
Yes, let me know when you get it finished and I’ll test it out	looks pretty clean try it out i'm returning the entire reponse from the api as well so you can see if it's detecting anything at all
Okay so I think this is a better way to represent both the writing and drawing, but I'm not getting great responses in cursive, just because of how sensitive the IMU is, its not as clear as block print. If I send like an exclamation mark, or maybe !,! whenever the button goes from pressed to unpressed, can you stop the line connection? this is what i got for skate	Yeah that looks p good were u still getting no text detected I can stop the line connection but I noticed that in the test. Image that the API sends up it's also in cursive so wondering if it would perform better
It was detecting it sometimes just not correctly	Ah rip ok
Well I think regardless this is a better way to do pictures, so if you could add that functionality to that script you can also implement it in the data1 endpoint as well	Okay sure I'll make this change there too And also u can try the adding exclamation points And I'll figure out a way to split lines
Okay, otherwise I could choose an arbitrary number so that you can continue to split them the same but just check if its this set of x, y coordinates, like 1000,1000 something that is off the screen I can do it that way so you don't have to change how you split the incoming data	I think it'll be not too bad Why don't u try it with the exclamation marks First and I'll see if it works
Okay I actually have to do it to be 1000, 1000 because I can't mix characters and ints in an array which is how we are storing the poitns	is it exactly 1000,1000 or is there a spac
It’s like a normal point but with 1000s. So 1000,1000	ok so no space in between right just trying to see how i should split
Right	alright relevant changes made to data and guess
Did u guys have poster presentation sessions at sstp	Yeah
Did u guys have the Australian lady	For what
Poster session	As a judge?
No for the seminar things	No idea what seminar you're referring to lol
Wait u guys didn't have those???	Uhhhh idk what a poster session seminar is
We have seminar class things were this Australian lady talks to us about how to make a poster	Oh U had me confused I thought u were talking about the actual poster session Uhhh We had ihrig and mahatmya Or smth like that
Well we have those too	Okay yeah no clue
They're so boringgggggggg And she has a thing about circles?	Dude no clue lmao
I'm not sure what they're supposed to be for She mostly just tells us to put circles on our posters	That's Nice Lol Did u text me just so u could share this fascinating bit of information Because it is indeed fascinating
Well it was mostly to see whether or not I should follow her advice But I'm glad u find it fascinating lol	Nobody gives about circles If she wants u to tho I guess U can It doesn't really matter
Ok Did u guys do improv classes	Yeah Super fun
Ugh Our improv classes have become roast sessions lol And this one dude who keeps talking about eating dogs We're an interesting bunch	That is interesting lol
Did u guys have to work with the writing and art kids Sorry I'm just mad that Jans making us do things but also not letting us do other things and it's kinda dumb	Uh No Lol That's just the program man It could be way worse
I mean yea But still The art kids are weirdddddd Also I found a drama called Pinocchio idk if you've already watched it I only on episode 8 but so far it's good	Lol don't be mean to the art kids Dude that was the first drama I watched The girl pisses me off But whatever I made it through the whole thing
Oh lol nvm then Did u think it was good Other than the girl lol	Yeah I thought it was good
 Yo can u look over my poster And make sure it doesn't suck too much	sure send it to me i'll take a quick look
Yayy thanks What email	jamie.fu@gmail.com
Ok I sent it	have you had your mentor look over it yet
Yea	what'd they say
They said it was fine	interesting that your research objectives is that long box at the top i feel like you'd be better off moving it to the first column there's a lot of white space there rn
On top of the spark and Illumina box?	yes number your references and superscript where you used those references throughout the poster
I did parenthetical citations	oh okay that words too personally i would change the arrows to bullet points for a more professional look what's your text box font size rn put the table 2 caption underneath the table
30 pt Okk	and if possible bold or highlight the numbers you want to talk about in that table did u primarily do lab work or data analysis
Both but mostly data analysis	okay that makes sense
She told me to include both	is she a prof or a grad student oh looks like she's a student
Grad student	from your title in your middle validation box make your diagrams bigger and your text smaller you'll primarily use those to explain in your presentation anyways
Lol could u elaborate on the title thing So what size for text	oh no i was just saying i could tell taylor was a student from your title on the poster just smaller doesn't matter what size as long as the diagrams are the focux
Ok What's the lowest I can go to	eh like 28 is fine i still think
Cuz I wanna make sure u can still read them	the red circle in the same box preferably make it solid not as interesting but more professional
Okk	you have a lot of white space in the middle bottom box i think you make the diagram a little bigger i don't think you need to bold some of the vocab words if you want to bold you should probably choose to bold entire sentences that show the main point of your poster like maybe in your conclusion or smth in most professional posters even tho people use bullet points everything is in complete sentences as well for the most part but i don't think u need to change that but the bolding is somewhat erratic imo so maybe opt to just bold single bullet lines instead of words while they may be helpful for u it seems like kind of everywhere other than that it looks good
Oh geez now I feel insecure about my poster Thanks tho Also About the research objectives thing	no it's fine really lmao i'm just being kind of nitpicky lmao don't change anything u don't feel comfortable changing
My main purpose for putting it on top was so that it wouldn't be lost since people are more focused on the top of the poster and I thought it was important but at the same time it does look a bit out of place? So Should I keep it or put it on top of the spark bix *box	it's incredibly skinny tho whereas everyhing is more boxy everybody reads left to right anyways you can move it to the top of the first column and bold all the words in that box if that helps i'm fairly certain that's what i did for both my posters too
Okkk Thanksssss!!!	yeahhhh
"Hey would u mind looking over my research brief as well Also I realized I made a mistake in my poster when I was squishing down one of my diagrams the text box got too small so it continued on the next line so now instead of ""repeat"" it says 
""repea
t"" ahghhhhhhhhghh but I already submitted and it was due yesterday at 11:59 so I can't fix it :(((( But yea can u look over my research brief Mostly for conventional stuff but I'll take any suggestions Helloooo Can u read over my thing Or are u busy rn If ur busy then nvm u don't have to read it Well u don't have to read it anyways if u don't want to But I would appreciate it very much :)"	Oh hey Sorry I just got up from this huge nap Sure u can send it
Lol nice	I'll glance over ot
Yayy thanks Ok I sent it I haven't looked over it a million times yet so I'll change things soon	Do u need to indent the research objectives paragraph
I wasn't sure since it was only one paragraph But should i do it for consistency	Yeah In think so Not sure to
I'll do it	Results
That's what last year people did	First line Indel?
Insertion or deletion	Did u explain that earlier
It was in methods but I didn't explain it Cuz space It's a pretty common term in genetics so I wasn't sure if I needed to explain it?	Maybe not then Ask your mentor? Have you discussed with her the conclusions and implications section to I think u can try to expand the range a by I'm not sure what invalidating the indel means But ig u can hypothesize more?
Space is prohibiting most of that But I'll try	Your second sentence about time being wasted
I sent it to my mentor but she hasn't replied yet	Is pretty clear from your first sentence Oka syeah talk to her about that section in particular tmrw
It's due tonight	Oh hmmm Yeah he second sentence about one u don't need
Ok	U also use further quite often In he second paragraph of that section it
Synonym?	Yeah sure I doN rememvwr Van u change the references to a smaller font Is that allowed Probably nog
Nope	Oh well
I wish	It looks pretty good Dwai The paper at this moment isn't too important It just goes in the booklet
Do u know how they score it Like is it just completion	They dont lmao Yea completion
Fair enough they have like 2 days Do u know how they grade class participation I may have done work during class a few times And didn't do a good job of covering up Also I used the name of an online tool Is that italicized or no or something else	Where What U just have to answer questions in class No biggie
Okk Thankssss!!	Ye
Ayyyyyyy	Very nice very nice Congratulations!
Wait one did u get *which	Same one
Eyy nice I'm following in ur footsteps lol Minus a few accomplishments but it still counts	Lmao no You do u
Lol thanks U have good footsteps tho lol	I have no idea what I'm doing lmao
Welp neither do I	that's life
 Did u apply to rsi Out of curiosity	Yeah ha I was rejected
Oh oof ok thanks	Lmao yeah Just go for it if u want
Yea a bunch of us are gonna apply	Lolll Good luck
Thanksss Do u have any act prep books I can borrow Or did u use any	Just he official one But it's outdated
The red one? So not Barron's or princeton or anything Can I still borrow urs for extra practice questions	No I just borrowed those from the library Im actually saving it for my brother He started doing some stuff w it and writing in t
Oh ok So did u only use the official one or did u use other ones as well	I used other ones Borrowed from lib
Ok Thanks Belin blank center really perfected their website	Lolllll Nice
Who did u ask to nominate for simons	I think O'Leary and franchi
So there's not like a specific person I have to ask?	oh u mean like the nominate formy thing isn't it just your counselor isn't that what that says
"It just says whoever's doing it ""usually a school research coordinator, science teacher, guidance officer"" But I'll just ask boedeker then Or zelinski I'm kinda confused now that I'm doing ib idk who my counselor is But also I dont like zelinski so imma say boedeker"	yeah sure lol
Should I ask in person or can I just send an email	up to u everything is always better in person tho
Okk Thankss	yessir
I'm concerned So for simons I asked boedeker and she was like sure send me the info But since they have a 2 person per school limit she had to let everyone know about it But also she sent out an email to our grade that said we have several people who are interested, if ur interested lmk and we'll pick the students But also if they already have several people why would they not just pick from those people Also should I be concerned about possibly not being nominated	haha my year nobody knew about this and they sent out info too i think lmao damn it got popular i mean each school is meant to only send one nomination form so i'm assuming they'll just aggregate all their students and pick the most academically best ig? not really sure i mean if you want to ask boedeker to make sure you're being considered i'm sure u can also i think your academic standing is great lmao so i wouldn't be concerned on that end if that's what you're asking
Hmm okie How do I ask without sounding pushy Or like idk if pushy is the right word but like	honestly if you asked her about it she's for sure considering you that's like all u can do right have her consider you
Yea ig Thanks For recs for summer stuff I'm debating between my math teacher and my bio teacher cuz the thing is both of them are relatively new and dont have a lot of senior classes so I'm not sure who to ask. My bio teacher can to speak to my ability in bio well but I've known my math teacher for longer and I'm asking pohlonski for genetics already? Halp?	What kind of research ru trying to do Pohlobski will speak to your character tho So maybe get a teacher that can say how smart u are
Umm lol that narrows it down Genetics but that'll probably be computational? Or neurobiology cuz that's one of the things they listed and I'm good with biochem in general So probably should ask my bio teacher?	Yeah that seems reasonable As long as the teacher likes u and u think they can write well
Ok thankss	Yeah like I think the difference is minimal
Yea probably Do u remember what aps u took sophomore year My friends planning	us bio ab
Thanks Hey do u have any tips for sat reading My English and math are fine it's just reading that's kinda screwing me over And sometimes I dont really understand the explanations	uhhhh i would just say don't overthink it something that's like helpful is if you get stuck between two answers think like what would the sat writer want me to pick even if both seem correct that's how i thought of it anyways like sometimes if u think too hard u keep thinking more answers are possible when they're not
Ok Thankss	yeah np
How did u do in chem olympiad	not that well lol idrc about it tho
Lol ok I was thinking about doing it this year since I dont think it conflicts with hosa But also idk if I'm willing or have enough time to study So I wasnt sure how valuable itd be Also pretty sure I'd be beat by like 30 others kids from novi alone so	Well if u like chem u should go for it Olympiads are kind of big money if u do really well Also big competition tho
Hmm idk I like chem but I'm not super strong in it And I feel like to do well I'd have to study a lot and idk if I'll have time for that But also it might be kinda fun? Eh I'll see when it comes What about amc? I'm also debating on how much effort I'm gonna put into thag *that	Wouldn't know never did it
Hmm ok Thanks For this one should I ask from my sstp mentor as well Or just teachers Is the MSU one Hshsp *it's	Uhhh I don't exactly remember hmm If there's nothing against asking a mentor Then ask a mentor
Ok thankss When it says choose two fields of research that are distinct How distinct should they be	Well it might be good to separate the two fields to broaden the range of interests u have Unless u know what u want to do
"I mean I kinda know the area I wanna do But like When u say broaden the range of interests do u mean like completely separate fields like one in chem and one in bio or like Ig when it says ""research field"" how specific is that supposed to be"	I'm not really sure either Usually the more specific u are the more knowledgeable u sound g Ig But don't close off any opportunities by being I only want to work w this specific type of yeast or whatever
Lol ok thanks Question So I kinda failed psat And I'm kinda sad about that But like for summer program apps should I put this years as well Cuz I kinda went down from last year But it also might be a little sus if I just put 10th grade?	They don't really care that much about test scores Just put your best It's nbd In the long run it won't be a big feal but seriously tho katie don't worry you're gonna be a ok
Yea ik Still kinda sucks ;-; I actually managed to get perfect in math and writing then reading screwed me over Ig its not as bad as my other friend that got a 460 in math lol I think he did something wrong on his scantron	Oh Sad
Question Sorry ik I'm asking a lot about school and testing So I took the act yesterday And I'm realizing now that I got like 2 possibly 3 wrong on the reading which puts me at a 33 or 32 On reading idk about other subjects But on the other act I took I got a 36 on reading Ik mit superscores by subject but other colleges look at composite which best case scenario would be a 35 Should I retake it just for that reading score	Have u already taken the act twice
Yea	Literally there's no difference between a 35 and a 36
Ik	Like anything above a 33 colleges really don't care So like My recommendation would be to Put your efforts elsewhere
Ok then My mom gonna yell at me for reading lol	Meh that's alright Long run it won't matter Well I'm sorry that she's gonna tell at u Yell at u But Don't take it again just cuz of that
Yea ok I might be screwed in math tho I read the reddit comments for the test but I feel like they're just making me more anxious	Lop Stop reading them then Dwai seriously There are more important things in life School College admissions The whole sheband
Is sheband a word	Shebang
Oh Is that an actual word Ope it is	Lol Ok
Question How do I write an essay for summer program apps Like how do u approach it	depends on what they're asking btw do u know if anyone got into any ivys ea this year
For the ones that are like explain why you're interested in these topics Also the ones that are like what's a time u used problem solving And umm I havent heard anything yet But also it usually takes a while for these things to get to me so Probably not the best person to ask	hmm ok well wdym how do u approach it ig just like brainstorm just possible topics first and then see which ones are the best
Like	and try to write about why u find meaning in it ig
Do I emphasize why I'm interested or like what led me or like what I'm doing currently or like Idk Idk really what I'm asking if I'm just not very good at writing these kind of things?	all are fair game as an answer they're pretty open ended about these things just write about what you think is important to u give it a shot first i think what you've just said is nb
Nb?	not bad
Ah ok For some reason i thought of no bueno and was confused	???? lmao
Lol I'm not very fluent in texting	lol that's just funny tho
Wait so for applications where the rec form is separate from the application it's ok if recs submit before I submit right	Yeah most likely
"What should I include when they ask about long range goals Like outside of career goals Should I be like ""I wanna go to this college that ur affiliated with"" lol"	Uhhhhhh No Not really Just like professional goals
Ok Thankss What kinds of things should I include when they ask about extracurriculars Also how was vegas Did u win any money??	Wdym by this question Like I would just list all your ECs u think are important and relevant
"I mean like the question is ""describe ur participation in extracurricular or community outreach activities"" For one of the personal statements So should I like list them or should I pick a few and talk about them"	Yeah describe it Talk about what it is and your roles and stuff
"Ok So just the ones related to my abilities as like Idk a smart person Then also ""what activities demonstrate your leadership, creativity and uniqueness"" Some of it overlaps with the other question but i dont wanna duplicate Cuz it might look a little sus So what do I do"	Just ones u think important Not necessarily academic Just divide them how u see fit then Fit your activities into those prompts
Ok thanks For the rsi app it says state what u perceive as the one or two most interesting questions in ur research interests. How specific do u think I should be with the questions Cuz rn mine are topic specific but they could be applied in diff ways ig But should I go like research question specific Cuz I'm thinking it might show that ik what I'm talking about and that I'm actually well read and passionate about the subject But on the other hand idk if narrowing my interests would be beneficial Also word count is a thing	that's good doesn't really matter too much in my opinion everybody writes their apps in diff ways final decision up to u
hmm ok do u have any advice on cutting so i can fit the word limit it's 5,000 characters, but somehow i still managed to go over just like generally things that aren't necessary?	Sometimes shorter is better Cut out extraneous phrases Or things that are kind of repetitive Make it sound artful And that's it
"Ok thankss For questions about problem solving skills should I use examples in or outside of research It says ""u may describe things outside of science"" so they would accept either way Cuz I have a good example from sstp but idk if that might be problematic since I was working with a grad student they might not think it reflects my problem solving skills completely?"	What about the grad student Most undergrads don't even work directly with profs anyways so it's ok
I mean like they planned most of the project out Like problem solving example was a thing that went weirdly and we were trying to figure out why and I did do stuff for that but like in general they told me what to do for the project	i guess i don't really know the context so i can't give u perfect advice but if you haven't talked about sstp yet in your application you should definitely find a spot to do so and elaborate on the technical work that you did i don't knkow if this is the best place to do it but like your application as a whole should be rounded right maybe for problem solving u can mention smth else if it fits like a project that u took the lead on in school or otherwise
Hmm ok Thanks	yeah np
By chance do u still have ur stats notes	I'm not sure I'll check
Okk How do I nicely remind my previous mentor that recs are due soon Like Without sounding Idk the word Rude? Or like not rude but like How to talk to people of a higher authority	Just be like I wanted to ask if there was any other info I can provide And in order for my application to be submitted on time it needs to be turned in by this time And tgat should be good enough
Okie thankss CHEN IS GETTING MARRIED AND HAVING A KID WAT THE HECKCKCKKCJ Je suis shooketh	LMAO YEAH wait I saw it on Facebook lol Did u mean to send this to me lmao
Umm no but Oops Still works tho lol	Lol
question when it says attach a file with ur official test scores am i allowed to use the student score report from the website or do i actually have to send the scores	well when u officially send scores it won't be a file i'm pretty sure that's good or if they mailed u a hard copy that should suffice too
What did u usually do	I think I scanned in my physical forms that they mailed me I think act has a place where u can download a PDF of scores too Maybe sat too
They have a download thing but that gives a student score report And idk if that counts as an official report?	Then that should be fine
"Okie Oh yea today Pohlonski told me she knows the hshsp director And she was like ""yea I usually call in for recs but I remember jamie turned them down before so I hope this doesnt affect ur chances of getting in"" And I was like welp if I dont get in I'm blaming it on u"	Well I don't remember if she called in for me Besides I was waitlisted
Oh Well Ig I cant blame u then if I dont get in	Lol It's okay you'll be a ok Hshsp is a very good program And it's awesome that they run it You know that song by rascal flatts Life is a highway It's because life is a highway And you just gotta ride it all night long
Wow U really just made that reference	I did
I'm not sure how I feel about that	It's good
Is it?	Yes
Whatever u say man for the simons app what type of thing did u do for the one that says what thing shows ur problem solving skills rn i have something from sstp lab written but i feel like it's not interesting or unique like it's kinda boring also i was just kinda doing what my grad student told me like i didn't put that in but i think it's kinda implied so im trying to think of something outside of that but i cant think of anything my problem solving is just kinda working around the problem or dealing with it or asking someone for help	I don't really remember that question But just think about something u achieved that wasn't easy And talk about your process towards that goal
Hmm ok Thankss	Yeah I feel like you've asked me about this already but I don't really know how to help that much either lol
Oh lol maybe Sometimes I ask things then think for a while then forget about them lol Probably not the best thing to do But It gets done eventually lol	It's okay but yeah I would brainstorm a lot of options and try several You'll naturally find the best one
Thankss ok so like talking about the same question problem solving skills question so i couldn't think of anything especially difficult that ive overcome so i had a little story thing about aceing and how chris used to hit his racquet on the ground a lot and how i worked with him on that and he got better my mom says i should do something from sstp last year when i had to learn a programming language before the summer which ig is more practical but also a bit boring imo? but i was wondering what do u think aceing story or learning something quickly for sstp my justification was that a story about aceing might be a little bit more unique my mom said it was thin lol but the sstp thing shows that i can learn quickly which is probably more pragmatic and that might be better since it's a research program?	what have u written so far what topics* you need to show a wide range of things in your application if you've already written about sstp in another question, i would just make sure u include the programming language thing in there and write about something else for problem solving if u haven't you should definitely mention it somewhere i think both are worth talking about but i'd also tend towards the more technical answer to demonstrate your learning aptitude if you haven't written about sstp yet
"i wrote about sstp in the ""describe previous research experience"" one"	did you talk about learning a new programming language there don't repeat yourself in your application i think that's a big thing if you can spread your experiences out that's better
i didn't say it was new but i said i used it	i would include that you learned it as a new immediately before there the prompts are just there to guide your answers you can write your answers however you like include as much detail as possible same for this problem solving one then if you can beef it up i would
wait beef it up with what the problem is the word limits are like 90 so details tend to get left behind	oh ummm yeah i remember this part i honestly just maneuvered my wording until it all fit but make it sound more artful or problem solvy ig i honestly don't even know if you should take my recommendation on this maybe an all technical background that is diverse is better
wait wdym by diverse all technical isn't that like whats the word contradicting things	like a diverse set of technical things that you've done so for example hosa, research, etc.
ohh ok i see so would not technical things not help? Do I leave this blank? Like is it asking about outside of the program?	No inside the program You should personally email a few profs too And then list them here
Ok Wait what should I email them about Like ik to reach out but what do I say	uhhh well you want to do research under them right so i would learn about some of the work they do and ask them to be in their labs this summer as a part of simons
Ah ok Right I see Thanks Sorry I'm being annoying Itll stop in about a month lol But thanks for helping me!!	lol no it's ok ig i didn't know about these things either you're very welcome
Ok so Sorry same question as the last few days Which one do u think is better I'm leaning towards the 2nd one cuz it has more substance ig But my other friend said the 1st one was better cuz its more unique But also I'm not sure if that really matters? Cuz like u said diverse technical skills But What do u think	I'll take a look later I'm in class rn But I wouldn't know honestly Since I can't look at your whole application Its up to u to decide what fits better given your context Right cuz each essay contributes to a whole image So u want it to go well together
Hmm ok Wait how late do ur classes go	Uh I just have this evening class on Mondays and Wednesdays Ends at 10pm I've got a meeting after tho
Wow that sounds tiring	it wasn't too bad i think regardless of which prompt you choose you need to convey this idea of problem solving better liike generally in problem solving there's some sort of process right like identify your hurdle
Hmm ok Thanks	sorry i was going to finish this sentence but like yeah identify the hurdle say how you came up with a solution instead of what your solution was like the how is important right how defines a skill not a what
Oh lol sorry Ok I see I'll do that	wait no i meant my sentence don't be sorry i just had to leave for a sec
Lol ok Thankss	"yeah np also a lot of your sentences read the same way like noun verb noun, preposition noun verb noun first i would recommend taking out the passive language like ""it was difficult"" unless u think it has a special effect and then try to convey things implicitly rather than explicitly like your ""i am proud"" is explicit i guess it's hard to do in 90 words if possible refactor but straightforward is not bad either i think i might have been more straightforward too i remember having less than 90 words it was like 250 characters or smth"
Oof Yea I hate word limits	lol i can't even reach word limits so u have a good problem
Lol For ib We have to write reports for projects for each class Legit spent more time cutting things out of my world essay than originally writing it	well then that's a good thing i gotta go to bed now but good luck
Thanks Thanks for the help!	yep np
for the simons thing where i email profs i want to join how soon should i do that cuz what if it's like they reply the next day and on some off chance happen to say yes but i don't get into the program or i do get into the program but also on some off chance happen to get into rsi or hshsp like ik the chances of this happening are very low lol but like when should i send emails	Asap The point is that by emailing them they go tell admissions that they want u and then u get in The goal is to set up smth wth a prof that way u get what u want and they get what they want
ah ok i see thankss	Yep
Would it be inappropriate to include this as a reason for wanting to join this lab I think it's a pretty darn good reason I mean aside from the whole it matches my research interests and everything Turtlessssssss	lol u should get a feel for how chill it is before saying that start more professional
I found another suitable lab Granted idk what they research But that's a secondary matter	lmao nice
Do u know what kind of tea pohlonski likes	i think earl gray? i can't even remember now lmao she likes the tea that i don't like like british tea
Lol ok thanks I'll just get earl gray	wait i'm not sure
Welp	just make a valiant effor
Lol how do I do that Earl gray and chamomile We went through her tea cabinet lol	LOL nice
Im disappointed in myself I wrote an email to the dude with the turtles And I went through all the research stuff Then I forgot about the turtles I was gonna add like a ps I like ur turtles And I didnt And now I'm disappointed	lol nice is it too late now
"Hmm idk I could send another one with a ps Then he would see both But theres also the chance that he saw my email but ignored it lol In which case receiving ""ps I like ur turtles"" might be weird But ig it's weird anyways So maybe I'll just send another one in the same thread"	omg strange girl
Hey man The turtles are important also i just mailed out my hshsp thing and apparently my mom did priority mail which means itl get there by like friday and it's due on march 1st	Lol damn the application cycles for these are so late Damn
"which means i could've waited another week lol when are they usually some were in like january and so when i was putting everything into envelope i realized i forgot to include my 7th hour in the ""list classes u don't have a grade for yet"" thing so i added it in in pen cuz i don't have a printer and it doesn't look super neat but i was like ""i gotta get this out so it has enough time to get there"" then i realized i didn't need to send it out today so she's gonna look at it and be like the hecc this girl isn't neat and detail-oriented ;-------;"	i would not overthink this
Well Too late But ok	lol ok
Hey ur a techy person right How to I make google docs stop being dumb Ok ik this is not what u do in comp sci But I dont know what to do	Could be your screen size If you're zoomed in or smth Or because u have a table that's not exactly aligned with text
Nah I tried that Wdym by this	Lol like your table is pushing your text doqn Bro idk
Well I think it is something with the table But Idk what And frankly idc enough to figure it out Also it's due tomorrow so I'll just put in a section break	lol ok sure
out of curiosity do u remember what book u wrote about for hshsp	the power what are you going to write about
Oh I already did it lol Lang lang's book Cant remember the title completely Read it in like 5th grade I reread it to write this thing and I realized how good he actually is Played with the chicago phil at 17 Anyways How did u write about it Like what was ur main theme I already submitted my thing so I cant really change it But I'm just curious As to how people think about things	oh can i answer this question later i'm a bit busy atm
yea sure i mean it's not super urgent i was just wondering	Haha OK
Yo I'm at science fair rn And the girl next to me is the one that was next to u 2 years ago	Wait what Lmao Who And how did u mnow
"Maria We were talking and I brought up sstp And she was like ""oh that sounds familiar i think there was another novi girl a couple years ago that did that"" And I was like well nobody in novi knows what sstp is lol So I was like ""was her name jamie"" and she was like ""yea something like that"" And she was like ""her project was something about in vitro fertilization"" And I was like LOL What a coinkidink"	Lmao How does she remember I don't remember anything
Lol idk She seemed smart I mean she is smart But like She seemed very solid with her thoughts Although it's interesting cuz she said she sometimes repeats questions she asks people cuz she forgets she already asked them Yet she remembered someone else's project from 2 years ago Intriguing	Lol I don't know anything about this
Welp This imbalance in recall is also interesting Idk maybe it was just one of those random things she remembered lol	Oh huh Ig I was memorable
wOowW She asked where u go now and I said mit and she was like ... oh dang ok	Lmao nic Do u know her last name By any chance
Uhh Fields I think	Hmm Ok
Not sure if that helps lol	Not really but I feel bad now
Welp Did u contact profs for all of the programs u applied to last year	no just simons
Ah ok I wasnt sure if I shouldve done for others or if that would've helped or anything It's also kinda late so Thought hshsp deadline was also kinda late But I also wouldnt really know who to email They dont list previous projects and stuff like simons	Is it past the deadline?
Lol yea like almost 3 weeks But they usually do the thing where the committee goes over it first then they send to profs And that usually takes a while anyways so I was like eh should maybe i should try? But also idk if hshsp does it that way and idk if they have a set thing of profs that already agreed to mentor Also I was rereading my book from like 5th grade for the essay and it's about lang lang and apparently the boy played with the chicago phil at 17 And I was like Damm	dang nice
Hey do u have any chinese drama recs I wanna learn chinese better lol Not a huge fan of historical dramas tho Did u at some point say put ur head on my shoulder is a good one	Lol well joy of life Is a really good series It looks like it's historical But it's not really It's really funny and one of the best shows in China last year Put your head on my shoulder is hella cringy
Ah ok I'll watch joy of life then	Yeeee
Wait why doesnt the dude take his blindfold off Also I feel like I'm gonna miss a lot of the jokes cuz my two half fluent brain cells wont pick them up lol	It's his thing bro I think u can find some episodes with eng subs
B-but the actor has such a nice face :( Lol yea I'm watching with subs first but theres still some things I dont pick up Like he goes my name is  and says it's annoying but I didnt get it until my friend explained it to me Also I dont like how fb turns emoticons into emojis I want to type colon opening parenthesis not :( Oh damn they really just broke into a dead dudes grave for an anatomy lesson	Lol u seem Invested
Always Also bored Did u do the questbridge scholarship things	nope
Ok I was thinking about it then I was like eh I dont really feel like bugging teachers and zelinski for stuff	i don't ahve a lot of experience with it so i'm not really sure what advice to give u lol
Lol it's fine I probably wont do it I'm done with apps this year  At least until like August or something College apps are coming up :'(((( Je suis scared Also ap and ib testing is wack this year so idk how that's gonna work They cancelled may ib tests but idk if they're gonna make us take november in which case I'll be doing college apps and studying for tests at the same time C'est terrible	damn yeah that sucks
:(( I think I'll just give my emoticons multiple chins so fb doesnt make them into emojis	yeah that's what i usuallydo
RSI died ope	Yepp
Eh I got rejected anyways	:(((
"Lol it's fine didnt expect to get in anyways My other friend was like ""to be brutally honest u should expect to fail rsi"" and I was like...okie"	Oh Sad Sometimes expecting failure is not good
I mean in certain contexts true Sometimes expecting success is not good either	Yes That's true
What does it mean when someones pokes u on fb	Bro idk It's just like a thing people used to do for fun
Huh It sounds Like an invasion of personal space lol	Lol They can't hurt you
true the person that poked me is someone that would poke someone in real life which concerned me a bit	Lol Well U won't be seeing them for a while
That is a good point Sad that I wont get to see the seniors again :((	if it's chill over the summer u could
Oh yea true Hshsp died nooooooooooooo Major sad	awwwwww did u get in michigan is p bad rn in terms of corona so
Idk they didnt say I mean true Ig public safety is Kinda important But I really wanted to go to that one :((((((((	yeah :((( sorry katie have u been looking for stuff to do at umich that's also a possibility
U mean programs or working with profs That could work Also question When u were looking at colleges how did u look at them Like I realized that I really dont know much about a lot of schools And I looked at some websites but at a certain point they all kinda look the same So like What do I do Also I never got to give pohlonski her tea :((	just a prof hmmm i didn't really apply to that many cuz i was like i know anything that's out of state has to be really worth my time so i didn't apply to like columbia, duke, northwestern, dartmouth, penn, etc. even tho they're all very good so i don't know much about those i looked up some stuff on the websites about the colleges i wanted to apply to and their specific programs for things i wanted to do and interesting news i didn't know that much even about the colleges as i was applying though you usually figure out in more detail way later and even after you're accepted by doing campus visits and meeting other students etc etc
ah ok i see ive gotten emails about like virtual campus visits lol do u think those would be helpful btw how many did u end up applying to also slightly unrelated but if you had a kite what would you name it	Uhhhh No clue lmao Like 7 if u count all the UCs as one
huh interesting i feel like im gonna start panicking after ea and just apply to a lot more than i need to	Lol don't apply to anything u wouldn't feel super enthusiastic about going to
lol i mean i just wanna go to a school lmao	lmao katie u should have expectations though of what u want no low bars
lol you're probably right stressful man	be like that
yes it do they also pushed sat back to october fun	damn wsas there an august and sep
Uhh I havent checked but presumably yes? I might end up taking one of those anyways	hmm ok
if you had a kite what would you name it	idk lol why is this a question that exists
thats a good question lmao i'm keeping my brain cells occupied this is the list ive compiled so far lol and kites deserved some dIGnITY *deserve also do u know of any public bio databases not including pubmed. ive been thinking of doing a project on my own since i have time now but idk what to do or where to start	I'm always confused by you Hmmm Well what kind of bio data you want Honestly I think if u just search up what kind of data you want u can find what you're looking for in the results
I dont blame you Do u have a kite name tho? It can look however u want it to	Patricia
Ooh nice What does Patricia look like Genetic data and stuff Oh yea I might try that I think I might have to finesse my way into stuff with my uiowa account assuming it still works It's interesting how journals are meant to be used to share scientific knowledge yet u have to pay a ridiculous amount to access some	She's probably pink or purple and had an obtuse sort of shape As long as u have an edu account u should be good
What's an obtuse shape	somethinig that isn't thin ig idk
ah ok i see i see good kite good kite	yessir
i finished joy of life what the heck was that ending i think this is probably the first drama where i got annoyed at the lead but damn i dont think he deserved that anyways what should i watch next im not sure when i'll actually get to it since i need to make up some work but good to have one in the back of my head	wasn't it so good though wait it's a cliffhanger for a reaosn boi my dad and i both think he didn't really die well he didn;t because there's a seson 2 coming out next year clearly the ending was not supposed to be an ending right uhhhh idk tbh idk any more good chinese dramas but i watch like  somtimes
lmao ik it was supposed to be a cliffhanger but like if he didn't die they why was there a shooting star or maybe he comes back to life in that weird way he did before that i forgot i tend to forget a lot of the stuff they tell us in those storytelling parts where they're like reading a letter or telling someone something even tho that's how the plot moves oops anyways the ending did genuinely surprise me tho i feel like a lot of the twists here were somewhat predictable but that one legitimately caught me off guard waiting for season two nowwwww is this one like a show show i should watch something with my dad he watches old stuff tho maybe ill just watch crash landing on you like my other friend told me have u watched that yet	nope i heard it was good though i'm not really into action romance tho it's a variety show
Ah ok Maybe I'll watch it with my dad or something Also can u tell victor to check his email and respond to me Also where do u watch this	yeah sure lol what'd u send him an email about youtube
We want the middle school scioly results since they actually put in effort for that lol and the teacher isn't responding and he's the only 8th grader ik there lol	Oh huh I don't think my brother knows the results tgo They're not released to us ? I'm not sure
Oh uhh well he sent me something I cant open it tho lol Arent your parents coaches or something	yeah lol what did he send u
Idk An email? It's a link to mail.google something which is the gmail thing And I cant open it so idk Can u tell him to check his email again lol sorry	lol umm i'll just ask my mom if she has any related info otherwise u might just have to keep bugging the coach
Ughh I dont like bugging adults She didnt reply to the first email or the follow up lol	those things usually go to the bottom of their inbox slowly there's no problem w bugging them lol or if u know the assistant coach that could work too but yeha i'll ask my mom later
Lol idk how the middle school system works they're so much more organized and dedicated than we are This freshman came in and is trying to get a head start on everything and told us to do stuff and made forms And I'm like buddy ur good officer material but u ain't an officer yet	yeah ikr they're dedicated
Tis quite admirable But it's also april and I'm lazy lol	eek yeah
"bro this kid the dedicated one is like taking over he's like ""i made a slideshow and plan to present it at the zoom meeting this month"" and we're like wut a) we didn't agree to a zoom meeting this month, b) why did u make a slideshow, and c) why are u presenting it u ain't an officer yet buddyyyyyyyy arghhhhhhhhhhhgghghgh"	Lol idk what's going on lol
lol so u know how i said there's this dedicated freshman that's trying to do stuff for scioly next year. He's like taking over a bunch of things and doing officer jobs when he's not an officer and it's annoying like making presentations and apparently presenting them and making google forms and telling us how we should do things dedication I can understand but filial piety man u don't boss around ur seniors when u don't have authority tho he'll probably end up being an officer next year anyways so he can boss us around them *then	well how can he take over them if hd eosn't know what they are like how is he taking over them like wouldn't your officers be doing their jobs
"Hes like doing our jobs That we should be doing eh it'll be fine he'll end up being an officer anyways and he'll make everything good and we'll all be happy it's just kinda annoying rn ok also i just checked the senior box for the ""what grade are u gonna be in next year"" question on an officer app this is scaryyyyyyyy im becoming an old lady nowwwww aghhghhhghh"	lol almost a new start to your life it'll be interesting
it's scary man also no more upperclassmen to bug actually that's not true phones exist	yeah lol
lol expect me to bug you until im like 30 and have my life together Ayy I got into ssp But also I'm still waiting on 2 others and they're only giving me a 3 day window to commit Agh oh wait it's virtual lmao that should be fun	Oh yayyyyy Congrats I've heard so many good things about ssp I have a few friends at school who went there It's really tight w mit and they're really organized and had a reunion last year What else r u waiting on And which ssp program
ooh that sounds fun bu rise tho they might be cancelling idk they didn't send an email but they're website didn't specify whether they were gonna try virtually like some other ones so idk and clark (texas) $750 stipend sounds mighty nice biochem -- it's a thing about modeling a fungus and entering it into a database then designing an antifungal thing based on its structure which sounds really cool but it's also a group project so it's not super specific to my interests and i can't use it for comps and stuff it still sounds like it would be a really good experience tho	what kind of comps are trying to enter i heard it's a lot of fun although since it's virtual this summer idk i doubt any programs this summer won't be cancelled or going virtual ssp is a very appealing option imo
like science fairs like intel and siemens and regeneron and stuff	siemens has been done for a while that's no longer a com p i think u can apply as a group project for isef and sts tho
true true oh lmao i haven't looked into these things in a while true ig idk i'll see i think regardless it would be a good experience	yeah lmk how your decision goes
yea fs I'm going to ssp whoop whoopppp Clark and bu were both cancelled lol But I'm good with ssp it should be a good experience I was thinking about it and was like I spent so much time doing apps but all but one ended up getting cancelled anyways But I got into the one so that's all that's important lmaoo I didnt get to give pohlonski her tea tho which is sad so I'll probably write her a long sappy email at some point I'm curious to see how online ssp will go Apparently they're having a talent show? Ig the nice thing is I still get to do stuff at home And I might be able to do hosa if it doesnt conflict with anything major Oh yea dude they moved hosa online and made it open note My test is literally just knowing random lines from the books Which for me is good since I forgot to return the books and still have them But it's wack Gonna be hard to place And i think skills were replaced by open ended tie-breaker questions? I am major confused and slightly concerned But good that they made it happen at least	Lmao what Interesting lol SSP is the high profile one anyways do that's good
Yea yea it'll be good I'm exciteddddd Yea it's wack When it comes to tests like this I kinda bank on my ability to remember random words the night before then recognize them since its mc But Guess I cant do that anymore	open book is nicer tho
i mean yea ig it's just gonna be tough to place	potentially yes
:(( I just wanna place at nats lol	:(( you got this
Thanks man Hopefully	:DD
Victor	Lol Yes
wait ok u know those plushies u have like the shiba and the turtle and those what brand is that	squishmallow
Thankss	yep why lol
Because my friend said he'd get me one And I wanted those specific ones Cuz they're cute	haha yes oh who's he they are cute

Lol yea he's been working on card tricks And can juggle now too	oh cool
Not very well lmao	haha learning is a process
True true I haven't sent you pup pics yet have I	omg adorable i'm in love is it a she or he
He He's a cutie boi Also whines at 4am lol	awwwww what's his name he's such a small baby i want a doggo
 do you have any ideas for an english nickname lol yeaaa 2 month baby you should take doggo borrow indefinitely lol I've got my eyes on 5 not my doggo tho don't take my doggo	LOL wow he's a chinese doggo
yea the doggo will be more bilingual than me lmao	lol does it understand chinese
well we talk to him in chinese I'm not sure how much he can understand now but he will learn	i think he might he's a pug right are pugs generally smart
I think they're not super smart but they're not dumb	hmm i see well we'll wait and see
Which Michael	silver isn't playing it's michael lu Is the thing u have to take notes a remarkable
yep it's really nice	Ooh OK cuz they just announced the remarkable 2 so I was thinking of maybe getting that Cuz I like the apple pencil and all but Im not in the apple ecosystem for anything else so idrk everything Idrn*

yeah it's currently being made /list it's a pull request	ohh lit
"""List all clubs"" maybe if there were more devs on the project....."	LOL the concept for the front page is really cool tho are the balls supposed to represent like water molecules in a firehose
yep	ooooh interesting
I spent so much time on the css holy shit	lol it's somewhat satisfying to watch them work their way across the page
yeah it's p funny i talked to jack shortly about it essetntially we need to make sure our virtual club penguin is usefully enough for people to actually consider using it	ah i see hmm yeah i read the docs has engagement been generalluy lower at the hackathons the project submission rate was really different from hackathon to hackkathon tho
much lower we had the same amount of projects instead of 2.5 x	wait wdym 2.5x
2.5x more people for the same size of projects	i'm talking betweeen the diff hackathons u called tho like some hackathons had 100 some projoects for like 200 people and another had like 100 some for like idk i forget now like 600
 can u add this to the slack ty wait jk i got it!	uh ok it's a channel tho wait are we allowed to share channels across workspaces
yes wait can u go to ur settings and approve the channel	wait do i even have admin privileges for hack
who does	rip idk i guess jack anyways i can't access hack's settings is this u lol
?	oh the hack calendar oh is that not
No It’s in Chicago Who lives in Chicago	lol why is chicago less relevant than texas
Lol jk It is me Whoops	...
Thanks for reminding me I have something tomorrow lol	you're very welcome lol good luck

Health is not an issue if you have crippling depression I’m just like super awake	Uhhhh Listen to headspace That one dudes voice is super soothing
Headspace?	Yeah the meditation app Try it They do sleep casts too
Meditation apps are like kinda weird	Wow U really just attacked my culture like that
No no no it’s not like an attack It’s just not for me	Lmaoo
I need it to be hella quiet when I meditate	You're definitely not a meditation guy
Uh	I mean It's 1am Isn't it A quiet Time
But I’m super awake Like adrenaline coursing through my body awake	Dude how I'm so tired This vessel is old and needs it's rest
Gramma you good Do you need help finding your way around again	Lmao It really be like that so.etimes tho Ok I hope I entertained u For a while But Like I said Sleep Calling

Gramma sleep tight I need your help yet again	What's up
I’m bored	Sleep
But I’m not tired grandma	Listen to relaxing rain sounds
Makes me want to go to the bathroom Relaxing but also not relaxing	Forest Campfire
Forests make me anxious about getting lost and campfires are just crackling sounds that’s kinda weird	So You're unwilling to relax
I’m not unwilling it’s just that the world isn’t a relaxing place	At 2am in the morning it better be
Why are you up then	Work
Wait what You work at 2 am? What kind of job	No like workingwork
Where can I apply Oh	I'm working Like Studying
For what	School

Wew used all three brain cells	Lmao Just go to sleep omg
Sounds fun! I think. How’s it going so far?	Not reall Im  behind Whatever
You still have time to catch up! I believe in you grandma	Oh man thanks kevin
No problem Just don’t stay up too late fam sleep deprivation is not fun and neither are the hallucinations There’s no use studying if you start hallucinating during the middle of the test (in my case the apush test)	Agreee I done for the day anyways
You get those rem cycles I’ll just stay here	At least try to sleep alrigbt Gn
Gn gramma Im currently taking personality tests so in a way I’m studying	Hi again Idk about that What's your Myer brggs

Yeah debating is fun As long as it isn’t online	Ha lmao just avoid the comments section
Just select sort by controversial and get the popcorn	LOL I hate reading that shit tho
Yea, it’s usually “controversial” for a reason	I want to comment but know it's so useless so I just argue silently in my head And get all worked up for no reason So I try not to go there anymoee
Lmao same tho	Smart moves
Like you build up this elaborate argument	Ok
Counter arguments	Loll Yeah I have whole conversations in my head
Same but uh I usually just talk to myself	Lol that's what I mean Like I'll jist

Nah nah it’s my fault for texting so late lol Aw that’s so nice What are you planning on drawing on the card	I'm writing happy birthday in Chinese calligraphy But with a pencil It's not even calligraphy It's more like typefont
Damn calligraphy is hard fam Ohhhhh	I don't do stuff like this often tho
It’s still nice though I can’t draw pretty so I just write a nice letter and that’s it It’s like lined paper and a message	Tbh me neither I don't think I'll write a letter tho I see my mom evey day
Why do usually do for her birthday?	Not much really maybe we'll eat ot My parents aren't really into celebratig Their own

i just came back from chicago so uh not much	oh wow what were u doing there
college visits	oooh how was it
it was fine im just really tired overall	just fine? oh that would make sense make sure u get some res
it was cool Northwestern has some really cool opportunities and a nice view of the lake Uchicago has a really nice aesthetic and i like the campus a lot	ohhh yeah i think uchic's aesthetic is quite nice

Ohhhh I don’t have that kinda self restraint	Eh Comes with pracgice
Teach me your ways I get anxious if I’m not distracted	Eat while u work lmao That's a good fidget tool

in my defense physics is a very nice place to nap	Lol I think physics is p important to learn tho
regular physics	Still
Hey would you be down to read a crappy rushed essay on Kalamazoo	When's it due I definitely have time after Friday 4pm but before then idk
Like rn	Oh lol what I'll skim it Send it
Cool 	OK I like the language honestly But in terms of what the prompt is asking I think u need to be more Kalamazoo specofic U can integrate your addiction to people in a similar vein But like the thing about the tree or something Why not make it about something in Kalamazoo instead
True true	And ik your short sentences are there for the color but in some places there are many of them that makes it feel choppy and because of that it feels repetitive
Which places?	"""that frustrated me"" onward To the end of that paragraph So my personal take on essays is that they're meant to be artful But they're also meant to get a point across very clearly or at least make your reader think/want to know more Which I think yours does because it's interesting But think about ways you can incorporate more detail and u can remove some verbosity to add those details in I also think that you don't need to characterize addictions"
Got it	In the first paragraph It sounds nice but is too general for your purposes Other than that I think it's very good
The anxiety part or the reminder part	Just like the first two paragraphs Would be a bolder move to start off with I have an addiction to people (and it sounds weird but then u can explain or smth) Yeah try to frame it in the eyes of Kalamazoo like how is their Univ going to help u satiate that addiction
That’s what it was originally Ohhhh okay	Wait I don't want to influence u too much soin the end pick what u feel is best I got nothing else tho
Nah I changed it bc I was like “hm it could be more dramatic”	Hmm okay
But I could add more about kalamazoo instead	Yeah just do something that represents u best U got it
Thanks Why are you awake rn tho	Am actually laying in bed About to sleep
Oop Sorry	No worries His is when I'm on my phone the most anuways
That’s crazy I can’t imagine staying focused during work and stuff	Mostly I'm just running around all day but Tjwres too much to do To look at my phone lol
True college sounds very walking heavy	OK gn
Gn	U sleep soon ok
Sleep tight	Yeah it is
Uh Sure	Thanks ill try
Idk soon jamie kill me	Wait why
i finally finished my lofi playlist 780 songs its finally up to date	Omfg For what reason
I was planning on updating it but finally did it today	Omg Okay I'm proud of u
Thank	Omg go to sleep Please
Alr Bro I’ve just slept like 8 hours	That's Good right
That’s the most I’ve slept recently So it’s pretty good	Oh That's sad
Wait wait why is that sad I was so hyped now but now I’m not	But If you're not getting 8 on a regular basis Not good
I thought we talked about this last year lol It’s fine My back hurts now from sleeping so much but it’s gr8	Well yes But Still gonna say it
It’s fine I’ve been getting less than three hours for awhile and I’m doing fine	Nopenopenope Not good Even I wasn't that bad
I’m completely normal I’ll let you know once my body starts disintegrating or something	Ong No Not okay
I’m fine worst thing to happen to me is periodically passing out	That's not a good thing
It’s just me sleeping it’s not that bad	… I can't do anything
? Wdym	To help u The more I say It doesn't do anything
Okay okay How is it bad for me	Well Ok
What’s up	hi kevin ig i shouldn't ask why u aren't asleep how are college apps
Uh Okay I like writing so it’s fun I’m still trying to come up with stuff for my writing portfolio	oh goodie
Do you have any short story ideas	what theme
Anything it’s a portfolio	have u considered writing a horror or like a ghost story
Lmao that’s called an autobiography	omfg stop
But not really That’s interesting Yeah that could definitely work	i think that takes some good writing skill to portray horror in the right way
That’s true But coming up with horror concepts are easy Improv is my strength	i personally enjoy the ones where everything is normal until the very end when u find out that crucial fact that makes the whole thing wack
Okay okay what about this It’s a guide to exploring places But gradually the tips become more and more ominous	ah i see u ever watch night of the museum
Like it’ll start out with “When visiting local graves, make sure to get permission from the local keeper” and it’ll be forwards the end like “If you start to hear singing in an abandoned church, don’t. Look. Behind. You. No matter who they sound like, you must never under any circumstances. Turn around. Ye Ben stiller right	yeah just reminded me of that this sounds interesting
I feel like it’d be less of a short story and more of Story in the form of a list	huh interesting maybe u can write it as the guide was written by someone who had gone through a series of events maybe u can write it as a journal/diary instead
Thanks for the genre shifter though	ye np
I’ve been really focused on writing Phantom Tollbooth/little prince esque stories recently	no idea what that is but sounds fascinating
The Phantom Tollbooth? Really? The Little Prince???? They’re like super famous books but what they have in common is a introspective story, a unique setting, and a really cool vibe	wait ik the little prince that was like mind boggling for me to read even tho it was this puny ass book i felt like very spiritual after it i couldn't tell if i was trying to derive some like deeper meaning from a children's book tho weird af
If you like that kinda stuff I def recommend The Alchemist I love those kind of books so I tried experimenting with some ideas	oh huh ok i'll take a look over winter break
Yeah it’s more spiritual and kinda ethereal	yeah remind me to look at it if i forgot please also go to fuckig sleep
But like I’m not tired Plus my constant whirling thoughts and anxiety of being alone provide me with tons of adrenaline to keep me awake And also I had a lot of soda since we had a pizza party	.... go to sleep anyways watch a relaxing youtube video or smth
I mean I’m watching a twitch stream rn	smh i guess it can't be helped i'm going to bed now good night
It’s only 3 am tho??? Good night What’s up jamie	Hey I'm in Vegas rn so
Ohh	Limited texting ability
Gambling I see	That's right Lmao
That’s one way to pay off college Is it fun	Yes Lol
What have you done so far	Just roamed las Vegas strip Nothing else yet
Still cool tho Is it a family trip	Yes
That’s nice My family trips just usually devolve into chaos	Meh A bit of the same But Its a necessary evil
How so	Like If u want to vacation Inevitable chaos
Counterpoint you could always spend it alone Like me	I came all the way back from Boston to spend Christmas alone?
From the tone of you message I’m guessing no	Yessir
I guess that’s true	Omfg Why Ok Thanks kevin
Wait I’m sorry	I'm actually sleeping early tn Lol no it was kind of funny
Oh alright	Yessir N
I’m happy it was	Ight

Ayo Do you know if Bonvocation is mandatory Or at least important/relevant	Yes its mandatory but ts probably not important
Are y’all there yet? Do they check people in bc if not we might just study thru it	Yeah just study lol they don't check The president is just giving a speech Are u studying for the diagnostic?
Mostly for 18.06 but yeah I might take a look at the diagnostic too	Oh is that today
18.06 or math diagnostic? 18.06 is 9/3 but there’s a ton of required hw so it gonna take a while	18.06

Waitttttt Frickerino we played ourselves We walked to kresge looking for the post-convocation brunch and didn’t find it so tried to go to maseeh They told us everyone’s dorms were “doing orientation in the dining halls” but we didn’t want to walk back so we‘re in the stud Turns out that is the brunch xd	Lolll The brunchis in your halls dining place

Aite when may 21.5 or somn rolls around we finna throw a combined bday bash and get litty Provided finals don’t destroy everyone Also did you go to orientation stuff today?	LMAO aight That's finals week tho isn't it Yeah Academics this morning
Yeah probably fffffff May birthdays usually kinda unfortunate bc most big school events happen then Tfw prom was on/near my birthday for the past 4 years so no one was ever free Was it anything useful?	Um basically it was on class of 2023 academic requirements Like How scheduling requirements have changed Yeah well last year for me it was the day after we got out of school But my freshmen year I think it was like my final or smth Anyways Hit or miss Probably miss from now ob
Uh oh that sounds important Guess I’ll die Wait that is actually so unfortunate Oh well I mean was it fun to start off your summer with a celebration though	Yeah I still had tennis practice though Season wasn't over yet My friends threw a surprise party after at my house tho Yeah I can explain it to u later if u want
Okok thanks that would be much appreciated Dang that's so wholesome Surprise parties in general are so wholesome Nothing like a little shock and disbelief to make happiness feel happier woohoo	Yeah I was really surprised because my mom and family in general doesn't really let people over or do surprise parties They're always embarrassed because the house is so messy She told me a co-worker was coming over from China and made me clean my bathroom Before that So
LOL holy what a mood	Facts
If there is a guest coming within 100 square feet of the house then everything must be cleaned	No joke I cleaned my house for my own damn surprise
Also just like My friends are notoriously bad at planning things so i was astonished when they managed to pull off a surprise party in a different city Wait that’s so unfortunate LMAO did your parents just tell you to clean the house for unspecified reasons	My mom told me coworkers from China were staying at our house for a few days and I was like aight
LOL amazing Just no questions asked That’s a big mood tbh i feel like most asian parents alternate between banning guests for the smallest reason or inviting random old friends from 2 continents away to drop by and stay for a while, no in between	LOL YEAH My mom does that tho like sometimes people will come over like half a day notice But she always cleans ahead of time
Yeahh big mood On my last day in San Diego I told my mom that in the evening I was having friends over to bake some food And in the time I went out to pick them up, buy some supplies, and come back She has cleaned out the entire mf house	LOL OK I knew where this story was going g
LOL yeah	Did your mom think I was weird when I met her lmao
Bruh I walked in and the kitchen counter was spotless and I did a fat double take Oh nah def not She thought you were cool	Ayeeeeee I like being cool Also my counter is NEVER spotless
Yeah she just thought you were the spiritual embodiment of the  emoji Yo big mood it always has like sheafs of papers and wires on it And suddenly I leave the house and come back barely half an hour later and it is COMPLETELY bare I‘m fairly sure some law of physics is supposed to prevent that much matter from disappearing so quickly but asian parents just b like that	Ik the displacement is just Amazing Are u taking chem tmrw
Nahhh I am not that strong on chem Are u?	No lmao I'm ass Tmrw is relatively free then
Yeee Tbh I have had basically nothing to do for all of orientation so far So it’s always free Did you get a 5 on the ap chem test lmao	Well ok your reason for being free Is a little different Yeah I did
Ok yeah you’re already ahead of me I got a 4  good class but I absolutely did not know anything when the test rolled around	Lol I took it when I was a freshmand and had only one AP class though So I like put all my time into that class Does next have karaoke tonight
Still taking chem as your first ap class is impressive in and of itself Yes ma’am it do Are you gonna come? Also do you know if there are fun REX events are happening rn I’ve been playing piano in next for like 1.5 hour	Eh chem is the best taught class at our school Everybody takes that first Yeah maybe U can check outlit but idk if it works very well I couldn't find anything Also I don't think they schedule Rex events during these events How big is the practice room in next Do the laundry machines work in next
The practice room is mf uhhh The entire lounge Basically It’s just a piano in the middle of the lounge LOL I’m p sure the laundry machines work Not sure about the dryers We must believe in Christien It actually works pretty well	Oh right yeah lol Smh I need to wash my clothes I Dow loaded it alresdy But Im still confused about certain things About it
Oh yeah same I heard like There’s a glitch or something rn So everything is free Either that or they just made it free for orientation Do the machines in maseeh work?	Yeah but the dryers don't work
Yeah I think none of the buildings have working dryers f Or at least one full functional set of machines Highkey might just hang dry everything Also if you can’t figure out laundry you should come hang out in next Dave and Anton and I out here chillin	Yeah I was gonna do laundry after this presentation But I don't think I'll be able to So I probably will come and chill with some of my stuff
Okok bet just lmk when Also uhhh what’s the presentation about lmoa	Sure I'll tell u when I get to next I'll be there in like half an hour maybe They're painting at McCormick tmrw Siyoung asked if u wanted to come
Oh shoot What time is it?	9-11am but I think I'm going at 10 w siyoung
Oh okay bet I’ll go at 10 then Do I have to be swiped in even if it’s for REX? I’m not too sure how it works bc they have the whole single-gender thing	i don't know so maybe we should wait for siyoung she's notorious for waking up like late though
LOL a mood Yeah I’ll probably wake up around normal time like sometime 7am-9am So just text me when u know Or I might just text you to ask	how is that a normal time wtf okay yeah most likely i'll text u
Wait what do you consider a normal time LOL	like even if i had a good sleeping schedule the earliest i would wake up would be like 10-11am
Oh hmm That’s fair But also my internal clock has taken to waking me up at 7am (probably because FLP) And I usually wake up and check my phone and the blue light makes it kinda hard to fall asleep again	That's a very strict internal clock
What can I say I may not be good at much but I sure am good at shooting myself in the foot and always being sleep deprived B)	Oh man You're just like my parents Like I don't know if I'm tired I just sleep longer and it's so hard to wake up Also why are u still awake smh I'm sleeping rn btw But See u tmrw
Oh shoot sorry I passed out But also why u were up so late too smh Also look at the time  internal clock strikes again	I was taking a look at some scheduling stuff How did u do that
It just b like that Somehow woke up right before David’s alarm Also damn weather looking kinda good today We’ll probably just go across the river to eat then, shouldn’t take until 3pm I think Whats the status on Bainting	Well I assume siyoung won't be waking up until after 10am but since u and I are both up we could potentially see if they'd just let us go in now
Aite bet Gimme 15 min I’ll be at McCormick at like 935	Okay I'll change now and skedaddle over
Where u at	Be there in 2 Elevator is making pit stops
Kk bet Hello  I have your jacket	Lol OK thank u
Where’d you go I saw all 3 of your roommates walking together lmaoo	Yeah I just got back to maseeh lol I kind of walked a little faster then we lost each other I saw them just before I left tho but they were going somewhere I had already been
Oof It be like that This lottery process is so unfortunate	What's going on Or Hows it going More like
We’re just waiting in our dorm right now but like There’s only 17 doubles available lmoa Might end up having to triple or get split up and room with a rando	Oh shit that's ass When r u up
the lottery starts 7pm but the highest number between us two is 65 out of like 130 :/	Yeah That Is unfortunate U could be quad ing it up Or triple ig
Yeahhh f Also trying to figure out classes is big headache I thought I had them set already but the doubt is coming	Wait lmao you must be doing the same thing as me then
Wait I thought your schedule was fairly set already Rhetoric 6.042 6.004 and one thing right?	Idk it was but no PE classes are fitting into my schedule rn I was also considering 6.009 instead of 6.02
Oh shoot I haven’t even considered PE yet but I think I have the same problem Also I heard that 009 is very very anal about 6.0001 prereq Dave and I just spent an hour talking to his sophomore friend about classes so that’s why I started doubting	Ohhhh Yeah sm Smh Dk what to do
What a mood I think I’m gonna Not do 18.03 And do 18.100 instead	What's 18.100
It b like It’s 18.100A so I think it’s called analysis? Idk tong said it’s a good class especially to explore math which I kinda wanted to do	oh hmm so you're thinking of doing course 18 ?
I’m mainly 6 but I came in considering double major in 18 But now I just wanna try stuff out because double major is fairly unrealistic B) Maybe a minor if I’m lucky	LOL the emoji damn how do ya'll just casually use emojis while texting too difficult yeah okay that makes sense tho
I usually just spam  because it’s such a good emoji It can be like Smug B) Or like Ironic B) Or like Hiding the tears behind these sick shades B) Or I just use Bif the emoji itself isn’t available Also are u finna double/thinking about it	most likely not my plan is to minor 15-2 unless i decide i like something else like a lot yeah but the emoji is just tedious to get to
Ohh yeah you have the business stuff I just use B and ) together and it autocorrects  Also one reason I like it so much because it’s so versatile but so convenient	nasty emojis are not okay only :)))
 :)))) Do you use that passive aggressively	only sometimes usually not
:)) I can get behind this But also does Facebook not give you auto emoji anyways To be fair :) is a very different vibe from :)) but  is universal	:)) just use two no it's not universal i've rarely seen anybody who uses B) universally
Oh hmm Maybe it’s just a thing at my high school idk Also what do you consider the :))))) length before it goes from positive to passive aggressive Because I feel like :)) has a very different tone from :)))))))))))	uhhhhhh i feel like using a :))))) is weird it's either :)) or :)))))))) both of which i consider to be very nice but the more the better _:) is not common i feel it could be passive aggressive in context
That is true )) wtf it keeps autocorrecting now oh nvm Also Speak of the devil people around me keep using it	LOL alpacalypse i like that name smh that's interesting but strang
Oh my god okay there’s so much story behind these names Okay maybe not that much but like We all have weird names in that chat His is alpacalypse because for a while he went mega sicko mode and got like Obsessed with alpacas /llamas And his social media profile pictures all became alpacas And he got a “no probllama” phone case	LOL what What's yours
I have 2 One is YEET! And the other is EAVER Also our housing situation is so unfortunate We’re literally like the last people picking	is beaver because well maybe not yeet makes sense lol quad it is have u not picked yet
It’s because mit lmaoo We’re planning on tripling with frank But yeah we haven’t picked it We’re actually last I think	flp frank? damn i mean u guys did sign up for lottery at like 1am so
Wait our lottery wasn’t even sign up tho It was just randomly assigned  Yeah flp frank	"lmao pseudorandom you're also one of the only people to respond directly to certain messages like the replied to ""   "" what i said so u haven't gotten your room yet? that's unfortunate let me know when u do get it and i'll try to make u feel better although i doubt it'll be feasible"
Oh wait do people not do this much It’s a bit unwieldy but so convenient We got our room! 401, at the very end of a hallway :’)	i don't really do that but it makes more logical sense isn't that nice and quiet is it a big room aren't end rooms big is it a double hi! -anjalie
Hi anjalie! It’s a triple with frank :’)))))) Which isn’t bad but also gonna be just a bit more tricky figuring out comfort zones and ground rules and stuff It’s a fairly big room but the sq ft/person isn’t much bigger than our current double Also it lowkey might be loud? Dave went and took a look outside of it and apparently it’s next to some noise thing Also it’s kind of an end room but the end is like split into 2 rooms Like that	oh smh but it could be worse lol is frank a quiet guy i'll take a look tmrw then ig lol u always call him dave makes me want to start calling him dave too eh it always be loud here
I feel like frank has the capacity to be loud but he likes his alone time This is true I’m not too worried about the noise honestly Just the dynamics of a triple with a (relative) stranger are very different than having a double with someone you know well Also u should highkey start calling him dave Actually not highkey bc that may not be optimal but i think it’s funny and a nice nickname for a nice guy and I feel like he’s okay with it	Yeah that makes sense Since u don't know Frank that well Lol you're so sweet Yeah r u a heavy sleeprr I sometimes start calling people nicknames ironically But then it sticks
I’m not exactly sure if I’m a heavy sleeper but I do fall asleep fairly easily I think Like I just woke up from passing out in the lounge for like 3 min Yes I love this I made lowkey nicknames for everyone in one of my close friend groups and they stuck and I don’t think they even noticed	Damn I only get nicknames I need to start giving people nicknames more Oh that's good I keep thinking before I fall asleep
Do u get called Jim or jimmy What are ur nicknames Oh yes ma’am this is a large mood That’s why I said “fairly easily” because if my mind starts going it takes me 1-3 hours to fall asleep Usually have to be pretty exhausted to quickly pass out We out here, overthinking gang	I get called James Hamie ^spanish jamie Jimmy Jummy Jammy Jams Jimothy Jimmyfood All the time man Same man I'm such a big over thinker Awful
Damn that is a heck ton of names I just get called like Some variation on kevin sun chen usually usually ksc or kfc more rarely kevo Also yes overthinking just BE liek THAt We out here hyperanalyzing and regretting conversations and social interactions going from a day ago to 3 years ago	I do that A lot Unfortunately Yeah I've been called all of those And is already a nickname And comes with no other nicknames So Why
Wait what is jamie a nickname for?? Also dang You seemed like Too well spoken and social to have any awkward overthinkable interactions	James LOL fuck no Wait I'm literally not well spoken Nor am I well read or well informed Which I want to be more Didn't I tell u guys that story about my speech classes as a kid Originates from like England or some shit ^im hopping on this For clarity I still remember embarrassing moments from kindergarten and 4th grade There's two there specifically
I feel like there’s a sort of confidence in your speech that comes through as eloquence This is my life motto Yeah I remember but it really seems like they worked? HECK yeah direct reply is the wave and this is a hill I will die on (with some caveats) Oh yes the childhood embarrassment thing is a mood There’s too much to unpack in those memories so I lowkey just suppressed them	This is a lie and u know it You are most definitely Well read and informed Don't u think I talk too fast tho Bad habits man Every time I remember something bad I'm just like Wow can't do that And I'll bury my head as if it will be also buried in my head Smh
They call me peasant brain for a reason Wait I think your talking speed is like Perfectly fine I feel u though I always feel like sometimes I talk way too fast and it makes it really hard to clearly communicate whatever is imprisoned in my brain Mood irl U know what they say Your personality is built out of all the little traumas you experience Jk no one says that and that’s a terrible approach towards life but that’s what it feel like sometimes ig	It's less of thing now But it definitely used to be more severe Especially when I gave speeches Ive also been told the way I give presentations is really casual because my voice just sounds like that Damn that's depressing I guess to an extent Maybe not like personality bt As people get older u carry more burdens And embarrassments count as burdens too
Oh yeah this is a big relate I feel like whenever I give presentation or something public speaking I can never go for the official/serious tone so I compensate by trying to be deadpan/funny instead but then it’s very very casual But I think your voice is a lot more like Idk how to explain it but I feel like it’s very relatable Depressing but fax Also what time is your advising meeting tmrw?	Lolokay thank u 2pm
Aite bet If u wanna see the new room drop by any time that is not 11am 2pm 3pm then	Lol okay sure What classes u end up doing
I am currently getting chucked Cucked I have to talk to someone from the math department and someone from the CS department	like
If I want to take my classes	at this current moment in time? like rn
Yeah I’m walking trying to find these buildings	what r u trying to take that they won't let u take
6.004 lul And 18.100a Did they approve 6.004 for you	uhhh yeah
Fuhhhhhh	my prof just read off everything and was like okay yep
I’m tilted	what was 18.100a again
Did you have 8.02 and 18.02 credit?	you're taking discrete though right
Uhhh real analysis	i have 18.02
Yeah	oh okay
Oh well that makes sense	lol good luck kevin
They kind flamed me for not having any GIRs	:oooo
Thank u jamie I am lost as heck	is your advisor like young and wants to follow rules or old and wants to follow rules
My advisor is Traveling	oh associate dean ftw?
And so it was the assistant dean Associate	assistant lmao
Yeah Fuck	oh man fat L you should just add drop classes when he gets back not sure if u can do that actually but worth a shot if it doesn't work out
Fuhhhh I hivhkey might Everything is going terribly and the year ain’t even started yet damn Oh my god The lady I need to talk to is in a meeting until 430 Registration ends at 5 What in the name of all things good and holy did I do to deserve this series of events	so what did the associate dean approve so far
Uhhhhh	or did he approve a set of 4 you're not happy with because you should get him to approve something at least
Don’t think she approved anything	oh her mb
Just gave me a post-it and told me to find people	well shit it's already 3:22
I am walking fast but my demons are walking faster	lol that's a fitting metaphor uhhhh if both of the people u need to talk to people aren't free until late you should go back and have her just approve something and then change later if it works out what about 6.02 or 6.009 for now
6.009 is even more anal about prereqs than 004 I think Maybe 6.02 though What did you end up doing Are you doing 009?	there aren't any prereqs for .009 except .0001 yeah i'm doing 009 not 02
What the heck They kept telling me that I can’t do 009 because I don’t have 0001 Wait so you’re doing both 009 and 004 at the same time?	Yeah But aren't u ase 0001 So just assume u pass?
I can’t xd It’s conflict exam with 1806	Linear?
Yeah	Smh why are u taking 1806 Uhhhhhh So that is troublesome
Ikr that’s messed up all my plans tbh	Why can't u just tell them you're taking the ase and just Don't
Wait That’s big Brian Brain I think they’re more concerned with the fact that I don’t have any GIRs though Particularly 18.02	Oh hmm I guess u could just sign up for 18.02 now for the time being?
darn yeah might just end up doing that	Feelsbadman
Ok I got 6004 approved This is quite an adventure	NICE that's the first important move
Yeahhh I’m so glad the lady was nice The person I was supposed to talk to was out so I talked to another person and she was super super nice and I am eternally grateful Now i must wait until 430 to talk to math lady	Oh man You're cutting it pretty close Dedication though
Yeah f It just B like that Are u going to orientation stuff today?	Did the associate Dean say she was gonna be free after 430 What else is there today Other than the floor meeig Meeting
Yeah this has been verified twice but I have very little trust in bureaucracy at this point Uhh no clue but I see tents on kresge and music and people So I thought there was an event	Its just people having random fun I think Also hats what I'm sayig Can u do 18.02 and switch t to 18.100a later if it's on the way or smth?
Hmm I’m not too sure how switching and stuff works But if that does happen I’m just gonna skip 1802 lecture and go to 18100a lecture until they let me in which would be a headache I think I’ll just wait until 445 tops and then rush back to advising office if math lady doesn’t show up Also what do this be I have not heard about any floor meetings thus far	Most halls have floor meetings today To get acquainted ig Bold move You live life on the edge
It just how it be on this boinker of a world Sometimes you have to die in order to live Also I got 18100 woohoooo Am extremely lost now though The building numbers just b like that	Like Physically Oh Lol
Yeah LOL	RUN LOL WHAT What d u just have hat on hand

Where yat	Second floor Is where cafe spice is I'm sitting across from it by the wibdows
That is where I am yes O	Facing the lawn
What the	You know The little table area
How’s Harvard	they came closer to us tonight actually we went to a small thai place and then some of them came over to see maseeh
Oh cool Did you know them from before uni	yeah they're all from my summer program simons srp
oh damn the big brain club dang that many of them got into harvard to constitute a meetup	haha simons just be like that anjalie and i are the only mit simons kids tho but yeah there's many of them at harvard and yale there's more at yale but harvard nb i think near 10
what the heckie	yeah ik wild
our school didn’t even have 10 total harvard admits in the past decade that’s insane 10 from this year alone?	well they're all from different schools
yeah but that’s so like Congregated tm	yeah it's just that a lot of these summer programs are stacked i'm very overwhelmed by the brains as well
aint that a mood im surprised simons isnt more well known then usually people just go on and on about rsi or ssp but no one i knew had heard of simons before i came here oh wait OH ITS THE STONY BROOK ONE?	lol yeah not garcia though that's materials science rsi is popular yeah but a lot of people clout simons as being #2 although i'm not really sure
frick okay i knew there was a super op program at stony brook i just didnt make the connection	lol i wouldn't call it op and u may be thinking of garcia as well
hmm idk but with that track record simons is definitely many leagues higher than most programs	ha maybe then idrk do u know adi sidapara
nop who they be	oh hold up he's supposed to be legendary in arizona and part of socal 
o maybe im just out of the loop bu ti have never heard of him definitely seems like legend material though extremely Stanford tm	yeah he's very vc entrepreneur kind of guy but anyways he was apparently at simons the year before mine
dang thats the Ideal he’s living the dream and ofc exhibit 1 for simons op	he's a bit pretentious tho what can u do tho the man wants to make his connections
LOL fits into the stanford entrepreneur archetype perfectly this man is the marble carved platonic ideal of silicon valley silicon valley vc mold	lol yes indeed anyways yeah it's nice to know they're so close and that i'll probably see them often i have a lot of good friends at yale too though so it's a bit harder to see them alas
Yeahh It’s nice to have a support system in the area Outside of school Plus it’s always fun to feel like you’re meeting old friends from afar even tho it’s realistically like 20 min apart	lol ikr i haven't seen those guys in a year too
Yeah that’s a mood I have a close friend at northeastern that I thought I would never see again Bc he has to skip a bunch of breaks to do coop and summer classes and I thought he would graduate and move before we could meet up again But now we are both in Boston and gonna meet for first time in like 2ish years soon and it is very exciting	Oh shoot wow Okay that's really cool yeah yayy
Yaaaa he’s a super cool guy Really passionate about helping people (he’s a nursing major) Also passionate about watches lmaoo	Oh shit Oh man this is the watch dude?
Yeaaaaa he’s mega into horological stuff It’s really inspiring actually Hard to find people who are so passionate about something that they spend all their time learning about it and just loving it with their whole being Huge role model tbh	Damn I wish I could be like that  trying to go after tennis tryouts do u want to try to register too
Yea sure Is it open to mit students?	Ye
O shoot aite This is us right? Ah shit they have essay prompts too	Yeah It's just 200 characters I mostly just cheesed it Lol you're the first person I've met that uses words like cheesed and bonkers
Those are extremely good words to have in ones vocabulary Also yeah mood I was gonna try and fill it out on my phone but the ui is too wonky to type 400 words on mobile f Now that you mention it I only know 1 other person that says (said?) bonkers A lot more people use cheesed tho I feel Was that already in your vocabulary or has it just recently been assimilated lmfao	"Assimilated I liked it 400 words?? Yeah u say ""absolutely bonkers"" quite often"
Aren’t there 2 prompts of 200 words each? Or maybe I’m boosted and can’t read Huh I never realized! That sounds absolutely bonkers tbh Do people u know say like Yoinked or boinked or doinked or some variation on those	No I did not know Lol didn't it say characters Oops mb Still said I was registered tho
Yeah should be fine It says they prioritize student applications anyways Also are u going to Rune Whenever that is going to be	When is that Oh Yeah probably
Kk cool Also D a n c e a u d i t i o n s ?	Most likely not Maybe Most likely not though
Darn It be like that I might go for a rejection from DT or ridonk Heard auditions for a capella/dance were all around pretty brutal this year What u up to today	Lol what Not a rejection Oh really? Have no clue Also Just studying
Yeah one of my friends who did choir for years got rejected from every a capella group Also I heard from some upperclassmen that dance teams are really oversubscribed rn so prob instant rejection for ppl without experience Also darn The grind continues	Oh wow really?
Panic mode tm	Yeah they're good
Yeah i was pretty shocked	Well don't make me anxious
Oh nah I’m pretty sure you’re more than ready I meant I am in panic mode You’ve gone through all the psets and practice finals right?	Yeah but Googled syntax Mehhh Dw if u can do the homework Then I think you're ok
It’s okay they allow help() so you can probably puzzle most stuff out Darn the key word being if I can do the homework Gonna try to speedrun half the textbook in a day woohoo fml	Hey man it's OK u and David can hermit it out for a day And then you're free Don't tell David I called him a hermit lol
Lmao I’m sure he doesn’t mind He’s prob free for the day Knows chem well enough to breeze through orgo	that's true but he doesn't like it when i say he stays in his room all day
What the heck I’m pretty sure I’m in the room more often than he is Like 70% of the time I’ve been in the room thus far he’s been out and about	lol i'm wrong then
Very popular man	sure sure did your string lights come yet
nahh not yet but soon tm i think they arrive tmrw night or at least sometime before 9pm im excited finally gonna have some brightness in my mf corner did y’all order yours already?	Okay cool loll No we didn't Still waiting on u
Oh okay 6.0001 is 11-1 tmrw right?	yeah wbu
same time LOL they’re conflict exams or else i would’ve tried for 6.0001 wanna help me hang up them lights after the test  if they come in time	yeah sure lol oh ok i see
Hey How’d it go	Well It wasn't good But my test cases works so I think ill probably get partial find r all the ftq I totally went like panic mode though I hate it when I do that
O no It’s okay As long as the test cases pull thru Believe ^ Is this an accurate depiction of during 0001	Not quite More like this
Darn It be like that	Yes It do be like that
What r u up to the rest of the day	Nothing maybe tennis
Wow what a coincidence I’m doing the same thing Minus the tennis Not sure if this is what y’all were looking at but I would recommend getting one with an on/off switch	Loll There's no on off? It looks cool tho       
Yeah it’s just plug n play That’s a lot of looks Wait those count as emojis You’re using emojis B)	Was trying to switch to dark mode
Ain’t that in settings	Yes but somebody told me I needed to send a moon emoji first
Oh I thought they removed that feature a while back	Had no clue Convince David to come to maseeh
Come to next He says	No David's coming already
Idk he seems pretty stationary to me Nvm he’s prob headed over soon	So u should come too
I’m Gathering potential energy	OK reasonable
Ok I gathered enough energy to jump the band gap Can u swipe in	You're here already?
Yes ma’am There are no in between energy states for electrons	Lol OK I'm coming
Are y’all still hangin out	No I had a floor meeting so I went back
Oh rip	Ikr How was northeastern /dinner
Bruh it was so much fun We were just being absolute degens Made an inhuman amount of dumplings and a bunch of sauce and a huge mess And then we just sampled a bunch of different types of teas and talked I met a few of my friend’s friends and they were hella funny Just a lot of dumb wholesome memeing and fun Self-described small brain stuff And they gave me one of their old winter jackets bc they heard I didn’t have one yet It’s hecka nice What were y’all up to	Wait where'd u go That's the best Omg so wholesome We just played tennis and ate good maseeh food
In their dorm LOL One of them is graduated and does restaurant stuff now Yeahhh they’re all church buds with each other but they’re not super hardcore so it was very wholesome and cool Hmmm is that an oxymoron I detect B) “Good maseeh food” How’d they like it	Omg I almost said that's delicious Yayyy Absolutely not
It was delicious :’) The guy worked at a place rated best udon in the world And now he’s at a really high rated coffee shop I think What was the verdict from non maseeh residents Also I’m very glad you are all aboard the direct reply train	I like the smell of coffee shops David ate four plates So I think it was good I really like this because it creates clarity now
Bet let’s go sometime He told me to hit him up if I’m ever going to either of those places bc he can give us fat discount Very good You’ve been Converted™	PHAT PHACTS
Wait do you know if we have to show up for 042/004 recitations tomorrow Because lectures haven't happened yet but those recitations are the first thing on my schedule for Wednesday	Not sure I might go Depending on my lecture time And someone asked on piazza
Wait asked what on piazza Also are 18.062 lectures the same as 042 Or are they held separately	If there was 004 recitation Ges Exact same
Oh okay big brain Apparently 0001 is out	I PASSED Yeah Ive been refreshing my email
AYEEE	So I knew
Very very nice	How about 06 Yeah bless
I haven’t gotten any emails so either it’s still in the works or I NRed Both equally likely Dang look at u with clean 100% pass rate	It was bio and cs So I really
Not even worried	Dunno
S o c l e a n Are u excited for classes to start woohoo	Noooooo I have a 930 tmrw
What the heckie That’s illegal Rhetoric?	there's no recitation tmrw for 004 yeah it is rhetoric i'm going to be fantastic
First class on first day is arguing with people	what do u have tmrw ooooh that could be
I think your semester is starting off very strong	interestnig LOL
In classic jamie fashion  I have like 2 recitations in the morning but those don’t exist yet	are you going to go
It’s 042 and 004 so I already know one isn’t gonna happen	oh idk about 042 tho
Might check 042 but I don’t think that’s happening either But my first real thing is Advising seminar at 2pm LOL wtf	are you going to ask on piazza oh shit
I’m starting the semester off weak af	nahhh it's so nice actually
I wanna yell at what the hecc *yell at people	lol no advising seminars are smaller groups right i don't even like lecture hall
Yeah they are Oh I thought HASS were usually in smaller classes as well Like classrooms instead of lecture halls Since they usually have discussions right	oh it could be i'm not sure rhetoric was supposed to be a really popular choice u should let me know how poetry goes
Yaaa for sure It’s my first real lecture So basically I’m chillin til 7pm	oh cool that's the seminar right evening class should be good vibes
Yeahh evenings should be chill and very beatnik vibes It’s my HASS, my seminar is knot theory which I have no idea what to expect :/	oh wow your hass is so late idk what i expected though
yeahhhh gonna be interesting prob will miss out on a lot of pset parties and club meetings :/ but im apprehensively excited to see how itll be Oh wait what’s 15.0621	meh i seriously doubt it pset parties aren't until post 11pm imo that's data mining it's just some rando class i wnat to try but it doesn't start until october so that's lit
Oh dang that sounds cool Is it a discovery subject?	no it's just a rando 15-2 elective i'm going to fail it or drop it before i fail it
Darn that’s a mood Except with my actual classes No this is objectively false	oh right no record i meant metaphorically yeah so it's objectively false for u as well
I also meant it is objectively false metaphorically You will take the elective and explore the wonders of machine learning’s applicability	lol yes sure
And furtheryour love for cs and econ	oh man we'll see about econ
Howd u find 15.0621 anyway Were u just scrollin thru the catalog and chillin	basically
that's pretty big brain	lmfao nah i'm trolling my life
It’s okay You’re like Very well put together all in all At least compared to the shit I’ve been doing Wanna see something cursed	This is false And this is also false And kind of yeah But also I'm worried
Ok this is objectively true i am Mess™	U should sleep earlier today btw Omfg
I would but I’ve spent the past 30 min doing this dumb shit	OK it's kind of stylish though OK Now sleep Then LOL Yes I understood the reference
Ok this is the actual productive party I kinda messed up and didn’t plan ahead with that empty rectangle but I’m prob gonna put pictures there to fill it up Yes my job is finally done You should also sleep Rest is important esp with your first 930am	Good idea Lol OK I will My whole quad is knocked out About to be me U as well So Therefore Goodnight sir
Oh no this hit too hard Goodnight ma’am Have fun at your first class woohoo	Omg u got up so early again
Come to think of it this is our first intro to real mit	Thanks woohoo to u too
Wait it’s 9am not that early LOL	I guess so Stfu 9am is early
Smhhh Can’t miss out on those sunshine hours Anyways lmk how rhetoric go	I guess so Yessor
How did everything gooo	It was all just intro to class stuff Nothing super awesome Have y gone to any yet
Yeah i just finished my seminar Everyone here is so big brain They’re all math majors f Also lowkey fell asleep for like 20 min so I feel bad	Lol it's okay man nbd Just have fun while learbig
Yea that is the goal It b like that Was rhetoric a big class	18 people It do be like that B it that's ok
Oh dang That’s a pretty good size	It's more like a class than anything I don't really know if I like lecture hall
Oh rip Lecture hall is very Impersonal But it’s easier to hide absence be it physical or mental Class kinda forces you into constant full engagement But that’s probably a good thing	Yeah I see u I cant remember is attendance mandatory for lecture
I mean if the class size is big enough They really can’t check Unless they go sicko mode with iclickers	Isn't there like some sort of check in though
Those are the clickers Usually	Oh right smh Do they give us free clickers here
I really hope so Those things are lowkey pricey	Good cuz I haven't taken chem yet and I know they use clickers
Lmao same Hope that tuition $$$ goes to good use Making students buy clickers is biggest scam	Wait that's a cool thing Sticker
THe sticker? O Yes melty boye	Yeah Lol
Do you follow figure skating at all	no i do not but tell me anyways
O I don’t follow it too closely either but it’s nothing super exciting But Vincent Zhou and Karen are coming to Boston on 9/21 USA Olympic team and basically among skating’s biggest celebs rn And MIT is selling tickets At phat discount	oh what oh what that's cool i have no idea who they are what's the phat discount tho
Yeah it doesn’t make that much sense if you don’t know who they are LOL It’s like $10 a ticket To see Vincent Zhou and Karen which just blows my mind Also Karen is studying at Cornell rn so she is legend skater and big brain She’s actually class of 2023 as well	isnt nathan chen also 2023
he's 2022 i think highkey i almost chose yale just to meet nathan chen	wait but nathan chen is just at yale just cuz right omg i heard he's a douchebag tho
he's premed so i think he might have to grind LOL oh shoot relaly	but idrk
tbh not super surprised	he used to date chloe kim is what i heard too
his azn fuckboi game is strong af oh that was probably a thing yeah	most likely
celeb drama lmfao but yeah karen chen and nathan chen are like good buds shared the stage a lot i was actually lowkey surprised that karen chen would be at a benefit show but nathan wouldnt attend but it kinda makes sense ever since yale started it seems like he has other committments and lifestyles now	"Lol ""other commitments"" Who knows man"
Yea b like that Have you heard about the EC party on friday lmao	lmao what no
huge meme check ur email	lmao wtf i just checked it funny af
yea lmaoo i was so confused when i first saw it	damn me too how did u even get that email
low key thought “techfuck” was gonna be some club or startup	oh man
idk LOL i think it’s in some sort of dormspam	oh wow i wish our dorm spam was that interesting
but at this point i get so many rando emails I gave up on tryna figure it out next dormspam is like insane in both volume and content but that’s another story are u finna attend techfuck™ or at least thinking of it i think chanseo might pull up Holy next is getting evacuated	When is it The patty Also Wtf Why
Party is fri at 10pm So basically party to end first week I think it was like someone was boiling water and it got messed up or something LOL So the alarms went off for smoke or smth Idk who was cooking at mf 330am though	Aw shit So everybody had to leave the building? Sucks ass man Lol I have tennis tryouts on Saturday though Although I am trying to cancel on Merrick rn
Yeahhh it was a whole ass evacuation We had to all crowd into New lobby for like 40 min Good and memorable way to end first day of classes though LOL f it be like that Aite just lmk if u do end up deciding to go to the party Are u prob not doing club tennis then?	I guess it is an interesting story Yeah he wasn't happy Im probably still going to tryouts
Oh okay makes sense What time are tryouts?	10am This was probably my fault though cuz I woke up and didn't feel well so it was basically a last minute cancel which feelsbadman
Oh that’s early yikes Oh no How are you doing Why not feel well	10am isn't so bad Just haven't been sleeping well Not as bad as u though U should get more sleep
Yeah I been trying but I guess I’m just used to it now Very ironic coming from me but yeah sleep is very important!! Esp bc you have 9ams Is it sleeping trouble bc roommates Or the overthinking induced insomnia Or just other things Also if you start feeling worse I have a bunch of motrin so lmk if u need that	yes sleep is important no i just have a wack sleeep schedule my mind becomes best at doing work at 2am vibes not too bad since i usually sleep the latest anyways it might be troublesome for them if i'm really tired the overthinking is ok as in not bad meh i should be ok
Oh no this is too wholly relatable Once The Zone™ hits it’s all over Yeah using exhaustion to overcome overthinking does work but it also a very vicious cycle Kinda turned my senior year into hell Wait I have a meme	oh no i dunno about that but thanks
justifying overthinking is never the wave but my friend sent me this a few days ago and i thought it was appropriate	i cringe a lot
what a mood	i should stop using 2am vibes to jump start work though i didn't even sleep that late last night but it's been kind of consistently not awesome sleep
Yeah I get it It just happens f I used to sleep like dead log and then suddenly I started being unable to pass out for more than 4 hours so I’d wake up like 3 times every night and be exhausted in the morn Not sleeping well slaps like an angry asian mother This may not work all the time but one possibility is working with/near a group so everyone can hold each other accountable Channel societal pressure and mob mentality into productivity tm And that way you can get stuff done in the daytime	That actually sounds like insomnia I suck at studying in groups all I do is talk But sometimes if I'm with full on study mode people it does work I've stopped taking daytime naps which helps
LOL same holy shit Throwback to writing compliments at FLP and y’all powered through like 30 while I finished 1.5 Yeah idk I’ve just given up on trying to understand my brain and body bc there’s too much mess to sort through Yeah wait this is actually effective Naps are so tempting becaus they are comfy and nice and a good escape from all the chaos but they make normal sleeping kind of a hell Yea I think as long as you‘re in a group with a mutual understanding of productivity it works really well The problem is that most groups almost never reach that mutual understanding or they devolve into tomfoolery fairly quickly Especially rn because freshman fall pretending mode but that’s a whole different issue	lol ok i do remember that maybe u need yoga yessir
Highkey considered it for a while I also considered meditation but I felt like my brain was empty enough all the time that meditation would turn me into a full vegetable yes’m	NOOO HEADSPACE IS SO GOOD meditation could be helpful for finding peace seriously no joke
O hmm Do u mean headspace the concept Or like headspace the app Also dang do u meditate?	no the app headspace even though i only have the free version no not really lol i just like the idea of it and i'll try to sometimes ooh let me send u a youtube channel it's like traditional chinese cooking but so aesthetic 
What the heck that’s mega aesthetic It’s like visual ASMR dang	Ikrrr
Also holy 6M subscribers that’s insane Where’d y’all disappear to btw We turned around and y’all went poof	Wait bro I thought u were going w Alex somewjere We went down the closer stairs
Wait what no we were gonna head to stata with y’all to wait for 6042 Oh what we went down those too	Wait so where ru

Lmao mood It just blows my mind how clever and elegant they can be Like how do people make these connections dang My normie brain can’t handle	yeah it's cool aye here to learn amirite
heckyeahhh drink from the firehose and get teeth knocked out	Wait what Wait I didn't mean that But ok
It’s okay What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger Or better at proofs I guess lmao	Oh Yeah That too
B) You missed out on the chroma meeting f	Oh oops I think I decided not to do that
Darn It B like that Are u pretty decided on The Tech™ then	Eh I'm going to write a little for them
Mood Op ed?	yeah probably what's your kerb and what's david's
kschen wudavidh	why h
it’s his middle name	too many davids smh
no his favorite letter is h	lol ok
jk it’s just his middle name im still surprised jamiefu hasn’t been taken before you	why jamiefu isn't that common
i mean fu is a pretty common last name and jamie isn’t TOO uncommon	Wait since when Before college I was the only and the only I knew
What the heckie I knew a hailey fu and a jamie geng in hs And a bunch of other Fus Not as many Jamie’s tho	Oh wow Yeah nobody
It’s okay At least your name is unique then Get cool unsernanes *usernames	Lol ik it is cool
Yeah ur hecka lucky Even when I use my middle name it’s a 50/50 that it’s taken already	Oh what wow
Have you ever had to resort to anything beyond jamiefu	Uhhh not on anything significant no Jamie.fu Is nice too I prefer that sometimes
Dang That’s so Clean And nifty Deadass the other day I asked nextdesk for my packages and they were like “Sorry there are too many Chen’s which one are you”	aw man it is indeed clean i need your ID #s too
922831323 Not sure about David’s though Let me ask	btw i'm not adding u guys until like last second cuz there are 5 spots and i'm hoping to find out who else to put on there before the deadline
Aite bet Wait what There’s a deadline?	yeah for maseeh at least you can only change two more times after your initial submit
Oh shoot okay I think next is 3 only but you can change it anytime Are you on the next guest list already Actually are you even gonna walk all the way to next enough to need guest status	no and yes and david may add me well he said he would
alright	u can add me too if u want lmfao
that’s kinda redundant chief unless getting on multiple guests lists gives VIP guest perks or something I haven’t heard about	Lol ik I'm messing It is indeed redundant
you can add a bunch of people at once to guest list right	i have to add them at once yeah due on the 11th
idk when david is gonna do guest list stuff but i'm prob gonna add chanseo to my list soon so if u wanna get on next list soon tm im gonna do it in one go	oh yeah then just add me

Oh shoot we just ran back to new f We sprinted across a street and they decided they didn’t want to stop running I guess You should come hang out in new B) Also what the lab do Or what u trying to do with it	Lol I'm not tryna leave maseeh Image manipulation
Smh Your roommates are lowkey intimidating This is a universally agreed upon fact Oh yeah i remember seeing this I think I looked at it and decided not to take 009	Lmao fuck naw They're thots
LOL holy Savage Idk we were all like “Strange vibes emanating from that room” ™	Who is we We're mutually mean to each otber It's aight Actually jianna and Claire are nb
David chanseo and I Lmaoooo that subtle shade I wonder which roommate is being singled out	Hehe It's okay were all good Lol we're not scary people It's all good fun
Lmaooo rip Did you and anjalie have a disagreement or smth I thought out of the 4 of you you 2 were the closest	No There's actually nothing wrong lol
Oke I saw this coming out of 6042 and it spoke to my soul	Oh no

I submitted at like 11pm so idk if it’s late or not rip Its ok u got this Did any of your roommates get interviews	Yeah we all had interviews today

Oh dang big brain I think everyone put hack as first choice tbh	Yeah facts

O h n o irl Have you adopted the hermit life	Basically
Darn Is it coming along at least	Yeah Do u guys wanna come over and hang out for a lil bit
Does like 830 work	Yes We can play fish hopefully After I finish lab So bring ya work
Okay It might take a bit longer actually Bc we’re in the middle of pset grind rn So a few extra minutes may be needed	Lol that's okay
Ok we’re on the way Am here	OK I'm coming
Heyo do you have a team for hackmit already I ran into trinity today and she asked if we were still doing the smiley squad team	oh yeah she asked me today too at dining no i can't cuz i'm on hack committee now uh but i can hit u up with ben across the hall and maybe anjalie
oh shit congrats thats sick damn freshman year money moves which subcommittee?	not sure yet lmao lol idk man
oh well still hecka impressive	i'm going to die
oh no why die	because life is hard
that is facts but you know what they say under the candle is where its the darkest did anything happen in particular or is it just Hard Times™ in general	You've said this to me before and I don't get it Just I feel like class is hard already even though we just started And there's a list of things I wanted to do that I haven't done yet
it started as a meme between my friend and i but eventually it just became an unironic life philosophy open to interpretation but i guess in this case it means even when things seem hard remember that you're under the candlelight of so many great opportunities and successes this is a mood and i think its just gonna feel like this for the next 4 years they do say that mit is a firehose and its supposed to be fast, unforgiving, and usually brutal but in the end you do gain a lot	interesting interpretation
also the schoolyear just started u have lots of time! and think about all the things youve done already	yeah i guess so it's just not like public high school lmfao
most people i know myself included hav ebeen rejected from everything we've applied to on campus so far	hmm ok that's reassuring ig well i haven't applied to anything so far lol except techx
and here you are already on committee of mit's largest and most well known tech club	LOL omfg
yeah the transition is mf brutal because high expectations	it's all hit or miss man yeah i mean it's only been like that for me during the summer research shit
HIT OR MISS I GUESS THEY NEVER MISS HUH	which gave me a lot of stress omg i like that lyric though
burh same i unironically screamed it every day for the first half of senior year	oh oh no
i think with classes and wanting to do the many things possible here it's really easy too feel overwhelmed or like youre drowning if you look at the overarching big picture all the time because theres just so much to do to get from current moment to future aspirations and so many winding paths and possibilities in between idk if it works but its probably healthiest (mentally and for working towards achieving goals) to take it moment by moment and day by day	yeah i feel so sad not being able to try out everything though yeah that's true r u following your own philosophy or how is that going for u and yeah i just feel like even though i know there are many paths to success i want to find the right one and that's hard for me
yeah that’s facts, there’s so many amazing opportunities here and deciding not to do things is as hard as actually doing them it’s like watching a whole tree of future paths just fall away and you always wonder what would’ve happened if you took those paths instead life philosophies are a lot easier to think of than to follow unfortunately i am completely and utterly overwhelmed  but what’s new woohoo but the small moments of peace and contentment in between all the drowning are nice and makes things bearable yeah life’s just like that ambition just be like that doesn’t help that we live in such uncertain times and can’t just work minimum wage, buy 4 houses, and retire to go fishing every day like mf boomers i really don’t know how to deal with that problem either and it’s just one big existential challenge but i think no matter what happens or what paths you choose you’re gonna end up successful you’re jamie™ pride of michigan, top science student™	yeah that's how it be but ig there's really nothing you can do about it right you only get one life so u gotta pick and choose to make the best of it it'll be alright yeah it's easy to get caught up in whatever is happening around you but focus on yourself first! welp u use this tm thing quite a bit fml
yeaa gotta forge thru the existential anxiety weehaw yes ma'am and u as well! you always seem so busy pls try not to overwork yourself tm it's lowkey a bad habit but it adds so much flavor™ to words imo	Doing alright so far but we'll see how that lasts OK I have a 930 tmrw so I'm finna sleep Gn kvin
aite yeah u should definitely rest gn jmie Hello jamie sos Do you have part c of 1-3 done for 042	Yeah
jk nvm but do u have part d of 1-5 actually the answer seems deceptively simple so i want to make sure im not boolin	Uh yeah let me get it
Okok ty!!	Tell me what u guys think If I'm wrong tell me
Sorry I was walking give me a sec Okay i basically have the same thing except with for all n Since the point is to state that there are infinitely many twin primes right Wait what’s the left arrow Oh that’s /in nvm Also I thought for c) we weren’t allowed to use mod?	Wait where did it say That Aw shit How'd u do it then
I’m not sure if it’s right but	Oh that's a cool way of doing it
I’m not sure if it’s right though :’) Did you latex everything already?	Nope
oof its highkey tedious	ah shit i'm on number 4 rn but need to fix 5 i remembered
darn did u use a number line to explain 4 i feel like 5 shouldnt be that bad to latex is 4 tedious?	Yeah I'm on 4 now It's aight
alright thats good very not down to pull another late night for latex did you use truth tables to explain 1-3 a)	I did not
diggity darn	I just said by definition
yeah that seems to be the wave, just wasn’t sure because the explanation for xor seems very short otherwise	Yeah I submitted a half hour ago
 flex	Lollll I see u
	Exactly OK I'm going to bed Gn
  Heyoooo Are you at any parties rn	Nope

HAHAHA YEAH	 are u guys able to access this dataset like students
I’ll check I’m gonna ask someone else to open it for me cuz our Duo authentication is acting weird w Chrome and Safari is being weird too	Omg  thank for going through the trouble
LMAO it’s no problem at all Okay so even w using our student logins then I can’t load it on safari and eduardo can’t on Firefox Do u have another alt pton site? I can also ask our library	"aw rip hmm ok i'll keep looking that's strange no worries it's a ""non-commercial license"" but idt MIT has it anywhere that's easily accessible so i thought i'd give it a shot i think my research prof has it somewhere but he's been largely unhelpful so far i sent him an email tho so hopefully that'll bring some good things"
What’s the data set about? I’ll try to ask another friend to try It’s possible eduardo and is WiFi is shit and it is	NYT Annotated corpus - a set of news reports/articles collected over like 10-20 years from the new york times with tags on topic and other metadata
ok so my friend rohan figured out how to do it! i will now try it on my end and send u the data	:oooo [wowowow thanks youuu
OMG i dont know why its not working for me i have to access it through some weird af university remote access vpn but the vpn isnt cooperating w me LMAO since my friend was able to access it i think im just gonna ask him to download the data set and send it to me and then ill fwd to u	HAHA WHAT Ugh blessily
so my friend says he sees a ton of links and files	the dataset is very large
LMAO and thats the entire dataset right okok i dont think......he can email all of it LAO LMAO so how should we do it	ummmm so dropbox is an option or like he can just send me a sample to play with while i wait for my prof sosmething from 2007 maybe? i think that's the most recent year
oh my fuck im finally in ok im sending screenshot so all of these files are in .tgz idk wtf that is but can i just send it to u in dropbox in that format	omg bless i love u that's totally fine i can unzip those
can i do google drive or do u want/prefer dropbox	anything u want LOL uhhhh jamiefu@mit.edu has unlimited storage so if u want to google drive or dropbox that email that would be great
hi	Hi kylen What's good
I just pulled some stupid shit	Uhoh
lol How are you You graduated right	Yeah June 1 I'm doing ok Little stressed here and there But not bad Define stupid shit
What’s there to be stressed about	Forgot we had to submit some advising stuff and it was due real quick so
Ohhh I see	Yah
idk I’m feeling pretty sad none of my school friends are up and I just broke up with April	Oh no Like Just now?
about an hour ago	Oh mt Do u wanna talk about it
Do you wanna hear about it lol	Yeah tell me I don't know if I can make u feel better But I'll try?
aw ok thanks I just didn’t see myself with her in the future and I didn’t want to waste her time when she could find someone else who makes her happy but man she’s my best friend like almost all of my emotional support and she’s so caring and nice	Bro don't u make her feel happy tho
not long distance	What did she say
sadvibes really sad	:((
I dunno man I was numb before and now I’m just sad	U guys can always try long distance
it was 2.5 years	Right
no it’s not gonna work	I definitely know a few long distance relationships It's hard But Idrk either R u guys still like Friends at least
I don’t know, I want her to heal and have closure and I don’t know if that’s the best for us a clean cut heals better right we didn’t come to a conclusion on it anyways	Omg Idk but I just feel like It's okay to be a little selfish sometimes and if u guys are both happy w each other Then why run from it like Ik you're probably like oh It's not going to be OK in the future But nothing is ever like Impossible Idrk That's just how I feel But I also don't know what u guys think either Because if she doesn't really understand like What you're thinking of For the future anyways Itll be hard for her to Yanno Come to terms w it Gosh idk why I'm dealing out relationship advice I'm single as a pringle
loool	This is all from the reading I do And I don't think that's very representative So I guess U should talk to some of your mutual friends or people you're close with too
Yeah I have a little	They can tell u better about what they think will happen or what's best
I think it’s best for both of us But it feels like I just stabbed my sister in the back	Wait what does this have to do with your sister
ok sister is kinda weird	Or was that just a
Best friend LMAO	Oh
Fuck	Well yeah duh Because u don't really want to LOVE IS NOT LOGICAL There That's all I can give u OK weirdo Idk will it hurt more now or later Because like if u guys naturally grow apart bc of the distance would it be easier to break up then?
but I also don’t want to do that to her like that’s just dragging it out	Yeah I guess so But then again It could also just Not happen at all Where is she going to school
Rutgers	What the That's in new jersey Youre not even that far
It’s like 3 hour train	You'll have holidays and weekends right
yeah	I thought she was like different region of country But this is achievable imo I feel like you're kinda scared tho Like what if it doesn't work out and then We're both really hurt or it feels like I wasted my time Right
yeah	Yeah it's a choice you make tho ig Risky but Could be really nice if it works out
fuckckckckckckckckckkckckckckckckckck	Sit on it for a few days Which decision will u regret most But for now Sleep Talk to some friends tmrw

LOL what’s a control	Agree I should've gone slower in the beginning As to not set expectations

Ok do u have a time from for dinner Looking at 5:30 to 7:30 rn Obviously u dont have to be there that whole time	Most likely Our mass is greater than yours So u should eat somewhere closer to us
I cant believe u said that	I'm aN mIT sTUdeNT
Thats it Dont Lai You know ur roots	Lmaoooo Happy birthday sir
Thanks jamie !!	:DD lol i think i saw this on your story so cute Do u know anybody that lives in eliot
Not very well but yeah why	Oh I was just curious because one of my coworkers at lunch today was talking about how he is a resident tutor there
Gotchu yeah thats one of the shittier upperclassmen houses I stayed there for Visitas and it wasnt the best lol	Oh lmao that's no good then
Hows work	I know what people mean when they say same old same old now
Would this be classified as “Not lit”?	alas yes it's not bad but i don't see it as a long term career option
Being a straight up software engineer?	correct
Damn me too tbh Whats ur ideal type of work now?	yeah i'm a little stressed bc i didn't like it as much as i hoped it's not bad but it's not great i think it needs to be work where i get to talk to a lot of people and/or move around during the day i like meetings honestly
Ur like a Google person lool u could totally get in there	Lol is that what Google is like??? Damn I actually think it would be nice to work there for at least a while in my life Hopefully get into some sort of tech management work I mean I'll have to start practicing for the interview alas
I think? Have u heard the fantasies super modern workspaces and like fitness rooms and stuff But yeah ive been applying to tech internships for the past week If they accept my resume then yeah interviews are gonna be a toughy I have no idea what kind of brain teasers and coding questions they ask so Ill have to do some research and practice	yes it's pretty awesome microsoft is nice too but the building isn't all microsoft so there's not a whole ton of people in the part of the country ig lol and i'll never get to see satya nadella in person ooohooo damn i shouldn't give up and keep doing that i sent in a bunch of stuff in the fall but p much i've been rejected leetcode is p good
Yeah its hard to get stuff first year of college I just hope I get something but ill have to get more experience myself with software Ur in a much better position so i wouldnt worry	this is true well i'm hoping spring career fair goes well and i think i just motivation rn like sometimes i'm just like college is too hard for me adulting is too hard for me and then i just want to bum on my parents' couch
Lmao same So much work	agree T.T
But when i lose motivation i just think about how much more the stuff we do has purpose in college Compared to high school	huh that's actually really interesting way of thinking about it like i feel like i need to stop emphasizing like just school now cuz there's a lot to do
Like grades?	yeah i mean like grades and like some people here just want to take 7 classes a term but i'm like i'll take my 4-5 classes and find some other stuff to do
Yeah theres no need to do stuff like that and take super hard classes	but then i still get overly stressed about my classes even when i don't need to be sometimes
Its more about the other stuff u do that u remember in my life	like i always prioritize it when i shouldn't sometimes yeah
Like no ones gonna use discrete thermodynamics in context of eigenmolecular functions Even if u want a career in tech Ur probably not gonna use much of the stuff u learn in college I feel like its more important to get involved and make connections and find passion, especially at the schools we are in u know	niceeee yeah that's true my mentor at work told me on friday like college is for learning how to learn and i was like yeah that's like p true ig leon make sure you hire me one day i won't disappoint
Lmao u kidding me	no sir'

Ok Any time?	actually yeah i can go in a bit just let me change and grab a quick breakfast
Ok lemme get outta bed lol	damn me too
When you wanna go	How about 20 minutes meet on the tennis courts I haven't eaten yet You bring the tennis balls ?
ok me neither lol Twah Yeah* I got a few	Okay cool I'm grabbing my rackets now I'll be there in 5
Ok I’m outside the courts on the end nearest to Next	Boiii So far
Where are you	Walking towards Really close
Are you maseeh	Yes
Hmmm wit I don’t see you lol Can you hit tomorrow early afternoon	6.0001 ase
What about like 2 I have 18.03 until 12	How about today evening Im napping after 6.0001
Can you do like 5pm or so Lmk when you’re up	Yeah 5 works David and probably my roommate jianna joining too
Ok Which court	Middle
Of the left or right	Uhhh just the middle area and then we can decide
Ok I’m heading over	Me to Too
I’m here wya	Almost here Do u have class ynrw morning at all Tmrw
At 11 Why do you want to hit	Yes
9:30?	Yeah should work
Do you have a plan for breakfast Because I don’t	wake up eat at maseeh play tennis
Do you have extra swipes Can you swipe me into breakfast	i have a total plan not like weekly but like r u not on meal plan
I’m not on meal plan I usually get swiped in by a friend into next But that’s not really possible since we’re playing tennis	oh hmmm wait r u cook for yourself then but yeah if u want to come down here i don't mind
Sick thanks 8:45ish?	uhhh should work just text me just in case
Yeet Bring my tennis balls please You have them I believe	Yeah are u awake I just woke up and I'm absolutely dead I went to bed pretty late last night so I feel like Bleh Is it too late to rain check
Wat I’m like already up lol can we get breakfast at maseeh	Yeah sorry but yeah u can come over and I'll swipe u in Wait like do u just wanna eat cux ill just
Can you still play	Give u a swipe But I want to go back to bed
Dude	Oh Well Not really I haven't been getting enough sleep so I feel kind of dizzy But if u want to come over and eat that's cool
Welp	Sorry man Ik it's like
Yeah I kinda woke up like three hours early for this	Late notice U could go back to bed? If u can
That’s like very not possible lol I already got up and washed and everything	Aw shit Sorry man I just don't feel super hot rn
Ok yeah sorry about that but this is like kinda really annoying for me Like stuff happens but if you say you’re gonna play, can you please try to commit to it Also I’ll be hitting against the wall on the court nearest to next so can you bring my balls there	Yeah I know this is suboptimal I actually wanted to play again before tryouts too but I need to maintain my health esp now so I'm sorry again that you had to wake up early only not to be able to hit Are u hitting rn? Do u want me to bring them over rn
No I don’t mean today I meant the other times Yes	Wait what other times
Like, I should not be wondering if you’re gonna cancel after you said we will play right	I mean I don't think I've done that as far as I know because most times I'll try to say maybe if I don't know what I'm doing that night yet Since our schedules are so hectic rn I haven't really had time to schedule things definitively yet which i why I've been kind of playing tennis randomly and whenever people are just available at the moment
Alright fair enough Can you bring the balls	Yeah sorry again about today but I'm omw rn Two of the balls we took were from the court next door btw and they asked for them back but I still have 3
It was 3 year We going at 11?	Oh wait Im not going anymore I just realized I have to write a speech tmrw morning before elections for a club lmfao U should try to convince jupneet to go
Oh ok	R u going today
Nope	It's at 7 right
Yep	:ooo First time no @prwctice?
Also last Friday lol But yeah basically I have to tutor unfortunately	I wouldn't know lmao Bro you tutor???
Do you wanna hit during the week Yes	What subject
Math lol That’s the only thing I know	What kinda math Hey u know it p darn well tho
I wish	Work usually kills me during the week So unlikely
It depends, today is a group of kids for competition math Usually is a kid for a research-type problem but obviously on an easier scale So basically now I’m the “grad student” who knows how to solve the problem at a glance and have to help him learn for the next year	Ew competition math
Lmaooo it’s so easy to teach	Is said kid in high school?
I don’t like it tho ngl Yeah	Quit Lmao
What Why would I quit He’s paying me	Don't do things u don't like
Oh I don’t like training for it Teaching is zero effort	Lol fine do it for the money
I mean it doesn’t matter what I teach It’s all the same to me Matters what I’m learning	Wait so U have to learn for what u teach
"No I teach what I already know Ok so there’s like -things idk
-things I’m learning
-things I’ve learned but only kinda know
-things I’ve mastered
-things I know like the back of my hand I usually just teach the bottom two Also shouldn’t you be at practice"	Yeah I'm late I'm still in line for food I calculate I'll be close to an hour late
LOL Where	It's OK I'm p exhausted today
Student center?	Dining hall baby
Lmao Weak	Got them meal swipes because there's no time to get food
Maseeh is an L	Agreed Happen to live in maseeh
F	Where do u live
Sucks to suck Wut you don’t know Take a guess	Next perhaps Or macg New Something on that end
You might’ve guessed half of dorm row but ok Should I come to maseeh I have 40 minutes to waste	To maseeh d? Only if u want to eat
I’m not going in dining If you leave dining I’ll visit	If I leave dining it'll be to go to practice
Lmao	So was it new or nedt
Ok	Next
Look at your message	Oh Is it nice Were u on a meal olsn How does new even work Is it culty
Wat No and no	Do u know how to cook
A little Me & my roommate have cooked like 8 meals or something Granted a few were quick breakfasts But it’s enough to get us by And it’s way better than the dining hall and even the student center Except rn we’re a bit low on groceries lol	Who's the roomie
Michael	8 is not a lot
Diao	OK no clue
	Lmao
It is First off	It's less than not a lot
That’s most dinners last week And we usually don’t eat breakfast Because we wake up mega late That’s also most dinners this past week	What's lunch
Depends Usually either noodles	What type of food do u usually cook
Or student center because I’m in a rush Uh we have several things So we can make like Noodles with Bok choy Or tofu and cauliflower	That sounds good
Or cabbage Or eggs with tomatoes Or broccoli with tofu Or gnocci but we haven’t gotten around to thag yet Dude I make wicked cabbage You should try it Diao is half addicted now And he didn’t even know what it tasted like before	Bro if you're offering food I'm always down
🤔	Also this is my favorite dish in existence
Tennis + food Jk Lmao one of mine too Cabbage is my first Eggs tomatoes are my second	Interesting that cabbage is 1 tho I'm not a super huge fan of it
I love cabbage	But Open to new ideas
I’m closed to new ideas Jk But I love cabbage	Lmao OK I see u
I’m actually compact	I know Because you've said it Many times
Did I It sounds like a me thing to do What does compact mean then 	Wdym compact Oh Missed that text
Wat	Uh
Oh You meant my cabbage text	Idk eithwr Below your cabbage tect
sent an attachment.	Where u said I'm compact
You’re welcome Compactness is a very important notion It means that you can squish stuff Jk That’s not what it means Actually it kinda is	Is this nath Math Do I want to know this
Yes It’s crucial	OK explain
Oh it’s really easy If it’s like R^n R is the real numbers Subspace is compact iff it’s closed and bounded Which means Bounded means there’s a distance D where nothing in your space is further than D away From the origin Closed means that if you take any convergent sequence of points, it contains the limit points So think about like In R (0,1] So if you take points that get closer and closer to 1 That’s ok because you’ll get 1 But if you take points that get closer and closer to 0 You die because it doesn’t include 0 In general you can think about it somewhat like that That’s actually very wrong but it gives enough intuition	I am still confused
Don’t worry about it How was practice	I sucked ass
Rip	It's aight tho
Next time kick ass	Whose
Everyone except mine	OK easy peasy
Yeah no sweat Simply straightforward	great
are you making a bracket	i am but i kind of don't watch that much tennis these days so i know nothing also it's not letting me make one yet so i'm a bit confused
lmao i havent tried yet because im lazy wanna help me make one later	sure i'm down i'm p awful tho and to make it worse i have bad luck
me too dw ok im still in the infinite ill drop by maseeh like maybe in an hour or something or half an hour or 1.5 or something	the fuck u doing there
i need to make an account lmao theres the mystery hhunt	go for half an hour
"im ""helping"" lmao fine"	this sound ominous
yeah im secretly plotting their demise the demise of all the puzzles obviously	oh mystery hunt interesting i'm going to be taking a shower for the next 15 min do not rush
im not rushing dont worry tell me when you done	I'm done lol
Gonna arrive soonish I’ll be in the lobby in like 2 Pls rescue me from the front desk	Lol Ok Oh what the heck it's snowing p hard outside Hey don't wait up for me my dad is still talking to me If u need to leave feel free
Whoops lmao Math all day dood	Oh Nice
I didn’t do any math lately rip	Same rip
F rip Are you going to practice I actually do not have my racquet lol So it would be lit if I could borrow yours 	yeah most likely i'll be going
Yeet Should we make a wta bracket lol This one is really gonna rely on “whose name sounds cooler”	Sure lmao
Lol xd When should we do it Keeping in mind that matches start in two hours	Oh wait wtf Wait u just make one then
But that’s so hard Should we just skip it lol	meh yeah
Whatevs Hi Do you have an extra racquet Can you bring one	Yes it'll be the same one from last time I haven't even changed yet tho So I'll be a little late Might want to find someone else's first
Yeet Fuuuuuck Shapo lost	Nice
Our bracket is dead lmao	Whole brwcket Gone
Exactly Rip	Sadder for him tho I imagine
Lmao yes Also coric lost rip	Ayeeee
You missed a video chat with Merrick.	Whats up can't talk now
I’m very sorry I may have broken your racquet’s string	Omfg
But I will reimburse your string and stringing cost Just like Try not to use the $25 service at the bubble  * Sorry lol this is so disappointing	Lol can u just cut all the strings out Nbd
Wat	Just to make sure the tension doesn't fuck up the racket
What	Like
Do you usually cut the strings out	Yeah
Tf	Otherwise the racket can get malformed
You don’t just leave them in? Wait seriously There’s no tension though	Yeah
Why would it be malformed	The imbalance of tension
Weird	Since either the horizontals or verticals
How do I cut it	Well There should be smth in the tennis courts Or u can ask the dude at the desk
Should I bring it tomorrow then lol Have you not popped a string yet at mit	Yeah sure That'd be great Nope I think they should have wire cutters tho It makes sense for them to
I’ll check tomorrow If not what do I do Weak	oh did u leave already
I popped it at like 5 lol	uhhhh i don't know i'll have to find a way to cut them then oh what just bring it whenever u can then i'll find a way to cut them
Ok sounds good I was cooking before I just sat my ass down lol	oiiiii should throw in a little soy sauce
Duly noted	:)
Can I bring your racquet rn Well anyway I’m probs gonna pop over to maseeh so pls be there	Uhhh if u want I'm about to go take a shower and get ready for bed
Ok pls hold off on your shower for like 6 mins while I haul ass to maseeh	lmao omg u don't have to bring it today
I’m here In the lobby It’s frickin COLD called you. Are you eating at maseeh tonight Before practice	I'm probably not going to practice
Well you should eat at maseeh So I’m not a loner Pls come There’s literally 3 ppl Me Arun and senza Sneha	Lol I can't my friend from Princeton is in town
I’m mad I can’t believe nadal lost three tiebreaks 	I didn't watch this match but Just saw on fb
Neither did I, it started at 3:30am lol I dunno how Djokovic will fare against thiem, it’s much more difficult to say	Oh huh
Projected route is that Djokovic demolishes Federer in tonight’s semifinal, thiem probably beats zverev in tomorrow’s semifinal, and then Djokovic plays thiem in the finals I just don’t really know how Djokovic will do against thiem. Presumably he will win because he’s playing at an ungodly level but I think the matchup isn’t great for him	We shouldn't trust any more prokections
I mean these are pretty clear cut Not like when you put world number 384857 vs world number 384952 but the latter has 3 more hard court Elo points	Lol u never know
It did happen	nicee
Does maseeh have late night dining	I'm not sure Did spring mp start
I think so But idk McCormick started	There's only late night on nights when there's school the net day
Fricko That’s annoying	Meh
No practice today?	I'm home for the weekend
Oooh exciting Are we winning the bracket game	Am I supposed to be checking
Yes At least we got the winner right	Indeed loo
Hey we got second Fuckin Arun beat us	Oh Nice Lol He's too dedicated

What evidence do you have for that	the chicken thing on club tennis page
Ok so I once held a chicken And I have a dog	yes and
Anything else And	idk i just made a broad assumption
I mean It’s correct Animals are so cute Especially Oreo I love animals	yeah i figured u would say that
Don’t you agree though They’re so cute And pettable	most animals
Ok most I’m not gonna pet like Your mom, for example Jk A spider I probs wouldn’t pet a spider But chickens yay	wtf lmao ok
A bruh Bruh*	Youre a weirdo
Excuse me? You’re attacking me for liking my dog	No The chicken

What an outrage	Ehe
🤔 What should I make today I can make cabbage or noodles and bok choy or eggs and tomatoes	Eggs and tomats
Of course MDe it	Oh shit I'm so jealpus
Yeah who’s the weirdo now	what does this have to do with beign weird i am appreciating food
Weirdo You should appreciate my other dinners (Yeah it’s always a subset of the same six things)	lmao you're right it is
Just sayin, they’re all really good	that is true
Indubitably Man look at this CUTIE	is your dog here or do you just get daily pics

Rip Hit today?	Can't Very hosed
Are you always hosed	Not always
Lol k	text me/jack if you have any contested kills, but otherwise if you kill someone just have them pass on their target to you
Lol j	hey michael just wanted to let you know that 1on1s are canceled this friday and saturday :(( lmk if you need anything or you just wanna talk - hope everything goes well in the next few weeks for you and stay safe!
Lol h	i don't understand you michael but that's ok michael on a scale of 1 to 10 how easy are your starter tasks going to be for you because i didn't know you were getting assigned to it so i built the starter tasks for people who didn't know react
Yeah um I don’t know react : D	wait actually?
Well I know react	jianna just told me u know it very well
Well that’s very flattering  What makes her think that	i have no clue she just said u do know it anyways what i'm saying is if the starter tasks take u like a day please come back for more because there's plenty i could assign lmao
Aigh aigh bet	i am a sad non-js knowing non-react knowing child and therefore i don't fuck with any of dev's frontend work as of now lmfao
o rlly? :o Wait who else does spectacular	sadly yes i can read someone else 's code and understand it and i did an itty bitty tutorial over self isolation period but sadly that is it if i end up doing nothing over the summer
F	i should learn react lol eh i should learn it at some point
Wait just learn it thru Hack It’s not terrible	umm so jianna julia jack justin and i worked on it last semester
It’s like if HTML and Java had a baby	LOL interesting way of putting it i was going to try to do more react work for spectacle yeah
^ I like that idea	idk if i'll be maintainer for it anymore tho idk if justin and jack will continue to work on it jianna is p interested init and idk if julia will switch or not
Hmm maybe if u want to learn react you should look into some of the dev starter tasks for Spectacular They seem pretty React heavy ;)	LOL ok michael i see what u did there ok you know what by thursday evening my life will be statistically more in control that it is atm so at that point i will in fact take on something react for spectacle thank u for the motivation to uphold this
 Wait are dev tasks due tonight or next meeting?	14th
Whatever you do Don’t make the task too hard	yes sir what do u want to do for spectacle i can align it to what you're interested in
Oh idk	lol alright also when u get spectacle set up will u document all the things u need to setup we're trying to make our documentation better + troubleshooting things
Is that a task? :o	lol consider it one what device r u working on
Surface pro	LMAO nice are u gonna do the setup on a *nix distribution on that or just windows it's actually harder to do on macs so either waay u won't run into some big problems
What’s nix? Is that some Linux mumbo jumbo	LOL like unix linux cuz like ain't nobody know wtf cmd does me doing powershell over iap was probably the worst experience of my life lmao but like basically nix os make developing way easier cuz terminal commands work really easy and git isn't a mess wait but here's my rundown of what the move is: download ubuntu wsl (windows subsystem for linux?) and then it's basically like a mini os on top of windows and u can develop from there or i think git bash works fine too?
So I’m just gonna use cmd if that’s aight	lol if it works for you then it works for me how do u know how to use it tho that's wild
I had to use Mac terminal over IAP when I didn’t know how to use a Mac, git, or terminal Lol I don’t I just know how to use stack overflow	LMAO that's just called being big brain Eek That's the moce move
 	Lmk how it goes lol I don't think anybody's set it up on Windows yet
Bro what’s make	When u set up a program for the first time sometimes there's a makefile which specifies commands to run to make sure your environment is set up And it installs dependencies Depending on what the command after make is too
Would it install both the python and node dependencies at the same time? like “make installl “	Uh depends on whats in the makefile but it'd probably check for them and install if u didn't have Do u have the virtualenv set up
Yeah	Yeah make install should install node js If u don't have it alreafy
And requirements.txt?	Yeah the makefile pulls info from requirements.txt
Is make required to be used by all hack dev ppl Like is make references in all read me strips Setups	No Jason was just Fancy
Who dat	He's an alum Who started spectacle
Jason Kung?	Yeah
O dat boi interviewed me V big man	Lol Jason's great
Speaking of “V” Wtf is “vi”	Even tho he's all washed he still comes to all the hack stuff Lmao vi is like A barebones text editor Not even barebones But it's like vim Which is a command line text editor
So how is it used as a command e.g. “vi server/config.py” Can I just “python” dat config	"so any time you write vi or vim follwed by a file you're asking it to open that file in those text editors if you do python ""dat config"" you'll try to run the file with python you don't have to use vim yu can just open the file locally in any editor to edit it"
config.py doesn’t even exist Rip	it's a config.example file at first i thought if i remember then you need to modify it into a config.py
At first :o Ohhh Once u configure the credentials	yeah
You re-save it as a python file? Why not just make it a python file at first tho?	not sure u can i guess
Br	i think it's just to make sure u don't try to run the program with a dummy config
Uh Regardless I need the config vars tho	"oh yeah yeah let me go find mine DEBUG=True

F	it's not something to do w spectacle tho i think? maybe idk it's not relevant to the work we're doing yet so i'm just leaving it
is this what the beautiful spectacle should loook lik	lmao actually yes i commented out user profile and the search bar but if you uncomment those you'll see the beta features we're working on preferably uncomment them on your own branch tho ^well actually u should def do this lol
Speaking of branches I accidentally committed to master Sry oops Rookie mistake Beginner programmer mistake Oops 	LMAO uhhhh ok i can probably revert it ok i reverted them lol your commit messages will now forever be in git log history tho LOL
Is the spectacle submit button supposed to work	yeah what error are u getitng rn
405 method not allowed Actually	uh hmm
Missing cookie	oh
Accesstoken cookie	did u login
Oh I have to login	yeah if you're not allowed to make an account anymore just use the admin credentials on go/accounts
What f I get a big fat 500 error When trying to click login	oh f i know why it's because quill got redeployed for blueprint fffff let me ask shirlyn
Aigh	what's your localhost url 5000?
Ye	 this is the whitelisted url so that is what it should look like when u hit login ok so it's working on my machine which means there's something not quite right about yours lol
F My machine is quite hurt and offended	LOL can u send me a screenshot what happens when u just go to my.hackmit.org because i wonder if it's because you're not logged in already
Umm	oh i see did u just make this account
No	has it existed for a while hmm
Yeah	try an incognito tab
I mean I logged out But what admin account do I use	go/accounts the login for my.hackmit.org also what browser are u using
Chrome	for shirlyn's sake can u just try it on like firefox or smth
Row 3 or row 4 Bkueprint needs an email Neither seem to work lol	the dev tab on the bottom also i just realized u just send a picture of like 70% of our accounts over messenger lmfao
Solved  This looks better	Wowowo Lmao This is normal Do not worry
 yuh	There are always debugging things to do
Yeppppppp	What version of boto3 do u have
I think I added 1.00.0.0.00..000 To the requirements.txt	OK so Upgrade boto3
To?	pip install --upgrade boto3 It's like 1.12 something but That should take care of it
Take care of wat	I looked it up and boto3 may be causing the send request error
Got an integrity error I think that’s better Oh I can’t resubmit as the same user lol But I guess I did get the data thru to the backend And my token expired lol eh	Yeah Did u submit once befoee Oh Don't u just need to re sign I. If your toke. Expires
Yeah I did incognito	Mmm alright well That's jank So It kind of works now ?
Hahaha Good question That’s up to u when u do the PR review right ;)	WHAT DO U MEAN GOOD QUESTION Ong Omg Ok You know the placement charta You --> chaotic good
*me tryna understand this reference*	I am so sorry I didn't watch The office But This reference is good

box	omg omg you're that person i have a friend who does the exact same thing
wdym lol	the double react
nothing wrong with high self-esteem ;)	ok that's fair i agree very confident
I think from now on I’m just gonna react to all my messages but not yours then 	:oooo i can do the sam
>:(	triple angry ok what's yyour opinion on emojis bc i feel like u use them a lot and i just don't like i'll intentionally :DD just so it doesn't turn into the emoji
Well Some are the shit Like  But some emojis just aren’t it like :P =/=  : P*	what why are u doing this to me :p is the only one i use :p :p
Okay well if ur going for  and not : P Then it makes sense But I’m always : =	:pp
: P And seldom 	there's too much space :P :PP is more good
Lol if ur into multi-tongue faces and that’s ur thing I won’t judge	omg it's just an endearing lil :p
Doesn’t look like one tho :PP	:p boo you're no fun
:PP :PP :PP :PP :((	:pp to you too
>:( ^ *says she doesn’t like using emojis*	dude it turned :DD into :D ridiculous
Y’all rlly popping off what happened	Lol U should really use an email filter Its our CR emails Were obligated to cc sponsor@hackmit
Dam CR rlly going hard for the $$$ I guess	how else we gonna get the big bucks fr tho use an email filter or like 10 i have like 10 rules running on my inbox to separate my shit into folders lol how you kept your inbox so clean up until now is beyond me
Lmao I don’t This bothers me Ur that kinda guy huh	Ts p clean I used to be the exact opposite of that guy And then the emails kept coming So it was useless to mark them as read Piazza emails are there for the sentiment yanno
how long would it take you to mark them all as read tho or maybe you should just leave it like that for 4+ years and read them all at graduation	this life is all about time spent sir tbh i've given up it's the aesthetic now same with the gmail inbox that one makes the unread ones more obvious so i usually mass mark them as read but there's so much junk in there that i need to delete that i just don't lol did u just presume it would take >4 years for me to graduate
Idk MEng or no MEng Lol Ur a monster 	your usage of emojis startles me lol do u text jianna a lot wait do mengs attend two graduations or just oe one
only one way to find out Whenever I need to ask if a Hack Meeting is “optional”	omg your use of emojis is similar and creepy also hack meetings are never optional you should come to all of them!!!! all of this week's committee meetings were on tuesday this week lol it was a lot of hack in one day
Lol rlly 	oh no
 Lmao explanation pls	it's just unnervingly similar whenever i see emojis i always just imagine the person actually making those faces it's just half funny half weird
O lol sounds traumatizing 	omg please are u west coast
LMFAO Do I give of west coast vibes? Is this a complement?	Wait no sorry it's irrelevant to current topic I was just gonna say it's really late over here I just realized like 10 seconds ago I have 930 lab tmrw lol Is it trendy to be west cost these days Wait no u must be Boston area right Or at least new england
NY	Oh word ok Do u know the school trinity
Ejajajeerrrrrr Idk no Sounds famous And like a specialized school	Eh ig it's just one of the only schools where ik someone from In nhc NYC It's a private school it
Oooh priiiiivattttte	Omg go to sleep
U go sleep :app :PP I’m occcupied rn	Mboutta OK sir well try to at least maintain the semblance of a circadian rhythm Gn :pp
Is ur bday?	Is my bday
khpybdyjme 	Lollll thank you very much michael :DD hi so your next tasks for spectacle are to build a logout button, show a countdown for when submission due, and implement the search bar with filters for some of the things submitted in project details also do u want to do any backend work like flask endpoints cuz i was gonna have jianna do the set submission deadline in the settings table as a couple of endpoints but she has some frontend changes to make on the admin panel and julia needs that endpoint as well so it'd be nice to have that earlier than later
F I got a task	LOL apologies friend what r u up to this summer
Bumblefuck work in Bumblefuck, Virginia  O and dev tasks of course 	lol nice are u actually physically there
No Not nice What is there to do in Virginia? Lol I’d much rather stay in NY	wait what part of my q are u referring to or my response virginia is historically relevant
Yes I would’ve been down to go to Virginia in the 1700s But lmao now idk 	R u just bumming around at home then
Lol no I’ll be bumming around in Virginia F	oh so u are physically there
ye	oh sorry lol it could be fun you could explore the city
What city >: P >:P	the city in which u reside?
O lol Richmond is a city I guess It passes as a city lol  (Lowkey tho)	wait richmond is totally a city i've heard of it
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) sure sure	:] ugh not that : ] why does that turn into a smiley
:] Dam it does lol :3 I think auto emoji is annoying	it's not the move emojis were kind of the thing before but like now i am more in favor of :)))) :DDD :pppp
O lol I just add a space : ) Or use imessage	what is an iphone this means a totally different thing from :)))
wat how different	: ) this is like more clueless and derpy and :))) is just more like just wholesome smile
O lol That’s fine I think it fits our respective personalities : )	:)))
Don’t tell me u use android	well what am i supposed to tell u then u ever heard of moto it's a moto
Bro u have a Motorola? 	don't laugh at me
I’m ded	it's a perfectly well functioning moto don't be u still need to work
I could see this for u Using an Android moto lmao	it works very bueno
Yes yes I’m sure it does  	"wait it has some interesting features like there's one fingerprint sensor area that's like the iphone one but u can like use swipe gestures on it to get to all apps open tray and go back to be fair i didn't choose this my dad hates it when i buy anything that's like ""not a good deal"" so he like bought this for me when i was in hs i would have gotten a samsung tho so...."
Lol saem	my dad has been using my amazon prime like nonstop for the past 2 months + slickdeals it's like i could buy it but then he's like no u can't
Lmao sounds about right Asian parents	sad things
Explain Pls : D	Uh like writing some flask endpoints And modifying the db
Yeah but doing wut 🤔 What shld I write	Oh The settings endpoints Go spectacle-backend There's some details On setting db Mostly we just need a row for submission deadline
It’s already there tho	You can do it like soft or hard deadline but we really only need one Wait the endpoints for setting deadlines?
O endpoints There’s a An endpoint to update settings in general R u saying u want separate endpoints for each deadline?	Hmmm No that's fine for now then Let me talk to jianna about the admin panel first then
F O lol r u talking about endpoints in admin	yeah
Aight bet should I do	i don't think so actually jianna is just building the frontend hopefully works with those endpoints that one*
Aight she needs her Jwt auth right If she uses the settings endpoint ?	yeah she'll just sign in with admin user
aigh bet	lol thanks for showinn up michael
Bro Was goin on tho 	LOL so these people are hack alum and they know some of older team but usually techx organizes a sendoff for all the seniors that are graduating but this year they flaked so now we're trying to do this for seniors on hack except ik nobody either cuz i joined last fall
Lol same Not same Same	LOL it's aight just chilll and do something while u listen to this
Aight already got that covered ^ clearly u r also busy too lol	LOL i should have turned off the video F
Lol u learned ur lesssson Ur prob the kid that always had their video on at every zoom lecture 🤔🤔🤔which means ur prob the kid that sits in the front of every lecture and recitation	can u not call me out i'm not a front row kid i'm like a second row slightly off center kind of kid and I NEVER HAD SYNC LECTURE AFTER COMING BACK lowkey kind of sad
Ok like second place nerddddddd 🤓🤓🤓 :ρ	:(( there's nothing wrong with being a nerd it's like not too full nerd
That’s something nrdz say Yo :Ρ ^ I’m a genius	i'll own it but i'm not that nerdy
Bro u have a medium blog Thaz like +10 🤓 Good articles But still +10 🤓	haha waHT? how does this contribute to my being nerdy if anything this makes me a literary +10 🤓 ok jk my writing is a work in progress but it's nice that u know it exists
Bruhhhhh Medium Is literally People writing articles dedicated entirely to coding For the most part	"no i meant MY MEDIUM and I DON""T WRITE ABOUT CODING"
Lmao  we appreciate Dw we all lowkey 🤓🤓 tho	^thank u very much for the support
Yes yes of course  When is ur next article tho 🤔	uh i had liek two more after the first one but they weren't very good so i didn't pub them i kinda just write whenever i have the inspiration post 2 am vibes like
Bro wdym u have three articles on ur profile lol	oh yeah those are the two more after the first one those were all my post 2am vibes ok what's your recommendationa bout somthing i should write about next i'm not exaclty living a frivolous life atm
Write about being an MIT kid (and why you choose to sit in the second row at every lecture) I hear the college clout lifestyle vlogs ‘n blogs are popular with the kidz these dayz 🦡	LOL i can assure you i don't have enough lifestyle i would vlog if i went on a trip tho u just reminded me that i should courseroad what classes r u taking next sem
Lol u funny thinking I plan that far ahead	well let me try again are u majoring in 6-3
uh o do i give of 63 vibes :\	uh o are u not there's no such thing as a 63 vibe
wdym uh o >:(	like over 50% of the school is 63 there's no vibes it's just everybody u said uh o so i said uh o
lmao 6-2 i thonk fight mee >:(	yo i thought u were gonna be like 17 or 14 or smth and totally shock me ok 6-2 is are you more of a 6-1 6-2 or a 6-3 6-2 lowkey cnosidered 6-2 for a while msyelf
Uh o	what's the pub for 6-2
Do I give off 17 or 14 vibes	no i just thought you were gonna or i was gonna be way off about your ~vibes~ oh that's not what i wanted ~ vibes ~ why does it cross it out
6.21 6-2.1 I was mainly a software kid 🤓until high school	I was just a kid kid until college 🤓 Only .1 Shouldn't this be more 6-2.45
Lollll y u think That Mayb u rite	ofc i am always
Lmao okayyyyyyy Clearly humility is ur forté 	what's the adjective for humility humilitious
I too Am extraordinarily humble by the way ;)	okay ;) i ;) believe ;) you why did you put a screenshot of my text in your PRRRRRRR
Don’t reinvent the wheel - good coding practices	omggg ok these memes are like 2007 btw you're like the first person i've seen in years use these
Yes they old But they’re classy	"Omg ""classy"" Wait who's this"
:; :( Neil deGrasse Tyson?	Oh what
Bruh he’s an icon	Ok I kind of see it
R u fr rn 	I could never imagine him making that pose tho No I know who he issss Stoppppppppp
 For ur reference	LOL thank u for finding this for me I'll watch this diligently
Yeah lmk when u find it	LOL WOW Ok for Isaac Newton do u test spectacle with just the frontend url like do you try building and running on the flask server
If ur doing purely frontend work just frontend url localhost:3000 But if i need backend queries and data I build and run	ok so i'm noticing a problem
Usually I just build and run Fuq	with frontend and backend server difference after building a lot of the stuff won't update until page refresh which is kind of unfortunate
Like U change the code And the page doesn’t auto refresh?	no like after login the projects don't populate immediately you have to refresh the page same thing for the team dropdown and now i'm starting to think it has to do with the way react router dom prop shit and redirects are compiled for build
O shit U rite	lol i didn't notice when i merged your PR in so now we have this on master but it's fine julia's thing is like that too
It’s prob not requerying Godam	same thing for the teamdropdown so i'm enlisting your help now on this task
Dam This was all a scheme To give me another dev task	lolllllll
I thought I was helping u lol	ofc u are you're helping me fix spectacle oh what the teamdropdown is showing correctly on master but not on julia's branch but i don't notice any code differences oh i see there's no if else anymore if you'r'e doing any like conditional checks to decide what to render then that's probably not happening on redirect
Does project view Use backend? Teamdropdown*	yeah oh uh
Does it use a fetch	yes lol yes it does
Whereeeee	oh not on master because it's not autopopulating data u can check julia's branch
Which one	julia/user-profile
K I fixed mine I think	what'd u change
good question so after login it redirects to [rootURL]/success etc. so to get a proper query to the api URL i had to ../../../../../../../../ for my fetch URL u could prob try the same for julia's ../../../../../ spam ima make another pr	wait i'm confused
ye wuddup	ok nvm just push to your branch and i'll look at what u did
like ur at root url localhost:5000 then u login then after succcess, if u look at the web URL it goes to localhost:5000/success which is when the query is made but localhost:5000/success/api/blahblahblah is not a valid API query route so when u make a fetch query, you add ../../../ to backtrack from localhost:5000/success out of /success to localhost:5000 and then u can add /api/blahblahblah for a successful query	Oh r u doing that from loginview
no app.js	hmm ok
Kind of an ugly solution but who looks at source code anyways 	wait does your search still work then cuz if you're doing like immediately searchProjects from the exact path login/success that eventually redirects to root i think that loginview is the problem here cuz it tries to redirect to root but probably not getting registered by the browserrouter
Well it does eventually go to route Hmm Search seems to be fine So /login/success has no content to display But the query for projects is made in App.js and not LoginView.js	how is it making like future fetches then cuz like i feel that that is kind of jank i just talked to justin about it and basically
Wat this mean	when u send a redirect from loginview we can just pass in some props that tell root to make some api calls
Yes Hmm	sorry this was just my previous question about how future searches would work ignore it
R u saying that fetches should not be made not in App?	no like they should be but only when u recognize that the redirect has occurred
O Wait	so like what you and julia are probably both trying to do is make the fetches too early while you're still at login/success
So on my part It’s because the fetches occur when App Mounts	also do you make that fetch every time u hit enter for search
Lol maybe I hope we’re not getting charged for http queries So even if the url is at login/success, it will still make a fetch because App is mounting	wait can u not just modify which projectcards are displayed
I figured lowkey	wait hold on let me think about this
The backend would be much more efficient with queries even with http latency Than whatever shitty death algorithm I make Because I haven’t taken 006 yet Search algorithm*	lol it's not that useful for practical use cases like this anyways nobody wants to make an avl tree for queries yeah ok ughhhhh i barely understand react and now there's so many thingssss ok wait let me think
Nobody do 🦡	anyways we should probably not use the ../../ to make the fetch call
Fuck Well U kinda need ../../ in some places Because the backend has the same route URL as the frontend Anytime u need to make a backend query And ur not at the root URL you have to ../../ to get to the api Until we get like an actual webpage domain url Then we don’t have to use relative paths	that's fair but like
Yes it’s very fair :)	going back to my question from before like doesn't search use that fetch call multiple times and not always when you're at /login/success so how does it still work when you're at root
Search?	when u have .//.// in the call
Oh Lol	to fetch projects
../../../ on root —> root You can’t go back further than root It’s The *Root*	well yes that's what i mean by jank also something funny i just noticed does your shared photos with your other friends look like this to or am i just worthy of these reactions more than others  here's the link justin sent me tho i gtg now but i'll keep looking at this tmrw and see if there's like a cleaner way we can do all this
Does this mean Nvm lol	omg i feel like i knkow what you were about to say i apologize michael i didn't mean to do u dirty like that LOL
"Lol wut 🤔🤔🤔 Unless
   🥺
"	"🥺
 oh wow 🥺
  ah it doesn't center what does this mean tho"
What does this mean tho	oh maybe not then
>:(	i thought u were gonna make a pun and be like does this mean i'm dirty anyways on redirects all components rendered re mount right or not
Lol I thought I was getting another dev task	like when u redirect to / and pass in a component view oh
"Unless 
   🥺
"	well i would appreciate if u could help me do this but if not i'll just flail about endlessly it's fine anywyas
So like	do the components re mount
So Since the login Page Is a separate domain Project thingy Not localhost App.js remounts once the login is successful	right but when loginview sends the redirect to / does projectsview remount again since that's like the path in route
Yes they do Wait	so can u do a componentdidmount and make a fetch call from projectsview will just like all of the porjects
U mean Fetch projects from projects view instead of app? Like What do u want to change rn	yeah so like every time projectsview remounts make a fetch call and get alll projects for display but you've moved it up to app.js i see
Err ProjectView is just to show one project	right but i mean like projectsview
O	cuz that gets rerendered every time you go to root right
U right So like move the queries to there?	eh i think since there's stuff outside the routes we can just pass in some props from the redirect to force those fetches from app.js directly
Aight that makes sense	yeah hopefully that'll help liek teamdropdown too i'll check how to do it tmrw
Wait wdym	like teamdropdown isn't affected by the route it's just in the menu bar so like you can't induce it to change by doing a componentdidmount or anything like that right unless u refresh the whole page
Yes troo	ok i think i kind of have a better sense of what we have to do now whew thought all hope was lost there for a second i'm gonna go shower but i'll keep this in my noggin
Umm Problem I can get the projects in ProjectView instead of App.js But for the search functionality	Wait do u mean projectsview Yeah the search needs to happen from app js Is it bad practice to separate the fetches lol
Well R u saying Fetch in app.js solely for searching?	Like Make fetches from app And from projectsview For the same projects So then u have to maintain projects across both
Updated PR Wait so what r ur thoughts on having the countdown timer queries in app.js tho? Now that project queries have been moved Oke fine i did it anyways 	aha what let me look oh i see what u did that looks really good i'm about to test ti oh bueno it looks good
lol nope	hi what
u at rn ?	what am i at
u at rn ?	i'm so confused
lol oh lol no	Hi Is there any chance
why	That you are Drunk High
lol do u have that ?	Or both
get the look of so tired	Uh
lol u do u	I am not that tired yet But Sure
get there by d e d	Ok are we having an actual conversation rn or am I getting trolled Lol what is going on
yes	Ok Cool
remind me in person then u r worthy	Just wanted to make sure we were on the same page OK
lol no u	Will do

The video chat ended.	The video chat ended. forgot to ask should i consider running for vp of finance in startlabs
Are there other positions?	yes but i haven't participated in any of their team meetings there's web, large events, tech treks, internal development and marketing finance is like sponsorships and cr stuff
Are you interested in large events?	they do logistics and planning for entrepreneurship events it's not that interesting to me to actually plan the events just tedious time consuming work imo
OK, how about tech trek? What is it?	they organize the travels to different entrepreneurship places like the trip to germany over spring break and there's also another to ny over iap also just a lot of planning in my opinion u get to talk to some companies about visiting them yeah but is just a visit the thing is tho i think i only have a good chance with finance bc the team is so small and i've been to some of their meetings
My thinking is u r a freshman may have to pay your due first doing some tedious work	they're all tedious work tho and it's a position tho like vp of smth is always tedious work tho i'd have to join a team permanently anyways so i was thinking finance bc i don't think i'd be interested in doing the tedious work for any of the rest of the teams and i don't need to do web bc i have hack already
What does finance VP do?	at least that way i can have some contacts and some companies Connect with sponsors and secure company funding. Apply for grants and school funding sources. Develop sponsorship packages to offer prospective companies. is the official description just like obtaining sponsorships/funding
OK, sounds good	So should I go for it?

Do you know what we’re doing in FLP	no clue to be honest it's supposed be like bonding and deep talks?
I looked on reddit and apparently there’s 5 AM swims in the lake???	oh man that's an early time to be living
Ikr I just don’t know what to bring to wear My mom’s making me pack everything I’m bringing to FLP on top	r ur parents going up with you early and waiting for orientation i'm flying up with only the basic stuff i need to move in and my fpop clothes and items my parents are bringing the rest on the 24th and when i get back on the 25th i'll move in with them because my last name is fu i think i'm going to miss the swim test so i'll just take the makeup on the 29th
^^ Oof	yeah i wanted to get it over with
I’m flying in with a big suitcase, a small suitcase, a duffel and a backpack So not a lot	on the off chance we get back around 12 or 1230 or something i'll take it but if not i guess i'll have to take it after my ase
Rip I haven’t swam in two years	oh wait that's on the 30th eh that's not too bad then
But I think I can do 100 m	i practiced like 4 times a couple weeks ago
Wait what you practiced for this lmao	it was actually hard at first lmao yeah also if i can i'll try the boat test too to see if i can do sailing this fall which btw if u wanna try w me
Wtf is the boat test	yeah i'm going with a big suitcase a duffel and a backpack
Is that a thing???	no small suitcase only one carry on yeah if u want to do like in water things like sailing u have to tread water for 10 minutes which i absolutely cannot do but like whatever it doesn't hurt to try maybe i will miraculously get better
Wtf that is such a killer core workout It’s not mandatory though right	"no only the swim test is like ""mandatory"""
So you want to do rowing or something Is that why you’re doing the sailing test	no i want to try sailing if i don't pass i'm going for pistol
wow damn you really trying to expand your horizons	pirate certificate is the added bonus
oh i see	yeah i want to try some new stuff
apparently that was going around the wechat group	oh yeah it was

really lol do you guys get together and all work at once or do it mostly independently	yeah it's hella fun lol uhhhh depends our meetings are like usually just talking about week plans but we have gsds to do work together too
ok whats the time commitment for dev	gets kind of busy the week or two before events usually not too bad a few hours a week
did you know react native and node.js before	i still don't know either of them lmfao also we usually use react.js not native my goal is to learn node but ik flask decently now i do like backend work and speccing for spectacle lmao we need more frontends tho!
lol i told them i'm more interested in full stack do you need any of those lol also do we get meet the teams tmrw	uh well full stack is frontend and backend work so that's good yeah everybody will be there tomorrow hey mindy just wanted to let you know that 1on1s are canceled this friday and saturday :(( lmk if you need anything or you just wanna talk - hope everything goes well in the next few weeks for you and stay safe!

yoo i am now ready to talk	oh u meant 1pm edt right ok i'm on go/zoom
yo jamie audrey li and i have a startup idea we're going to work on over the summer and we need some backend developers essentially we want to build a platform for ppl to pub events/opportunities to a more targeted audience e.g. hackmit recruiting underrepresented regions we're wondering if you're interested in this humble opportunity also lmk if you have more questions we've applied for sandbox funding and we're going to apply for the mozilla mvp program	oooh v v cool what kind of work are u thinking for backend
flask/postgresql similar to hack's stuff but honestly many things could work	oh cool yeah i'd be down i'd love to help in the design/innovation of the platform too just off the top of my head i'm wondering about what sort of ideas you guys already have for how the platform is going to be designed as - like facebook group style or like subscription list style seems p interesting
yayyyy ok yeah i guess i can explain some more about that rn we're envisioning a virtual postings board like the one you see in the infinite how it works is that users will have to make an account and fill out name, email, school, geographic region, ethnicity, fields of interest, major, etc and once you have an acct you can receive email notifications for event registration links and also pub out events we're also planning to make ppl register their registration links with BreadBasket (thats what we're calling it) to encourage ppl to make accts so for example if they wanted to share the event to other ppl they know they wouldn't just forward a google form and bypass us i think we're aiming for a mvp (minimum viable product) in 3-4 weeks, send it out to ppl to test, get feedback, update and when it looks adequately deployable pivot toward marketing and advertising a lot let me make a gc with everyone so far	hmm cool is there like a specific target market you're aiming for because i feel like facebook events does geographic location pubbing well and friends suffice for sharing
yeah so we're looking to target students specifically rn	i like the idea of event registration through it tho that makes sense
but we've also talked about directing this for company recruiting as well	it'd be nice to have events consolidated though i'd agree
and expanding it to be more general like a students craigslist so like if in boston someones graduating and wants to sell their furniture	like justin's dormsp.am thing is p cool but it just does email scraping but this should be like entirely new thing where users create their accounts right and pub events separate from like facebook events and not liniked oh that's a good idea
yeah	you could probably specify needs and wants right
the main thing is that fb and linkedin limit you to your friends so like hackmit we want to try to get ppl from underrepresented schools like small liberal arts schools	"like ""recruting, campus events, buying/reselling"""
but like if none of us really know anyone from those schools we could post on fb and hope for shares or we could directly reach out to a network of ppl online thats not limited by friends or connections	yeah i see that makes a lot of sense have u seen the outlit app oh u must have u know christian
oh yeah from flp outlit is like events around campus right	yee it's p similar but the idea is like geographic and time-based pubbing so it's a bit different but i think it could be useful to draw inspo anyways it sounds exciting glad to be a part of the team lol
yay ok thanks for joining! disclaimer: we're not aiming for like big bank but we're still going to take this seriously and see how far we can get	yeah i see you ig my only disclaimer is that i'm doing a fulltime remote urop and my prof sounds crazy so in the case that he overloads me i may become hOseD so fingers crossed
yikes yeah honestly same i'm going to be uroping with jianna's professor and we're going to have zoom meetings everyday but i feel like i'm stuck in the same place everyday i can dig out time after work to do this	uh what you and i have the same urop LOL
wait with tegmark??	jianna told me she was gonna drop WUT yeah bro OH LIT
WHAT LMAO wait this is crazy lolllll	dude tegmark is actually so weird sometimes he keeps talking to me in chinese like he'll just throw in some chinese phrases here and there
wait no same during my interview with him	lol holy
i told him i read spanish newspapers and he starts talking to me in spanish then he switches over to chinese	to be good at another language wow wait something i just thought of
"and i'm just like ""“"	LOLLLLLL holy i was just gonna ask tho do u still keep in touch with that guy from colombia
bruh no lmao	wait i can't remember is this like bad terms or just out of touch
out of touch lol	oh ok good i was like ??? is there smth i'm missing
i lost contact with my iap italian students already too lol yeah no i'm just decently bad at keeping in touch over extended periods of time	yeah rip same tbh i haven't been in touch with the matt shania aditi seba gang in a while seba i sometimes talk to but like aditi is like mia on messenger and i just don't talk to matt or shania at all
wait i'm honestly so surprised they're still so close i feel like they go on vacations together every break yeah don't they all go to school on the west coast	yeee i think zach and matt are really close even tho zach is at duke but there were like that at camp too so it's to be expected
damn i mean si young and i were pretty close and we still are so thats sort of similar? wait who was your sstp roommate	ally oof i have not talked to her she's at berkely tho and she's doing really well you also room together so
yeah lmao but we kept in touch like during hs as well	ohh lol yeah fair fair
wait yo whats the ssh password do i type the little asteriks	D1D1C0 for the last few digits that are asterisks
ok got it thanks	did it work
yeah	nice
where are we writing what rn i'm so lost	on the spreadsheet another tab dude this urop lmfao
wait yeah i didn't expect this to be like 10 ppl	yeah lol i mean more people on a project means more divided work at least
true bro this guy hes too excited	I KNOW wtf i'm so glad i told him i couldn't start until june 1 i have some meetings this afternoon so idek if i can make the later ones today HOLY
i told him i'll start on monday but i'm pretty sure he wants me to start today he sounded so disappointed when i told him lol what	dude he's been making me nervous since i interviewed w him
wait out of curiosity when did you interview with him	but this work was more interesting than the other urop i interviewed for
he interviewed me like day after posting	lowkey same i interviewed with him like a day after i emailed him
interesting	why lol whats up he pushed for an answer like half a day after i interviewed too
no bc when he talked to me he said he interviewed 35 kids already 2 days after the posting had been up but today he said there were 100+ applicants so i'm wondering if there were like waves of recruitment	oh yeah he said he's been getting lots of applications yeah i'm not sure if that's a stretch and he's just like trying to make us feel special lol so we do more work
this is emotional manipulation	dude literally also there's homework now every day too nice
DON'T CALL IT HOMEWORK	to be fair i don't read the news as much as i nearly should so like ig it's positive work
i read too much news lol	"WE""LL NEVER ESCAPE"
the worst part is a recruiter contacted me like two days ago and was like hey do you still want to wokr for us and now i'm like ...	ooh damn mindy getting that bank yeah idk what you're gonna do u could take on both and just pretend like the other doesn't exist what company is it
yeah but breadbasket is prob going to be some work its called altair its like a data management firm or something	oh they're headquartered in troy michigan nice
yeah lol but its remote	yeah go figure lol
i looked on glassdoor and it says the work is really chill??? idk if that'll be true we'll see i haven't given them a solid response yet	lolll hmm well try to enjoy the summer while we can
yeah honestly now i can't even roadtrip to mexico over the summer smh	ugh yeah i literally haven't seen any four people in person other than my family for the last 3 months like this is not even a joke all i want to do is not work holy
did school ending help at all or nah	Yes lol yesterday was like my freedom evening
yayyy a small reprieve	Lol wbu what r u up to now
i've been reading and writing gotta finish my books before the concrete that is tegmark hits	LMAO you are a true literary
i try (': if claire and and jianna are right and it is your birthday, happy birthday!!!!	yeahh haha it is (or was? idk timezones) thanks mindy
so this popped up in my inbox this morning honestly i'm pretty annoyed/mad	oh huh she didn't tell me anything about u guys idc about being cto but it's interesting that she said you are coo
this literally just popped up like we never talked about this before	i also think it's a little early to be deciding c suite before we have a product
yeah honestly	i'm fine that we're cofounders together
and dm'ing me??? at least send it to the chat bro	i told her i was aight w it but yeah i thought she talked to u about it too before
nope	so i was like aight maybe she dmed me for that purpose
wait did she dm you this morning	yeah i responded recently but i don't think she's seen it yet
so she only mentioned the cto to you interesting	yeah i thought she would tell me yours too so i was going to ask her i can mention to her that we might want to discuss it more if u want
i think its ok i already told her we should talk about it together next week also i talked with her yesterday and she was already talking about outsourcing implementing web design to others and i was like no we don't need that its just css apparently she talked to like 10+ other ppl already to gauge their proficiency in html/css	oh lol uh i mean sure we have the vision but i consider it more useful if i do some coding as well besides it shouldn't be all html css
"i'm just ranting now but i was internally like ""ik youre new to webdev and everything but can you really not learn some css to do this"""	loll
like me and you are going to be doing the heavy lifting on the tech side and really theres no investors to attract rn so please help us out	i mean yeah i think she's trying to angle herself from the business perspective but i think it also presumes we have no knowledge of it imo she needs to have more of a sense of urgency or providing value
"i think she gets the sense of urgency of ""providing value"" but instead of doing it herself shes trying to outsource it bc she thinks its too tiresome or smthng like learning css is a hassle i mean i'm new to web dev too but i don't just look for the easy way out"	yeah i mean i think the idea is that you have to get your hands dirty to have ownership of a product and this is like a learning experience
mmhm i talked her into waiting on outsourcing until after mvp is released theres really no reason for a startup to be hiring ppl so early	what money do we have
"she was like ""oh we have 1000 and we said 500 for engineering so we might as well use it"" and i'm like ..."	oh i mean idk what kind of hiring she's thinking of doing with 500 tho
ikr thats gone with a single 40 hr week	dude also i literally hate myself for speaking up about this shit dataset over and over he just keeps giving me work to process it when i don't need to make a histogram to tell u the dataset is shit i can't help it tho the dataset is shit and i have to say it and then he's like but wait how shit is it
wait i zoned out lol but he made you make a histogram to illustrate a dataset??? tf	NO hes making me do it over the weekend cuz jianna brought up that we reprocessed the dataset she made it sound too easy f the way u get around profs is by making the bare minimum sound like work anyways after that he was like oh did u find anything about the labels and i was like nooo it's normal to be like that and then he was like but wait is it can u make sure it's normal that our shit is this shitty anyways that's all i have to say
we should make a tegmark rant chat with jianna	LOLLL dude i was so scared she shared screen last time and our chat was behind her main screen she lowkey got outed
HAHAHAHA I'M DEAD	but my messages were behind the other window SHE ALWAYS SHARES HER WHOLE SCREEN NOT AN APP WINDOW it's actually so nerveracking i always go like this:
NO JIANNA	... . . .
ZOOM HACKS	to make the message go away LOL
i quit messenger before every time i screen share	LOL smart i haven't been asked to share screen in a while thank god
also i muted myself for a couple seconds as i took the screenshot of the audrey chat so tegmark wouldn't think i was idk super into someone else's data yeah lol he focused too much on you guys today	lol wait what why would u make noise while u screenshotted
wait it takes all the background noise oh i'm on mac	ohhh i see lolll why does he do this
idk he got excited khaled and sam hyped him up too much	ahaha ikr idk about khaled but sam inside is secretly just as annoyed as we are at least half of the peoplein this lab are let's see who i've talked to during lab meetings arun sam jianna u who else
she sounded pretty annoyed during twop yesterday lol also i really hate to say this but emilys voice low key annoys me actually maybe not even low key	LOL
wait is arun annoyed too lol i can't tell with that guy	"arun is like ""is it just me or does emily like to drag on meetings"" yeah arun is not that annoyed but lowkey annoyed at tegmark he's a mild guy tho so i can't even rant that much to him"
tti i don't think emily intentionally drags on meetings	emily is even more of an oversharer than i am
shes just doing it unconsciously by egging him on	I KNOW they feed off of each other's energy
"tegmark is sometime annoyed by emily too i can feel it like way too many ""wait thats so cool!"" ""whoaaaa"""	LOLLLLL emily is someone that always feels like on the verge of a breakdown oh btw once u put the boilerplate down when we start iterating can u make a feature branch we're both working on different components of the app so i think both of working on master is fine but later it might cause issues
oof ok i thought i was on develop but guess not yeah i'll checkout feature	wait no there's no develop branch yet also i just pulled your recent stuff did u just copy over the stuff from the old repo cuz there's still a lot of tsx files i'm seeing it's ok if they're tsx i think but i'm not sure if they'll build properly cuz i think .js endings are more up to date
yeah i just copied stuff from the old repo i should've pushed everything on master wait are we not using tsx	it's the same thing but the endings are different let's use js haha
ok lol tsx is a hassle on the react end	yeah is it hard to convert
yes lol but its ok bc i think its only App.tsx all my components are js	oh wait u only copied over from src right
yeah	cuz there was some package set up in the client directory that i was hoping not to overwrite oh ok gr8 haha we can go through and prune kevin's extra set up files later lol
wait what are you waiting for exactly so ik what to work on first	oh no i'm not waiting for anything lol u can prune them if u want i just finished making the db models i'm going to test if it actually makes the db properly or if i have to go in and make them myself and then i'll build some rudimentary endpoints so u can start tested and connecting your frontend stuff
cool ok also can you send me the correct config.py arguments so i can connect to the db correctly	yep  password is bready
i like the creativity	lol how are u planning on deciding from root whether to display home page or login/signup page? session cookies?
umm i think so i haven't done this before so i'm going to start doing user login stuff tmrw	yeah all good lol i'm learning react rn too lmk if i can hep have u accepted sandbox yet
yup wait you're learning react now i might need your help lol	yeah i didn't do that much but i understand the structure of the code and have contributed an itty bitty bit to spectacle frontend so far my endpoints are almost all written tho i'll push tn
i'll start working with api calls next week i need to get user state set up this weekend	not sure what this means but yes
basically signing in + passing data across pages but if you want to help with some itty bitty design i have a skeleton for all the pages but the launch page i'm trying to figure out how i want to display the posts but i can also push tn and you can try to pretty some things up if you want	haha oh no i'm so awful at ux and design
its not too big of a priority for now but i don't want the website to look like crap yo same	but i think it'll be helpful lif u use an ui framework like semantic or material ik you're using react bootstrap
yeah i just discovered material	but semantic makes things really easy
yeah so rn i'm weighing semantic vs material will finish basic ui  aka landing page tn i'm considering bringing on a designer bc we suck at this but we'll talk about that later	a lot of dev team prefers semantic tho lol interesting
yeah i noticed but i don't like the ui lol	i mean we're not awful at design oh huh lol
we're not awful but once we start marketing	right
and like pitching presentations to investors	that will be a problem
yeah hows your other sandbox startup doing	oh yeah i haven't talked about it with them at all nothing has happened it's chill lol
nice lol how much funding did you guys get	just 500 lol they threw together the budget last minute i didn't fill it out
damn ok so we don't even have it that bad	yeah also apparently we all have to fill out the acceptance form so u should tell audrey asap
Yeah I’ll just post in the chat	also what are we going to do about an orientation the orientation during our daily zoom meeting plus i have another thing at 12pm too that day so that's like 3 things i have to work around
I’m going to dip on tegmark What’s the priority on your other thing	it's like a one time thing so i kinda want to go i mean theres an option that u can say i can't go so i selected that for my other sandbox and i'm just gonna see what they say and same here
Yeah I’m prob going to go Bc I think I should be there at least lol Also no way Audrey is going She’s in china	oh yeah rip haha oh that's a good idea oop
Dude I’m actually so pissed Audrey just told me “Yeah talked it over with and she’s ok with it!! ((: “Let’s talk about shares next meeting!”	hmm yeah i just agreed with being cto not anything else just cuz id c ok i told her that we should probably discuss together since there's some confusion
ok this is getting ridiculous	hmm yeah i don't really like that she's trying to do shares when we have zero shares atm
our shares are nonexistent if we don't do any work	i think you should just move our discussion to the group chat since she's trying to target us individually
"i am outraged like actually outraged can you say in the gc that you agree with me and we should discuss it together just like ""yeah i think we should wait until thursday and talk about this together"""	i mean i'll just give my own input but yeah i essentially agree that this doesn't make sense to be decided now
i am so pissed rn wtf is she thinking should i talk to jack about this doesn't he have extensive startup experience	uh yeah but he was a cofounding engineer and i don't think they focuses too much on these title s to me it seems like she's trying to take a bite of our cake before she's added the flour to it let's keep it civil btw ok i'm not responding anymore it's up to you
yeah ok i was just eating yo jamie are you free rn/in 15 min	Let's us two call separately Rn
Ok  yo	Be on in two
Wait can we talk rn	sure back on your link?
	Breadbasket*
Oops lol I just replied again	Lol

So this is what my friend at Yale told me	Yeah I may habe Oh yeah I know It's p bad
Wtf	I haven't been in touch w him for a while
Has he always been a jerk	He doesn't sound like he's doing too well tho No he's Always been like a very large pippy puppy So that's why I was shocked I could tell he was kind of insensitive and unaware at times But I never thought it would go that far
Wtf Damn ok	Who's your friend at yalr
His names sukesh Idk if you know him	Oh I don't know him but we have a lot of mutuals
Oh really lmao It’s a small world	All these college kids end up knowing each other at some ooint

Wait I feel it’s so hard to know more ppl after freshman year	Noooo don't say that I need to try

Wait in my state that’s like a lock for stanford Bc it’s az Lack of talent	Basis tho what All dem asians
Wait basis is complete shit It’s degenerating Their golden age has passed	Ooof Heard it's toxic
It depends on the basis but yeah My mit pal was this basis Scottsdale girl She gave me all the tea	Ooooh damnnn She really just did that huh
Yup “I’m not committing to stanford Bc all the fakes go there”	AYE
Glad we feel the same way lol Stanford is a fake school	Haha I always just think duck when I hear them

yeah -- last year at the beginning i think we started by signing  HackMIT Corporate Relations	ok
so either works	Hey it's my brothers birthday today lol so we're eating dinner together I'm prob gonna be late
okay! were probably going to end early but its totally fine!	Ah rip OK
we're still going on tho rn lol	OK I'll join in a sec this is nit but the location at the top of the sponsordoc still saya MIT campus
oop missed that lol i can change it	lol yeah i just noticed cuz my mom was asking about sponsorship also do we have a plan for nonprofits to support hack cuz they don't really get recruiting benefits but it'd be nice to have them there slash professional orgs like aspirations or whatever
i think we discussed having them related to the tracks or something as additional resources but yeah we can probably talk about it next meeting	ok sure
Hey Jamie! idk if you were interested in attending the outreach meeting but its happening now and wed love to have you and your ideas:))	Oh rip lol I've been away from my phone for a while yeah let me hop on in a bit how do i use zendesk to do mail merge thingies and mass email all my new contacts also what was the site to find recruiter emails again
shoot so srry but you have to add a contact to the deal in order for the mail to merge (if youve already connected your email) its take awhile for the deal to then sync with all related emails so you may have to wait a few min rocketreach or hunter.io both are good!	ok i'll try this later today i haven't set up the mail merge either rip
oh its alright -- its a lil time consuming were you able to connect your email to zendesk?	haha no i wanted to try with my mit email so i figured a decent chunk of time to do that
oh umm yea -- i can try to look into it today	figured i needed* yeah i'll look today too idk why days since last communication isn't updating but i've sent emails to almost all my need to contacts i'm missing info from a few companies that i just have not found on rocketreach and i ran out of searches so i'm gonna need to make a new account once they stop asking me for my phone number
Oh rip — could you update your zendesk pipeline? Also i saw that infosys was interested in a call — did they ever get back to you with a time?	Yep I moved all companies I emailed to initial email They didn't That's from a while ago So He ghosted me after that So im bumping him again so turns out twitter doesn't sponsor hackathons unless they're diversity focused
yeah i saw that :/	Yeah sad I sent like 7 emails to the original Twitter contact and finally she got annoyed enough to forward the info along does your recent message in cr mean we should schedule bumps for next monday
yeah it was just a reminder that bumps should be scheduled for monday	got it lol nadia can u halp i'm asking neha for eli lilly rn but the other ones i cannot find and/or am getting roasted by hunter and rocketreach all the emails i'm trying to use are rejecting me even my own personal ones F
give me a sec but yeah i can help you find some! megan pitts - megan.pitts@pathai.com srry megan.pitts@pathai.com for pathai mark.s@chevron.com for chevron what emails have you tried for pany.ai, revolut, and paradigm jamespeng@pony.ai for pony.ai	the chevron email to johnette bounced and then i was just not allowed to search anymore on rocketreach and hunter so
oh sad;(	i'm trying to figure that out lol
matt@paradigm.xyz for paradigm	thank u tho haha hopefully this is a temp thing i just want to make sure i have them for tmrw
yeah np! you still need revolut tho right	oh yes if u have
LMAO BOTHER EM ALWAYS ILY yes learning communities are fire i am not in one but i wish i had joined no traditional advising doesnt hurt at all sometimes the advising groups are bullshit lol	There's only like 3 or 4 learning communities right
mine got cancelled midway through because people weren't showing up	Like the advising sems? Lmao damn
it was cool in theory (visiting labs and companies around town) except i was hella busy so i couldnt make it yeah only a couple learning communitites i recommend esg try and get an advisor who fits your major/interests	Got it
i made the mistake of picking a rando	Lmfao
and he was rly nice but not helpful w the questions i had	Rando
hahaha	What about concourse Do u know anything about that I heard it's like Discussions about impact of science on humanity But There's like a weekly sem and stiff that seem kind of Tim consuming
ive heard its good, but i have friends in esg who LOVE it so i know mostly abt that yeah but its all during ur pass/fail semester lol u can fuck around then	Oh wait these advising things are only first semester??? Wait why am I so lost lmfao
haha wait so the advising seminars are first sem you'll still have that advisor second sem, but they don't do anything except approve your courseloads and are there for questions about stuff	Ohhhhhh
so the main advantage of learning comm in my opinion are 1) in build friend groups + pset buddies 2) smaller class sizes 3) more attention from prof, etc for example, my diff eq class has 350 people the esg one has like 40	What the FUCK
hahaha i mean only 100 or so show up to lecture but still	OK wait I was finna just take diff eq as lecture hall but now WOW
dude our diff eq prof was not good	I feel like it's like culture shock hitting me in the face
i learned everything through textbook hahahhaha	Bro I already took diff eq dual enrolled but U KNOW I DIDNT LEARN SHIT
ah ok thats really good so take diff eq in the fall its much much worse in the spring	Okay thank u for the advice
also wait do u know what major u are	6 probably 15 minor
lmao sellout	why did I know u were gonna say something like that
LOL sorry its k im  6 too ok talk to me when u prereg for classes i have much to tell u	Oooh omg I'm kind of excited already lmfao
HAHA	Your advice has actually been so helpful tho
nice good!!	So I'll try for esg and maybe concourse then
i have lots to share after lots of mistakes made	Aha omfg ita okay tho right everything is still working out??
hmm questionable oh are u doing an fpop	Lmaoo OK so some of them seem interesting I don't really want to do any of the discover ____ ones tho cuz idk
wait wait	Half of them are courses I'm not interested in
ok listen fpops are not for the learning no one learns shit there	LOL culture shock again
they are for making friends and it might seem trivial or whatever but they are V important i didnt do one bc i had an internship but if i could have i would	Oh huh that's interesting
i was only ok bc i had my simons friends who introduced me to their fpop friends	Oh yeah u were busy before freshman summer During the summer *
because a lot of people form groups with their fpops and they remain friends all yr	Oh shat
and like making friends or whatever might seem easy but ITS NOT LOL	OK I'm scheduled to drive up with my parents on the 25th tho I'd have to go up early right
and u need friends to pset with or ur fucked	Oh shitttt
yes you would have to go up early	COME TO ME MY NEW FRIENDS
HAHA its k u got simons people	Okay I'm finna try to pick something on campus tho
yeah yeah do that plus they'll take u around boston to eat	There are some that cost money and away from campus and I don't know if I can do that Oh niceeee
so you'll get a sense of the city before which is real nice	WAIT GER THIS NEHA THE ONLY TWO PEOPLE THAT CHOSE MIT THIS YEAR AND ME AND MY ROOMMATE FROM LAST SUMMER AND WERE ROOMING TOGETHER AGAIN
OMG I STAN	EBERYONE ELSE FUCKING DIPPED TO HARVARD AND YALE
TRAITORS	Yale was so popular this year
its k theyre missing out	YEAH WHAT THE FUCK
rly wait i love this	Ok also half of them didn't apply either so I was like ??????
this is so cute dumb	Ikrrrrr Some of them want to cruise tho
i guess smh not hardcore enough	So like I know one of my friends just like Didn't even consider after she got in
its k u will leave mit like a war hardened veteran	AHA I HOPE SO I hope I leave in one piece Also I'm kind of studying for some ASEs rn do u have any recommendations for those Cuz like I've heard the success rate is p low for some of them
Yes Def do 6.0001	And I don't want to waste my time unless there are enough resources for them
Dont do chem	Yah I think i will I'm taking the edX for that rn
Chem is the worst one If youre good at bio do it	Oh wow so I should probably close this chem textbook in front of me then
Yeah	I'll try for bio yeah Is the class easy at mit tho
Wait straight up the main people who pass chem are chem olympiad	Intro chem
Well its pass fail So yes lol	Oh shit lmao yeah no the most I've done is compete at the regionals
There are 3 classes of chem	What if I just fuck around and don't take it until junior year as an easy credit or smth
3.091, 5.111, and 5.112	Oh huh
If you are premed/love chem a lot do 5.111 or 5.112 If you just want the cred do 3.091 But thats a later problem lol If youre good at physics and confident Do the 8.01 ASE Or if you got 5s on APs youre good lol I didnt take 8.01 and it was a litty time	BOU DONT MAKE ME NERVOUS e and m comes out in a month And I DONE FUCKED UP
Oh boy	I can't even explain to u
Nah youre fine	Like Please curve
It'll be chill Dw	I can't remember but like I hardcore FREAKED OUT during frq and wrote like gauss's law wrong So that was great
Its ok its ok Curve is v good	Aha I heard it's like 45% or 50% these days So like Clutch plz Yeah I'd rather not take physics again It's just So hard Did u take chem this year Cuz I have no interest into going anything chem related so
Im taking chem junior year	Any particular reason or just like Same reason as me
Planning on passing with a solid C	LOL Ok I got it
I have hard classes then so	Yeahhhhh wait no cap that's what my roommate is planning too
Its nice to offset with one I don't have to try that hard in Ah nice	She's 6-14 i think
Ohh gotcha	Yeah I gotchu That's smart I should've done that in hs lmao And it wasn't even that bad
Hahaha	I just like tried to kill myself senior year Like why did I take ap euro
oof	Lmaoo
Ok wait so summary: take the 6.0001 and bio ASEs And as much math ASEs as you are capable of But like also enjoy ur summer u know	Ohhh I see Good advice Tyty Also I'll do my best I'm like basically chilling these days Damn I realize u kind of went hardcore last summer Were u studying for ASEs while u had your internship?
Yeah	You Are a fighter A soldier A trooper 
Lol Wait nah I only took 2 ASEs tho So it wasnt too bad Im interning this summer in boston thoo So lmk when u get here!!! Im living in a FRAT HOUSE u can come be a frat boy w me	Oiiiiiiii That's WILD Lmao yes I will U have So much motivation how do  u do it Good luck this summer tho
LOL my manager came over sorry I have NO motivation I am sad and sleep all the time Its rough	LOL WAIT YOURE WORKING EIGHT NOW HOLY wait Go work Don't let me distract u Don't be sad Watch YouTube
Its k its lunch	Eat
Hahaha	Yeah keep sleeping that's food good wait um so i'm looking at the advising application right now and it says u can do esg with an advsing sem or esg with traditional advising and it says if i choose with an advising sem i should rank the sems in 2-5 but do the sems have to be with esg or are they all just part of first year advising sems and then the advising sem wouldn't be with just esg kids right
I'm not sure about this But I assume if you take a non ESG sem there would be non ESG kids	wait so if you're a part of esg the important thing is not that your advisor is in esg too right it's just that somme of your girs will be in smaller groups with other esg kids and you'll do other community stuff together right
yes wait your advisor should just be someone who you think can help you imo because after first sem advisors dont do all that much except are a resource for you	ohhhhhhh
so pick someone who would be a resource for you	i got it
mine rn is the PI of the lab I want to work in	oh shat well i feel like u have good things coming your way
lmao she thinks im dumb its k	lmfao what why
I was like can i get into grad school and she was like tf why are you asking me	LMFAO i mean isn't she your advisor
yeah but im a frosh LOL she was like...  this is not a right now problem	oh true but PLAN AHEAD
Hahahaha	3 years is a long time but it's also not a long time
I just had a rough second sem So I was v worried	oh shit ah well i mean school do be kinda rough tho
Yeah	but i think you'll be ok
Omg Ur so kind HAHA im dead Yeah its chill I had medical issues Hopefully will not be a prob this next semester	oh i see
It better not be cuz my courses are kill me otherwise!!!	yes stay healthy drink water do the health things
HydRaTe or DIeDraTe	LMAO
Thats one of our REX events	yeah
Im planning REX this yr for new house! V excited	Oiii that's lit sorry last question i swear so on the esg website it says that there are a few core subject offerings for fall 2019 and none of them are classes i need to take or want to take atm is there like a requirement if you're a part of esg that u have to participate in like a certain number of their core subject classes because i just planned myh schedule and i use none of the esg classes cuz it says this on the website and idk what it means Flexibility of schedule (at least 2 GIRs at ESG, but students can take other classes outside of ESG)
All that means is that you have to take 2 GIRs at ESG and everything else is up to you Take math at esg if you can theirs is better	Oh does it mean I have to take them both first sem
No Whenever	Oh whew Nice
Wait send the screenshot	Ok
Yeah whenever Im pretty sure I had a friend who only took the physics gir at esg first sem	Alright cool beans
heyhey hackmit apps are open im on the organizing team, you should def do it :))	Oh wait I was actually I just hadn't gotten around to it When do apps close again
we have rounds next round closes this sunday	Oh shat Is it a long app
no	Cuz freshmen are guaranteed in right
ur a frosh so you get auto acceptance hahah yeah its chill just write 2 sentences for everything	Yatee hey neha did u take the bio and cs ases last fall? i signed up for those this year and i basically did both edX courses this summer but i'm not sure if it's good enough
i took cs bio is apparently not that bad and taking the edx courses is def good enough	And Cs is just like basic Python syntax and logic right Okay whew because I'm worried I have to know like Biological processes in the cell and whatever I heard it's conceptual from some but not sure so Also Im gonna be at hackmit this fall So I'll look out for u
yea its pretty conceptual i had a lot of my friends who took it YES LOOK FOR ME ill be there at help desk	oh whew OK YES I WILL i don't really know anything though
oh its chill	so i'm just there to sit in and learn so like is that ok
its meant for beginners!!!	aight dope
we have lots of workshops and talks and mentors who will help u out	gud gud i just randomly ranked fintech as one becuase i have never tried it before but now i know nothing so
ya thats chill haha	okay cool
u can learn things !	:DD
HI WYAAA IM ON CAMPUS	ME TOO maseeh
Omg im at maseeh rn Can u meet me in the lobby in 15	Wait probably
yay ok I'm just hauling stuff around lol	Okay I'll be in the lobby
Oops Come to our hydrate or diedrate event!! At 2:45 New house	Lmaooo Aight I'll try
OMG U APPLIED FOR HACKMIT wait is that u LOL lmao it is u i see the reference to dr duong im head of cr on hack lol	Oh shat Yes I did apply for hack ;))) It is indeed a reference
wowow excited	Indeed Please accept me
hahaha i am unfortunately not at most recruitment events for hack bc im in london rn but will put in a good word	Holy shit London???? What r u doing there
lol this quantum computing conference ive been here for a week flying back tomorrow	Omg why r u so cool How has it been so far
rly good haha how is ur first week of classes	Low-key feel an impending doom but whatever
hahaha hey congrats for getting an interview	Aw shit I did????? Litt I did omg Yay that's exciting
Yayy	Yay indeed
JAMIE U ARE ON HACK EXCITING CONGRATS NOW U ARE STUCK W ME 5EVER	LOL YEAH I AM OH NO THIS IS TROUBLESOME lol no I'm jk I'm hype
BE HYPE UR COMING TO HACK AFTERPARTY	OKAY
also	THERES AN AFTERPARTY?
u are required to come to a workshop tomorrow LOL	Okay sure lol

 hi sign up for tasks on go/babies	oh hi there yeah i didn't put it on the main meeting notes oops i kind of just put it on the dev stuff i'll add it now
oh nw	there is much to do alas hey neha do u happen to have a folder with all of the updated logos for hackmit apis this year or do u know where i can get them
go/logos	Oh I see tyty
come to cr postmortem tomorrow!!	Wait what's going on tmrw????
a cr meeting thats actually a party roll through at 9:30/10 pm for a good time its at theta xi	Lmaoooo is that far
uh its across the river HOWEVER basically all of hack will be there and some litty alum so roll through for a good time and team bonding!!	Damnnnn so r there gonna be vans there or do I need to uber me a ride there if I go
walk?	Oh wait I have no idea where it is lmao Yeah that works too lol
Wyaaaa Do u want an address	Oh shit wait I can't go tonight :/h hey neha do u have any time over iap to do some startlabs stuff or like have u heard back from any of your contacts yet Hey are there specific on boarding documents for new sponsors for hack
we have a packet for sponsors for hack but its mostly for the event and day of logistics	Oh hmm So is it just an invoice then For the money stuff
yea	Okay cool nehaa can u fill out this for startlabs:  also does shobhi have a fb
yes she does Shobhita sundaram Will fill out rn!	Tytyyy Hey neha r u coming to finance today
You can now call each other and see information like Active Status and when you've read messages. That would work. Give it a good try meanwhile	ok thanks so much praneeth i'll let you know if i run into anything! hi praneeth i am trying to implement a split network for a resnet-18 right now and the last layer is a linear transformation to the 10 classes for mnist the models are listed in nn.sequential containers but i want to flatten the output before i apply the last linear layer i think with pysyft all the tensors turn into pointer tensors when you run the model on it so i try to extract the data from the pointer tensor and apply the flattening before doing linear but i get this error: RuntimeError: shape '[0, -1]' is invalid for input of size 524288 and right before i apply this the shape of the output tensor is like shape torch.Size([64, 512, 1, 1])
ah countinue to think about it.. am not sure I can think. of a fix rightaway there is a more engineering inclined MS student, Abhishek Singh in our group that can help you with this-but your first have to keep trying and chiseling at it meanwhile. you*	ok sure i'll keep trying later tonight thank yo! you*! Hi Praneeth, given MIT's newest announcement, do you know if we can move our meeting from this Friday to a remote one some other time next week? I am rushing to make travel and storage arrangements atm. I'm so sorry for the inconvenience, and please stay safe. Thank you so much
Absolutely. Let us do remote mtngs Stay safe during and after the travel	thanks so much, that sounds great
We can find a time over email once you settle	that would be amazing yeah, i am still very invested in working on this urop throughout the rest of the semester and potentially this summer?
summer could certainly be an option, if you do satisfactorily..	sounds great, i've just texted abhishek over slack to see if we can re set up a meeting i wasn't able to meet with him last week due to my immediate moving out, but hopefully i can get some things set up with him i also asked him if he is still planning on doing a remote onboarding session, but as its been pretty chaotic for all of us i can understand if he's waiting a little bit
so abhishek got super busy with a covid19 project our group is doing..	oh got it i see maybe i can find another resource who can help answer my questions but it's not a major concern obviously you guys must have a lot on your plate rn
Yeah.. thanks Any progress with that dataset?	hi praneeth, sorry for the late response, i actually am getting 403 errors forbidden on the dataset, meaning i don'[t have permission to access them it seems i have been working on running a colab instance of the resnet it's running on the gpu offered by colab but still taking some time i won't be able to tmux the session tho as far as i know and i'm not sure if i'd be able to exit the browser tab and still have the computation run there is a pretty nice densenet implementation built by pytorch - is there a specific place you want me to split it at and between how many workers?
Split it restively early say after 3 or 4 layers Start with 2 workers and then movr to 5	okay thanks! how should i get the data shared w me
Let me see if i can open it. If not we move to another data i can send	ok thanks!
can you access this folder btw? 	oh sorry ignore the second scrren i forgot i had extended it ^ here is the relevant screenshot it says additional permissions required and that i should ask the project or bucket owner to grant
Ah got it. can you try on chexpert dataset instead  also what is your gmail id?	yes, i will try on that gmail is jamie.fu@gmail.com
cool am working with po-chih kuo to get you access to that other dataset on google clous meanwhile. did you get a chance to complete citi training? Plan: CheXpert data will help you do some practice once you can run with it. Let me know where you are on it? Like, for ex: able to download and load that data?	that's great, no i haven't done the citi training yet oops should i get that done before i touch the data?
well..its ideal if you can do it (but its also a time sink haha)	is the dataset very large? I have downloaded the zip but don't want to open it on my local so i was planning on getting that onto the matlaber machines i've been going back and forth with necsys for the past few days and finally got access to matlaber and the docker machines
oh thats big. excellent	i still have problems with jupyter notebook, but i don't need it to do my work for now
are you able to ssh into them till the terminal	i ran the resnet on matlaber as well yes
ok	i can ssh into them
good see if you can train with splitNN on chexpert.	ok yep i'll give that a shot next when should i have the citi stuff done and should i prioritize that first lol
ok, plan: 1.) train with splitNN on chexpert. 2.) then you can do citi. 3.) meanwhile i will get the other google cloud data into an accesible form for you, once you are done with citi, you can run on that. 4.) finishing 3 will certainly give you paper!	ok awesome thanks praneeth!
citi needed for the data in 3.) not before ok cool any updates on 1.?	yeah, so i have all the architecture built for the densenet already and now i'm just wrangling the chexpert data to try to make a custom dataset with pytorch that will allow it be fed into the nn i also looked at the citi training link you sent me but it redirects me to a 404
ok just focus on finishing the chexpert results for now end to end!	OK sure thing!
lets have a update call scheduled for mon or tue?	does 1pm on tues work for you?
Yes. Ok putting it on my cal also try to put the code with comments on github internal. not public and share link	OK sure should i make the zoom link?
yes!	
If any initial issue with having the dataset loaded on your side, reach out to Po-Chih early on. He is very helpful. Will save time.	ok got it thanks!
Were you able to get hold of that dataset (tfrecord to pytorch) or stuck?	yes, po-chih was able to help give me access i took a quick look and i think i can process the tfrecords in pytorch i've been cramming for finals lately since that's in a week and a half but i'll have a lot more time to process the data as soon as they're done
ok what is your finals timeline like-done by? Then do give it a try if it still has the security issue in letting you read those files.	i'll be done by next thursday the 21st! got it, i'll let you know asap if it doesn't let me read
great can you share info on how you are using the labs computing infra? Another urop of mine needs this info as google colab keeps timing out	yeah absolutely also the tfrecord data looks good on early glances i had a bunch of meetings today and have some more tmrw but i'll have more time to look at it soon
fantastic! keep me posted	let me grab the links i used to get in touch with matlaber
yeah post here and will share with her	actually i've been meaning to write up a guide for the matlaber machines since there are some stuff that isn't up to date anymore i will take some time to do this tn so the links i have are all together and can be used for future use hi praneeth, i just finished up the matlaber guide here
Fantastic! This is of great use Thanks	i decided to use an html file with markdeep because it does code rendering yeah absolutely
no worries. looks clean!	hi praneeth do u know what the image dimensions are for the mimic data that po-chih sent me i'm doing preprocessing on all the data rn and all the scans are stored as jpg bytes
best thing just email him on that thread and have me cc'd .	ok sure will do hey praneeth i've written all the code necessary to run densenet on mimic-cxr datasets early test runs aren't showing very good results though i ran it on all the lateral data last night but only for a couple of epochs it gave like just less than 50% accuracy though but you can easily get something much higher just by predicting all zeroes because the majority of labels are just 0 i'm kind of stuck here for what to do next - i've tried a couple different learning rates and optimizers as well i have all the code i've written on a github repo though so the architecture is all there oh also i caught a bug with pysyft that throws a bunch of exceptions on shutdown which is really annoying. it tries to delete all of its object and pointer tensors concurrently with python shutdown and this causes a bunch of exceptions to be put on the console. i looked it up and it's actually an issue that just got opened up recently so as of now there's no easy solution anyways if you share your github username with me i can add you to the private repo so you have access to all my code
i) try some more tuning if any and share with Po-Chih and ask. ii) ask him what architecture they used and if any modifications were made, iii) ask them their accuracy numbers iv) do mention this is the first pass of your model/code in the beginning of email. its vepakom on github.mit.edu if you make some screen shots of issue and write a para describing it, I have a direct contact to folk at openmined/pysyft (adam hall) that created those tutorials in first place along with co-founder andrew trask. Will connect to them to have them resolve it sooner. good pace of work. keep it up!	are we allowed to share across domains? my repo is just on the general github domain okay i'll take some screenshots when i run into it again
Yeah i do lol do u?	yeah i saw u in the club tennis slack
ooh nice yeah i played in high school	aw dope that's awesome i'll see u wednesday at practice then
yup cya there!! Hello r u up	Hi Just a little I'm literally about to sleep
Lol i am in the maseeh 6 lounge rn Hey are u gonna do the maseeh apple picking thing	Most likely not
ok nvm i thinks its full anyway lol	:pp
R u going to prax today	Nah I have start labs Fat L considering this will be the third time in a row I'm not going Probably for an hour on Friday tho I'm gone for the weekend tho
lol bruhh i realized i cant go fridays and i have stuff more than half of the saturdays so i might have to drop :(	:0000 yeah that sucks fat L
wait now that its sundays and fridays when u gonna go	Wait did u see the updated slack Its still three days I thought Some outdoor some indoor
wait thats only for a few weeks tho once it acc gets cold its only gonna be sun and fri	Oh hmm I think I can do both days
ok ill be going on sundays!!	Ayeee There's sectionals this weekend tho So no practice for a bit
o true lol i gave my racket to someone to string and idk where it is now i needa find it 	Lmao were u strings even broken
yeah lol i have 1 more racket but im not tryna lose my other one rip	Oh hmm aight have u asked neeraj
lol its ok ill figure it out at the next prax	:D ryan kim serious question how is 6.046 how much of a time consumer is it and how much am i going to die in the class and like just assume i'm going to be like 2-5x less capable than you but this is also depending on when i take it so
hey lol uh so i think 046 is pretty mathematically involved the psets and tests are both pretty challenging and to do well on them you prob have to spend a lot of time on them that being said, i've heard you don't have to do that well on tests to get an A in the end	Is it curved or smth
and i think if you work with people and get hints on the pset problems its doable yeah the average on the first quiz was like 43/120	Shit lol
but i think if you get like 60/120 you'll get an A or maybe even like 50 if you do all the psets i'm not sure tho	Oh man Ok
wait i might be wrong thats just what i heard but yeah are u in 006 rn	Wait r u not in 046 rn
i am	Oh Ok
but idk what the actual grade cutoffs are	Wait no 8m not in 006 I was going to take that next semester
oh ok	I just wanted to ask about 046
yeah makes sense prax today?	6.009 qui
o rip	Yeah it really do be
lol gl!!	Do u Allen and whoever else want to split a tophat account for the 9.00 textbook
wait r u in it rip um i'm prob not gonna take the class lol ill lyk if i end up takin it tho	yeah boo lmao what hass r u going to take instead wb allen
i think he's taking it lol im alr in 14.03	oh what ok fair
haha yeah how was 036	it was aight did u not go oh no u were there weren't u i got lost when he got into the theta lin alg shit i haven't really taken lin alg before either sooo
lmao ok wait i went for a little	and then u gave up?
no i went at the end i have a class at the same time lmao	omfg ok yeah what did i expect
oops haha	Lol I'm sure you've got it under control
wait whatt ur uroping in camera culture too??	ahah wait that's your urop too? i just started it and haven't really done anything
yeahh oh dang	plus i'm really confused about pysyft
hmm yeah research is very hard	so i was supposed to like learn a lot from abhishek last week but then i had to cancel my meeting w him
i haven't touched my project since last tues when the world started ending haha	so life was chaos LoL yeah
wait abhishek is so nice	oh wait really? idk praneeth is my mentor but abhishek was supposed to help me out yeah i'm hoping he will accept my incompetentness
haha ok my mentor has been very nice even tho i'm clueless his name's subhash have u figure out summer planz yet	NOPE i have no idea what i'm doing
rip	haha i doubt you're clueless
wait r u considering continuing ur urop	wbu
bc i am but i have no idea besides possibly that lol	hmmm yeah maybe i kind of want to do some nlp research this summer if i'm going to keep doing research
oo is that what ur interested in thats cool	yeah but i have zero exp in it
haha ok	so the labs in csail don't really want me yet
whats ur cam culture project in	um it's really vague but it's supposed to be like implementing some split learning methodologies in some use cases and seeing how too improve communication efficiency with the methodology and addressing nonhomogeneity in data
hm ok seems like there would be cool directions to go with that	possibly seems very proof of concepty but i also want to actually learn pytorch at some point
nice yeah i had to learn it for mine too haha	ye it's actually not too bad but i don't understand the structure so well so copying templates is fine but idk if i'm going to need to be able to build my own at some poitn
lol ye i think urops are good for building this like real-world knowledge /real-world skills	Moderately I guess It's all research but It can be
hello jamie have u read the 036 notes for NN 2	Hello ryan I just finished watching the lec So yes Sort of
Wait i just wanted to clarify somethin for momentum, if we set gamma = 0.9, that mean's we're taking 0.9 of the previous moving average and 0.1 of the current gradient, right? so the current gradient has pretty low weight idk that 0.9 number just seemed kinda high to me	Aren't u calculating the current gradient using the previous gradients I'm also Not sure
ok i think you factor the current gradient into a moving average	Lmao I'm about to go to sleep but I'll look more tmrw morning since it'll probably be on the lab
haha aight dang u are going to sleep and i'm on the east coast and still havent slept rip gn	Lmao me too bro Michigan is edt I have lab at 930 So
haha rip shoulda switched lab sections 	Thought it was motivation to wake up in the morning But I'm just dying
haha yeah u should take a nap!	Lmao that is what I ended up doing
hey did u do 036 hw 10 yet	what a coincidence i usually never work on it this early but yeah i'm on 4 rn it's a fucking shitshow it's absolutely ridiculous
lmao im really confused on 3 and theres no test cases or anything to tell me why im wrong	u just need to check for each action whether or not in your data there are actually samples for that particular action and then if there are call fit and if there aren't don't call fit
oh hm ok lemme try that also for 4 can we do it in colab? or do we have to download the code file	u can do it in the colab i was having kind of a sucky time bc 3 doesn't catch all the formatting errors when nnq uses the q learning methods
oh hm ok	yeah
wait if we're using the colab the lab says we needa modify the definitions in mdp10.py wheres that file lol	Wait there's no file It's just The above code U have to run the reload cell To re compile it
hmm i get this which says it's not implemented in mdp10.py, even though i did implement it higher up i figured it out lol nvm	Oh great what was the problem
7.012,18.06,6.042,24.02 why	Lol we're only in 042 together what kerberos and id#
Saakethv and 921422503 Oh man am I getting added as a guest	Yes sir

I see Was there stuff around to make it a tourist place	Yeah It's a national park So they had a visitor center and whatnot
Ya at least thats more interesting than my break I went to a football game the other day	And?
It’s actually not too bad Once I learned the basic rules i guess I can see how people find it exciting	Concussions all around
Ya it’s a weird sport I just went bc my dads friend works with the dolphins so our friend group could get free tickets	Boiii That's cool
Ya def a different experience than watching on tv, but tvs easier so whatever	I've been to like One football game My entire life And I didn't get it
Same But they do the same thing for like the whole game so it wasn’t that hard to learn	When I went I was too short to even see
It’s ok you don’t need to go to another one	Yeah thank God we don't have a football team otherwise I might actually feel obligated to go

Ya it’s a really good show, brings back a lot of nostalgia from childhood Lmao that’s what online shoppings for, but we were in a mall so I walked around and looked at stuff	Its too late for me tho I feel like No u have to try on clothes and stuff
Nooo you should try it, it’s still a good show even if you’re not a kid I’m kinda terrible at clothes shopping that’s why my outfits are always just randomly put together tshirts and joggers	No like Isn't it very long And won't I get too invested Wait Same My mom defines my fashion for me And lole Like She's good But I shouldn't just rely on her lmao
My sense of long is kinda skewed since I binged long shows throughout high school But it isn’t that bad, 3 seasons and episodes are 20 mins Ya my parents are terrible at any fashion sense	HOW SIR Oh each episode is short
My childhood haircuts were terrible and I always got oversized clothes Idk I watched all 21 seasons of South Park during sat/act season And I watched game of thrones in like a week but that was the end of senior year	Beuh Bruh OK you're crazy Don't u want like human interaction in the middle of watching these things tho
Lol I went to school so I guess that counts If you mean talk about the show I didn’t do that to avoid spoilers	I mean like Sometimes in the middle of binge watching a show I'll just there and be like Damn I didn't talk to ANHBODY tosah And then I feel lonely Lmao
Rip I guess I got used to that I guess if I take a day off of social interaction I don’t really care	Huh Different lifestyle for different people ig

Thanks I try my best	Lol Alright I need to go to sleep now Waking up sort of early tmrw Gngn
Same gn Clothes shopping What a concept	Indeed Can't do it

Actually not much Might watch another movie The thing about today is will there be las at this time for checkoff	RN?
Ya	So u want to do it today?
But can we get a checkoff	It's all virtual anywaus
Ok fine let’s do it today	I have to go to dinner now How about after dinner
Sure	
Are you still leaving Sunday	Was originally supposed to leave say Sat But left this morning I'm home now
Dang I’m leaving tomorrow	Ik Tis sad what are some memorable moments we had this year have u done the 036 lab yet do u want to schedule sometime to do it
No Wanna do it now lol Actually nvm let’s do it tomorrow at like 11	lmao nice ok great 11am works for me Yo I just woke up can u five ma another hour real quick
Bruh	Oh shit sorry I barely even remember texting this I actually went to bed so late last time Soergyyyyyyy
Fine let’s just do it in the afternoon cuz I have to eat lunch soon	Okkk sorryyyyyu
Is now good	Yes
Ok how does this calling thing work	uhhhh do u want to use messenger or do u prefer like skype or zoom lol
lol zoom uh messenger is probably easiest	isolation_5174 The video chat ended.
wow childish gambino actually released a new album	Is it the same one that got taken off his website
I think so But the website didn’t have the full album	Have u listened to it yet Is it any good
Only first few songs It’s weird, but I guess he’s going for some unique thing I think later songs are more his normal style	Oh huh I'll take a listen in abit want to get a checkoff tmrw? There's going to be TAs online from 12-6pm
Ya sure	dope i'll let u know when I wake up lol but i'll definitely be awake by 230 or 3pm which is a low bar ik but just in case do u want to get a checkoff now
Sure	ok we're in position 4 for checkoff do u know how this thing even works
No Prob just some vid call or smth	ok great lmao just make sure u have zoom open i just sent u a zoom invite
Wait where	on zoom like a contact invite saakethv right
Ya Wait so will we be doing this from 9:30-11 in the future	Potentially yes Carmen Chan wants to join our lab group for 036 What say u
Who dat	Some girl I met at a tech talk then realized we were both from michigan But that's it
Sure Wait can lab groups be greater than 2	Now they can be 3
Ok	want to help out a friend on 3d on 036 exercises
You can just share them and we can look through together I expect these results to be pretty crude Like there are definitely flaws in the methodology of this process	haha alright yeah jianna and i talked for a bit about this and i think she texted u recently ok sure i can do some more test runs between years
Haha yes I got her semi rant /agree with her	LOL like yeah
I’ve been complaint about this to my boyfriend every day lol	LOL aww
I’m glad I’ve found someone else To complain to	i think that like the result oriented presentations every day make it difficult to spend time planning and making real progress
100% agree I’ve been contemplating emailing egomaniac Him Omg What kind of typo was that	so i've been trying to spend some time on my own to sort out what i want to do and stuff LOLLLLLL HOLY i almost died
Ya ive also created an outline of like high level goals. I really dislike having to give updates every 24 hours It’s a waste of time	eek yeah let's have an offline meeting about this with whoever else on project w is interested in this i'm also talking to Arun about some things we can plan for C
Haha sure I was curious what other people felt about how the project is going	lol ok great i'll spend some time tn running some word ratio code tho
So it’s nice to hear you/jianna	right haha me too
The word ratio is cool in super specific instances where it works really well But in general it’s a pretty basic technique	yeah i've been finding all the results really interesting so far but synthesizing it is another beast
Understandable It for sure does not need to be perfect, I just want some slides to show Max, then I’m going to have a meeting with him next week	LOL ir ikr
	"it really do be like that hey sam is all this data from the NEWS directory from max's web scraping? i noticed that we don't have labels for any of our data except for the nyt corpus correct me if i'm wrong? or i'm seeing this like ""keyword"" list being generated on the news directory what does this mean"
what keyword list the only labels are on NYT thats correct also it is 10:47 EDT woman is this a working hour??	[trying, warm, ...] LOL sorry my hours are so wack right now
ok the ML Keyword thing	i just do work whenever i feel lik eit
fascinating Anyway ya I'm not sure what those are	"LOL nice the nyt corpus data is so ridiculous to look at imo tho like ""LEAD:*3*** COMPANY REPORTS ***3*MARSH & MCLENNAN INC (NYSE)Qtr to Dec 3119861985Revenue444,700,000361,700,000Net inc49,300,00036,700,000Share earns.67.50Yr rev1,804,100,0001,367,600 000Net inc243,200,000162,900 000Share earns3.302.23*3*** COMPANY REPORTS ***3*MARSH & MCLENNAN INC (NYSE)Qtr to Dec 3119861985Revenue444,700,000361,700,000Net inc49,300,00036,700,000Share earns.67.50Yr rev1,804,100,0001,367,600 000Net inc243,200,000162,900 000Share earns3.302.23"" this is the entirety of the first entry in the corpus like what does this even mean tf no wonder the classifier is so shit"
ya that's pretty poorly formatted	LOL idk what to do also what to u think about crowdsourcing word bias
Ya its something I want to do	sorry this is not working hours but i just thought about it
haha no its fine I was mainly teasing	and i think it would make more sense for us to ask mturk users to rate these words as extreme/opinionated vs mild/objective for more obscure things i think liek coronavirus is p self-explanatory tho so that's like a good starting point
Ya ya I agree	maybe this is getting too much into project O
"I was thinking they could order synonyms from neutral to ""extreme"" so like illegal alien, undocumented immigrant, etc."	ohhhh that's interesting looks like mindy might be venturing into the same space as khaled maybe we should start working with her to synthesize some of this
Ya I think we should really combine the two projects	i'm starting to get muddled with the project definitions now haha
Ya I think Project W/T/O are extremely similar	oofoofofof i have something from 2-4 tomorrow i just saw u scheduled the meeting for 3 tho but i'll text you afterwards?
Wait what meeting	tomorrow's TWO meeting
Oh ok	yah i'll make sure i'm caught up tmrw afte ri get back sam we have matplotlib on euler right i saw u imported it for word ratios stuff but i literally cannot find the installation
ya im pretty sure its tehre matplotlib.pyplot	lol wait are u still in the conda environment cuz i think it accidentally got deleted like very recently
And he new one has no restrictions	Wait mine doesn't say that
Hmmm Did you get one after you turned 17?	Yeah
Ohhh ok so that’s prob why Bc those restrictions are technically over if you’re seventeen and have had your license for over 6 months For me, bc I was already 17 when I got my license, I had to wait till I was 18/ had it for 6 months to get rid of the restrictions	Ohhhhhhhh Thanks I get it now

ikr!! I’m legit wearing it everywhere I go omg like I’m wearing it in Kroger rn	Omfg you're gonna make some other kpop friends in public now
Bet!! That would be so cool actually like I also just really like it bc it’s simple? Like just a plain black cap almost my other hats are all snapbacks and also p colorful so I don’t really wear them anywhere	the white rim is really interesting i think it adds some volume to the hat probably not my style cuz i'm always tryna make my head look smaller but whatever works
Yeaaa I like the rim!! And LOL your head’s not even that big tho? Also haha now all I need to complete my outfit is a black face mask thingy (idk what they’re called lmao)	Yeah face masks lmaooo Alrigjt I'm making u a video rn But It really long

ooooh huh	All Chinese movies get put up on YouTube eventually tho

ok lmk when it’s put up!!	It seems good at least
okii	Also I just like the actor
Lolll okok	If he doesn't act well in this movie I'm finna be upset He's in this group called tfboys tho And I personally think he's the best actor out of the 3 All 3 of them do acting gigs I think But this guy I like the most
wait shoot what this trailer was so sad It makes me wanna cry Also really good tho!!! oooh he’s good looking!!	i know it's sad as shit tho it's about the chinese gaokao and like
bruh yea if even the trailer can make me almost cry.....	bullying i guess
yeaaa	chinese gaokao is college entrance exam
wait what exactly is gaokao	and it's for 2 whole days apparently
ohhh ok Damn!!!	and all chinese students get into college based on it
that’s p insane	and it's intense is there something like that in india?

ik entrance exams are crazy	sacred almost
ahhh okay	also this video is still rendering and my fan is going crazy rn my laptop is so hot lmao
wait what exactly does rendering mean	idk i downloaded this fancy video editing software and it's just like compiling all my edits into an mp4 format basically so it can save cuz you make video edits on their software then it needs to transfer those edits to actual video results
ooooh sounds cool!!! Loll you know smth I actually wanna learn how to do stage lighting stuff my dance teachers daughter does some and we were talking bout it bc I have stage rehearsal tomorrow and the diff effects you can do are actually so cool!!	oh that does sound interesting i want to get good at video editing or like photoshop or smth i think that'd be cool

okiii	feel free to watch it tmrw

Hi hi so can you like cut it down to make a 5 min version of the video? depending on the how early/late our program is running we’ll decide which to play!

oooh ok Wahhhh I just saw your video!!! That was so cuteee And also funny And sweet ahhhh I love you I’m def playing the whole thing!!!	OMG LOL glad u like it
just as mp4 file tho sorry, I love your subs!! But someone else will have to be playing the video so my dad says it’s easiest yeees!! I love that you brought up dongha too omg And all our random escapades	LOL yeah no worries

loll I love crashing your house tho!! but ok ^ also Amy wanted to know if you wanted to hang out when we get back too!	Sure as long as close by?
Okii	My parents would definitely not let u in tho lmaoo our house is soooo gross
Boiii you always say that but your house is literally always fine we can be in my house if you want I’m pretty sure tho	No it ain't Whatever y want As long as it's close And the money I have to spend is minimal
Lmaooo why, you earning money kid!!	Not that much man
called you.	Free to go to donghas at 230 today for like half an hour? Just have disseminate items can't stay long
I’m actually still in canton area, idt I could make it back by 2:30 wb later?	Oh shoot wait yeah I think we talked about this yesterday Yeah I'm just trying to leave the house for a little bit before my parents get home cuz my mom was upset at me yesterday lmfao Maybe tmrw then
Ahhh ok Yea maybe tomorrow? omg dude my parents just got soooo upset at me bc Jessica and I wanted to go to the briarwood mall and we started driving there It’s in like Ann Arbor And they both Called and just freaked on me and literally screamed so loud ughhhh so now we’re in a random thrift store in canton instead	Lmfao cux they don't want u to go far?
but yea no they’re actually gonna be so mad when I get home	Sure tmrw
Yeaaa my mom was like “NOOO” You’d think I was being kidnapped or smth omg	Smh saranya Not a good daughter
omg no I am I’m the best daughter	R u going to buy smth for Zoe tmrw morning
I actually wasn’t sure what to get her/if I should get her smth But someone actually came by to our house to say w a fresh tiramisu cake they made	Should we get her ssmth joint gift tmrw
And since it’s p large and I don’t wanna eat it by myself imma bring it	College decor or makeup? Oi nice
hmm I’m down for that but I’m actually going to xc practice in the morning	That's what I'm thinking
It’s at 8 tho; what time were you thinking of going	Smh don't be athletic
we could go right before??	Right before 8??? Damn u crazy???
LMAO I think they’re having a water ballon fight so not athletic Omg no j mean right before Zoe’s	I was finna get up at 9 earliest
So like 11?	One hour ain't enough tho
10:30?? Idk if I can come before then Also wait let’s do college decor bc I know nothing abt makeup	Okay just text me when practice is over
Target run?? I have a bunch of gift cards okii	We can either go together or if I'm already at the mall or smth U can meet me there
Ohh okok	Target works too Idrk where to get college decor
target should be cheaper Idk where in the mall What kind of decor you thinking?	Bro idk shit man
also kohl’s/meijer might have cute cheap stuff, so we can get a couple of things Instead of like one or two larger things	Omg that's so much running around to do I feel like there should be a centerpiece tho ya feel
yeaaa	That way it doesn't feel too Like Thrown together
Wait the cake thing should be refrigerated so I don’t wanna leave it in my car for too long Yeaa we should pick a theme	Oh yeah We can always stop by your house right before?
Wait omg!! What if we go w a cork board decor idea? So like smth to put in on, different cloths to decorate it, pins and stuff too? And we can print out some pictures too? idk if it would work but random thought! And we could do other wall decor stuff	How would we make time for that tho Also
Oh yea Michaels will have cute things too	Keep in mind That Zoe likes room decor But She's really messy So like something that would be like Take up a lot of space And require a lot of care on the regular I mean that's hard in college already I'm not too sure tho You know what youre the lead on this
Hmmm Omg no idk anything Ok this is for a guys room but kinda what I was thinking?	Oh I see What would we pin on it tho
like to get her all the supplies for this and she could put it together and just put it up on a wall or smth? Idk if thats possible tho what dyou think	The obhhh That could work yeah But Wed be giving her work to do LMAO which she honestly might like Where should we look for this What about something like this
oooh that’s also pretty!! And hmm yea I’m not sure where you’d get a cork board? Or this metal frame but either could workB *!	Also I usually have a lot of success with like the makeup or skincare packages I usually don't individual things But some of the sets are really nice
huh idt ive ever bought those? where dyou get that	Jcpenny and macys P nice can show u tmrw
oooh okok	Does umich need a fan or ac
Yea tbh that would be a lot easier of a gift to get fan	Probably not right it's too cold for that
She might have one already tho?	Oh yeah that too
ok so should we just decide what we’re getting tomorrow? Based on how much time we have and what kind of stuff we can find?	Sure
Hey I’m actually coming back now!! what time dyou wanna go I just have to take a shower	Omg I just woke up Do u want to go at 10
Sure! should b ready by then Dyou wanna drive me	Smh fine
We can come back later to pick up the cake !!	Okk I think it's more likely I'll be at your house around 1015

like he revealed peter Parker!! how could he	What was the last one tho
And accused him of things	Lmao you're so attached to this man omg
oh apparently nick fury was in like space the whole time? And the person you thought was nick fury the whole time was a skrull (the things from captain marvel) impersonating him, but like nick fury knew it? And they were in touch?? it didn’t really make sense to me tbh	Oh yeah yeah I remember now

yea but tis more fun w friendsss	No I meant The mug mix Not the with friends part
Ohhhh yea but like I normally only have cinnamon at home And I wanted chocolate mug cake so I initially went to go buy cocoa powder, and then I found this mug cake mix!! Like it comes w frosting too so	Lollll omfg So extra Yes I'll eat mug cake w u tmrw
yeeep that’s me! We love being extra I did buy the cocoa powder too ya know!	Lol whaddya need coca powder for
for making chocolate things! Like I can mix it w pancake mix to make them chocolatey And we also have pastry sheets so maybe I can make chocolate rolls or smth? Basically for any baking	cocoa powder must be so unhealthy tho
haha yea probably	good food is good food tho i don't like chocolate as much as you either so maybe that's why i don't get it
yeaaa omg it’s so bad, basically all the food I like is super unhealthy but yea I am a lil too addicted to chocolate	how have u never gotten tired of it crazy wil d
 Yea no like I could prob eat double the amt of just pure chocolate and not feel sick Which is bad! Bc then I have no limit or control!	do u like never feel sick after u eat a lot won't that prevent u next time
For general food yes, I do? Not exactly sick, more just like overly full and gross but for dessert stuff, almost never	whatttt wild
Nono it’s badddd	Yeah but you're fine so far so Hy stop
mehhh Wait you tutoring rn?	Lol yeah Mondays and tuesdays

Oh well we streamed it instead Ahhh it was so good but also so sad	Lol I didn't like civil war
oh yea wait you don’t really like the captain America movies right	I don't dislike any of them actually I just don't agree with captain America sometimes
^^yeaaaa I feel Like ughhh all the accords talk did annoy me I just want them all to be a family! But no they just gotta fight	He's so like idealistic and perfectly moral and it irritates me because I am full of hatred
LOL you’re not full of hatred! but yea def he’s very idealistic	I'm definitely full of hatred I'm just so easily annoyed by a fictional character smh
idk like bc I’m also kinda like that I think I relate a little more? But I also love tony stark and hate that everyone basically left him lmaooo dw me tooo I actually really like Bucky Barnes, even tho we don’t really get to know him much Also I just find that actor and his hair and everything super hot so	OMFG that was the ulterior motive Man our taste is just so differeng Also I feel bad for Bucky to an extent But like Captain america isn't the man's babysitter Ya feel He's always there to cushion him and protect him from the truth
Yeaaa like cap is way to protective of him? Like he sorta left the rest of his friends to go after bucky	Yeah ikrrrr
but Bucky can take care of himself!	And how is thay Perfectly moral Oh right if isn't god I hate perfect people
yeaaa no his morals def aren’t right	FULL OF HAFRED I TELL U
But like, his heart is in the right place still? ok jamiee	Yeah I mean I dont think he's ever done something he thinks is wrong
Yeaaa and I do admire that, like he’s sticking up for what he believes is right at least? Rather than being all wishy-washy or trying to do what someone else wants of him wait I just realized the absence of nick fury in this film like where’d he go	Oh yeah idk Couldn't afford him ig
LMAO oooh also other notable characters I really love (basically all of them whoops): Peter Parker! Black panther! Natasha! Wanda! Vision!	Thats Everybody
Arghh ik I did say that	The I thought the Wanda vision romance was cheesy and cringe a little bit
like I just think they’re all super cool	Good hearted sure but
ehhh yea a big *bit	Not enough time to be developed
I think there was a lil bit at end of ultron tho?	Yeah I can't remember
Like he saved her or smth? When she didn’t trust him bc he reminded her of ultron	Also no idea why I just don't vibe with Natasha Romanoff Oh huh Yeah mshbe
Oh huh	I think it's cuz she's so serious all the time And cool
I didn’t in the first avengers, I think I really liked her after winter soldier tho and in endgame	I don't remember winter soldier at all
ehhh yea I can see that She’s like p witty omg her and Steve have all these moments in winter soldier	Omg lol
it’s actually just like, a really good and relevant movie tho, like it super ties in w mcu and shield and hydra	Yeah Im relying on like vague context fro. The other movies to remember Hydra again lol
ahhh yea, I feel like it’s mainly talked abt only in cap’s movies, but it’s like linked w nick fury and stuff too so	Yeah it's a whole ass plot detail
Yee	U should sleep right I need to sleep in a bit Work tmrw

ok yea we’ll if you do it that way, then I guess I get up at like 8smth every day? And then sleep for another 2-3 hrs?

Oh okok You should do it w someone!! But yea v v creepy also what dyou think of this painting	Oh dude did u do that? That's awesome
LOL sort of I did half (The worse half lmao)	I heard bandersnatch wasn't like the best one tho like there were technical problems with it Wait how So I just wanna watch other good black mirror episodes
Yeaaa it was kinda annoying, like it was like we were supposed to have the choices but it felt like the show was forcing us to pick certain things and Suzie and I painted it together!	Aha ikr
aka I attempted to paint and she fixed my side	Oh wait y'all met up? That's dope
it was just us two but yea! Twas fun	That's so cool At her place or yours
Omg I showed it to my mom and she was like let’s take painting classes! Hers I just came back haha	Oh man you're running around everywhere lmaoo Aye cool
Yeaaa tbh But idk when I’ll see her again since she’s legit moving out to Cali so like her mom is moving there too?	Like Forever? Damn
and her dad’s moving to China yeaaa so like	DAMN Like he's moving to work?
I think he already moved actually? And he came back now to visit but he’s going back I think??? Tbh not entirely sure	Oh what  make yourself on picrewwwwww fun thing i saw on tumblr the other day
oooh is this like a character design thing?? I’ll try it out on my latop!! Also totally random thing but ohmygod I am traumatized; I was going through stuff in my drive and I found a half-finished markhyuck angst fic I was writing why am I like this omg	LMAO WOW Get a tumblr and post it Yeah try it My face is fatter tho I made a different one later which is more accurate But Didn't save
oooh I like that!!! Especially the outfit omg Also the eyes tho	Lol they're not right
and LOL it’s such a cliche fic tho I think I got inspired by like a three second clip from a video Ehhh still look nice! also the fic is incomplete so welp	You could finish it lol
my drive is literally filled with incomplete works lmao I guess that’s both depressing and hopefully *hopeful?	Yes it is indeed Make your voice known to the world It'll be liberation g Liberating
mmm true, I never have posted anything omg I just remembered your fic!! I actually really liked that ahhh	ahaha i haven't been writing anything recently though maybe if you give me a prompt i could write something i read a lot of fics these days too instead* not too also i've recently been going back and resuming my watching of idol producer 2 which is like china produce 101
omg yes!!! What kinda prompt? Or should I just give anything? And maybe you can give me a prompt too! Also yeaaa me too, tho I’ve kinda always read significantly more than I’ve written so and ahhh I remember being obsessed w season 1 around this time last year!!	Oh sure that'd be interesting Let me think of something Aha oh yeah I didn't even watch all of season 1 I'm more invested in season 2 trainees anywayd ok i got one for you: breaking and entering/trespassing
oooh that’s interesting hmm lemme think of one for you ok here (sorry it’s kinda weird): project highrise	ok i remade it this looks more similar although i was looking for something darker for skin color but the darker tones werent the right type of tan since i'm brown rn
oooh I like it!!!	what is project highrise did u make one yet doitdoitdoit i didn't think i would like doing it but now that i did it's so fun
Just looked it up, turns out it’s actually a video game?? But I was thinking of it as a phrase like to build a story around some kinda project?! do what you will with it	oh interesting but it doesn't mean anything particularly? okay cool
And ahhh I haven’t done it yet I will!! I shut down my laptop already, before I saw that you sent a prompt Yeaaa I hadn’t meant for it to mean anything specific	i'm watching bio lectures rn but after i finish this lecture i'll take a short break and write smth before the next lecture lmao
daaamn you productive I’ve literally been reading fanfic all day	eh i'm way behind that's why i'm cramming rn i don't even think i'll pass which is worrisome considering i already invested this time in it but maybe when i take it i won't even need ot go to class then if i don't pass
Awww welp good luck!!! I believe in thou! but Yeaa then it can be an easy course! Ok also wait how long of a thing do we write or does it not matter	up to u if u don't like the phrase i gave u i'll think of something better actually something made up so u can interpret it let me do that actually unless u have an idea already
Naw I like what you have! Up to you tho I’m fine either way	lol okay then that's fine
I’ll prob start now and finish tomorrow or smth lmao *remind meee*	alright sure lmaoo don't forget to sleep early since we have plans tmrw i have to get my menb and hpv vaccinations tmrw afternoon lao
literally @you tho! Ik your cramming but don’t stay up too late watching lectures okay! and ooof ew I’m glad I’m done w those	ahaha i take so many breaks it's not even bad yeha they're the big needle ones lmao it doesn't hurt or anything when they stick it in me but afterwards i feel like a weird sore in my arms like you're afraid to move it even though it doesn't hurt that bad
Taking breaks is not the same as sleeeping!!! yeaaa omg that was me!!	sleep is for the weak okay facts tho i can't not wake up for a small moment early in the morning cuz i always had to wake up for work this summer but since i slept really late last night yesterday was okay
ohhh huhhh Well being able to wake up in the morning is good at least???	what names should i use what names do i like hmm
Tho annoying if you slept kinda late oooh!! Use smth interesting	yeah not anymore tho yeah lmao
Not a common name	i'm going for the chinese names ehe
Noice!!	but also i can't come up with legit soundning ones okay i'm looking up baby names now
haha I keep falling asleep early this week bc I’m still so tired from the weekend, I got 2 hrs of sleep and then was awake for like 22 omg a baby!! I’m excited or wait baby names	oh no what the heck
I used to do that; I would translate random words to Latin to make up names	ok i see u why were u up all weekend

Oh nooo
and like she was saying how she came to Michigan bc she was scared of leaving and stuff	Awww
And like idk we tried to comfort her and be like it’s okay to feel that way and stuff but argh I feel bad	It's okay though because I feel like having those feelings is normal I think everyone feels that way at some point
Also bc she said that she realized she can’t sleep well when other ppl are in the room so I’m just like Yeaaa I know I just feel bad tho	Oof yeah it's an adjustment period for sure
Bc she’s such a light sleeper too so like yeaaaa	Aw
No for sure everyone will feel that tho	Yeah I guess the most u can do is make her feel like she can find a community here too Not that it's your obligation
Yeaaa	Yeah that sucks tho
Like I feel like she hasn’t met as many ppl here yet so i took them w me when my orientation ppl invited me to hang tonight, and i think they all like clicked?? So hopefully that helped a bit too idk	Okay that's good Yeah finding people is important I would have felt so lonely here too without friends

But also don’t stress abt that too much??? like ok yea you might not really know that much going into it, but that just means more opportunities to learn right!	Aha idrk about that but I'm not concerned about the not knowing atm It's the fact that We have a deadline this thrsday To change some shy on a website And the new kids are assigned to it So me and this other dude are doing it and the other two girls who know a shit ton are doing the slightly harder one The other dude knows way more than me though

And just now he was saying how he was gonna go up to her dorm again and I’m like, isn’t it late already? And he said he’s probs just gonna stay the night again !! and lol ik it doesn’t actually mean anything but I just find it soooo funny for some reason hahah	Lmaooooo

like on and off? Sometimes it’s just muffled but sometimes it hurts ughh on another note So apps for consulting clubs are all due tomorrow and I’m highkey scared bc as much as I hate the stress of the moment rn, I’ve gotten so invested in one in particular, and if I don’t get in I think I’ll be v depressed	oh that's not good yeah u should get that checked out wow now that u mention it i think i should tell u i got rejected from both business orgs and poker committee and i was pretty sad and i am still pretty sad but like life moves on whether i like it or not and i have shit to do so i feel like no matter what life will still go on
Yeaaa that’s like definitely a good mindset to have, especially since we’re still just starting out you know? I am sorry you didn’t get in tho :/// You def do deserve it and are capable!!! But yea life does move on! And I guess this could just mean there’s an opening for something else?	mehh

Tis fine! how’re ya doing? dyou have to go to airport again later today?	Yee
Fun timess you doing ok?	Yeah It's honestly fine I'm just annohef But not even that much
mmm okok I’m excited to see you!	Yuhhh me too
I’m making cocoa rolls! (Like instead of cinnamon rolls) If they turn out good I’ll bring some for when we hang out 	oh shoot lol that's dope
awww they didn’t end up tasting v good tho I think I need to add more chocolate and also roll them tighter haha	Meh that's ok
omg did you land !	Yeah I did :)
YAY jamii are you almost here Ok so this story right The girl sihyun is from my orientation; she’s the one dongha added before meeting her and stuff They met through me bc we hung out w all my friends from orientation and they got p close p fast like He slept over in her room 2 nights bc it was late and she had a spare bed and stuff But then one night he went over to her room drunk and tbh idk what really happened here bc I was at home, but according to her he was hitting on her even tho she said to stop and he was mean to her friend or smth??? I don’t know tho this part is alll weird and fucked up And then she blocked him on everything and asked me to not bring him when we hang out And now even if they see each other from across the street it’s weird? Idk I don’t even really talk to her that much anymore so But yeaaa that’s the “couzens” drama bc that’s the dorm she lives in and everyone there “knows” what happened even tho it’s really dumb	like he liked her? oh goodness does he remember everyone there knows?
I’m honestly not sure? Like he says he didn’t buy idk	then why would he go there so often
He remembers going there and stuff but not what he said that triggered her Idk dude this was all over such a short time span too tho like within 2 weeks Yea shes part of a learning community hssp and he became friends w some of the other ppl in it too but none of them talk anymore It’s sad bc it’s actually kinda bad like I only hung out w her one time after and her and this other guy were saying they wanted to punch him? And also she started dating this other guy right after so idek	this isn't recent right because of the thing he did? uh so everybody in the learning community probably only knows it from sihyun's pt of view right not that it's wrong but the point is that they don't know dongha very well right has dongha apologized
3ish week’s ago maybe? Yeaa bc of this situation Exactly, they didn’t consider it at all which was why it was also weird for me to be friends w them after too He wanted to at first but she blocked him on everything so; and also he didn’t know what he was supposed to apologize for which was weird and now I think he just wants to avoid her and the topic altogether	hmm ok that's fair ig since it's kind of no longer recent idk does sihyun seem like someone who would overreact or miscontrue a situation accidentally yeah that's interesting it's probably a solidarity thing
like I don’t know her that well either to be able to tell? And I think I also am more biased towards dongha’s side? but also I’m bad at knowing if someone is hitting on someone and I personally would never think that so I don’t quite see where she’s coming from with being like “he was hitting on me and I told him to stop but he didn’t” Like what exactly he was doing that’s considered hitting on I guess? And if he meant it that way or if she was just interpreting it that way?	hmm ok yeah ig we can't really know seems like dongha doesn't feel great about it though so i would hope it wasn't like bad intentions on either end ig
Yeaaa I hope so too And that it’ll just blow over completely soon I feel bad every time I bring it up but in this case i just thought it made sense for you to know the story? But now I think he feels bad so ooof	oof yeah i feel
Heyy how’d your interview go?	it was pretty chill no biggie he said they offer summer internships as well so i'm hoping to do that instead though
oooh nice!! that’ll be cool, wait what company was this for? Also I watched joker omg it was actually so freaky	today was for nasdaq oh shoot lol yeah it's too creepy for me to watch
oooh nice And yeaa I don’t really think it’s your style like I’m ok w gore and stuff but it just had such an overall creepy dark and intensive vibe I was like...	i'm too stressed to have this movie watch*
awww	lol no like i just think it'd be too creepy for me
ahhh ya ya Wait have you seen Whiplash	the movie? sort of but not really i heard it was good?
hmm ok Dongha was saying joker reminded him of it and that I should watch it lmao	oh no that's too creepy i haven't watched a horror movie in years awful concept who would want to scare themselves for fun
I think I like horror movies! Like yea I actually get really scared by jump scares but I like it? also this is a cliche but I see how horror movies make good dates bc like if the girl is scared she’ll just hide in the guys arms or smth ya know!	Wait this is actually scientifically proven Wait did u cling onto dongha But yeah like studies show going to watch a horror movie increases good feelings between people
woahhh that’s interesting, I didn’t know it was that legit! And omg nono I did not	Mmhm Sure
But at one point he did cover my eyes so that was slightly odd What!! what’s that supposed to meaan	Lol mature dongha is strange
lmaooo he’s actually like a dad sometimes tho like they were tryna figure out apartments for next year and he’s the only one w a checkbook so	Oh shoot big man Who's he living with next year When do u guys get out of school btw
Uhh I think Daniel Choi, taejung and Somin? And for what end of year?	Yeah Christmas Oh idk taejung and somin
Depends on when ppl’s finals are	Oh is the schedule not out yet
Like I’m done Tuesday the 17th and I leave for India on 18th morning It is! I’m not sure abt other ppl tho	Oh wow that's a turnaround Wild Huh okay I'll ask dongha later Why r u still up Go to sleep
Oh yea I think taejung is from Rochester hills area and Somin is from Marini’s high school, okemos? Yeaaa that’s why I was sad at first when you weren’t gonna come back till Christmas bc I won’t really get to see you that break	Oh kind of close by michigan
And yea idk when dongha’s are Yea they’re all from Michigan And lmao I’m not sleepy yettt	Yeah I have a final on the 16th Idk when I'm coming back though
Ahh okok What times your final	It's the 17th morning Late morning I just checked my flight
Ohhh ok	My final is on the 16th Afternoon I believe
so like we could hang out that night but I’ll probs be packing so welp Ahh ok yea	Yeah that makes sense
Mine on the 17th is 8-10 am so I’ll prob be back in novi in afternoon if my parents can pick me up? How’s being back on campus?	Hmm ok It's just like normal but I'm making more of an effort to find a good study space since it seems like the room is only good when everybody is asleep
oooh huh okay Bc it’s quiet then?	Yee
I actually never study in my dorm anymore lmao I just can’t be productive!	Lol I fell asleep today in the library
omg why are you still up You just flew in today morning too!	I took a nap from 830 to 11

hmm idk? like highkey throughout the process we really didn’t know what we were supposed to be doing But considering that I feel like we did a decent job w what we could? And oh yea one of the apex sophomores was v helpful like I texted him that I was confused abt what to do and he shared 2 of his past executive summary documents!	Oh shit that's awesome
Ya he was so nice!!	I forgot if u told me this but have u been assigned a company for apex
oh like for a project this semester?	Ye
yea it’s a local start-up thingy? the stuff we get to do for them seems p cool but I find them lowkey sketch lmao one of the founders is a current umich student We actually just had an internal scope review today so like e-board looked over what our plans were, and they’re actually super insightful? as in they talked abt a bunch of other aspects we needed to look into	Oh huh ooh
I presented for the first time since ib biz!	Ayeee How'd it go Wait OK hmm
p decent I guess? My presentation part didn’t really matter that much haha it was mainly scope review board asking the project manager questions wait are you busy now/wanna call?	I'm sitting on the toilet rn but I was applying for some summer internships before but I can call u at the same time once I get out lmao
oh no you can keep applying!	lol it's ok i can call u do u want to
ok gimme a few min I’m on call w parents I can’t hear you The video chat ended. but bye! Have fun!	lol hi sorry i went upstairs to get boba
omg boba!! Def worth it haha	Lmao it was gone before I came back downstairs It's all gone
damn!!	like i drank it all now not like there was none left for me lmao
Oh yea lol ik, I mean wow you finished it fast	lmao it's a skill
ahhh I just texted one of the e-board ppl (the one who I said dresses nice) if he wants to go on a coffee chat w me texting ppl you don’t know is so awkward	lol ayeee congratulations
Nono wait till he texts me back oh shit I didn’t realize I actually had an apex meeting tonight that will be awkward if he doesn’t text me back and then I see him there	lmaoooo just ask him there then
:///// called you.	The video chat ended.
omg ok so like that guy never replied to me So I just group me-Ed the girl on on eboard who I said was really nice and she replied right away!!	Lmao didn't he see u in the meeting though
mehhhh I’ll just ask Amy on Friday if that’s even the correct number for the guy	oh man lmao
Omg he replied !!!	Lmaooo Did he say yes
Yea!! omg I guess i have 2 coffee chats tomorrow	Ayeeee
OMG what’s this I hear abt an internship????? Congrats bb!!!!!!	U and dongha omg It's for january But I don't have anything to do over the summer yet
I’m so proud!!!!! It’s okkk you have time for the summer	Lol thanksss
but yayyyy I’m so happy for you	Ye I hope so Haha idk shit though
For sure dwww	Gotta learm
ehh yea you can def learn! And you’ll learn on the job and stuff too	Yeah igs We'll see Yeah idk I thought I told u honestly Because this happened on Sunday but I guess I didn't remember Like Sunday while I was home
ohhhh omg I’m so late wait like fall break Sunday??	Uh Yeah
Wait	It's not official yet though
Did you tell me And did I already congratulate you	But like basically it is Idek lol
I actually don’t remember holy shit	Maybe I didn't
lmao dongha just texted me so I was like omg!!	I didn't feel like bragging so
Yea I don’t remember? I know you did say smth abt January so?	Because I don't think I really deserve it anyways lmao
And ehhh ya not bragging tho! Ok that’s FALSE You totally deserve it And you’re not allowed to question that	But there were only 5 applicants for that particular position so I just kind of picked that one
So what? You still worked hard and are incredible and smart and most definitely deserve any internship there is!!	Mehhhh Ok I know I don't have a lot of skills yet but I hope I'll learn some so the goal is to work harder and catch up I don't mind starting with less experience like yeah sure its a feelsbadman sometimes but Like whatever ill just do what I can do there's nothing I can change about the past
that’s very true And like It’s our current actions that still matter the most Bc we have so much potential to do stuff and you’re already so incredible okay  And I love that you’re so motivated to learn and improve but Try to not think of it as catching up? everyone’s at different points anyways and there’s no where you’re “supposed” to be It’s more that you’re striving to reach your own goals! And I know that you can definitely do that okay but  I get feeling bad abt that sometimes and I’m sorry you feel that :///  and it is okay to feel that, if you can use it as motivation and not feel put down by it?	Well yes I think this is true but I feel like it's not that I need to know what other people know it's that I need to know more in general to have more opportunities earlier Lmao not really I have no idea what the fuck I want out of this life anymore Confused and only really good at doing assignments (and this not really even lmao) so not sure what to do w myself sometimes Eh Im fine honestly I'm kind of over it
://// Awwww it’s ok to be completely lost or confused? This is our chance to begin looking for what we want to do I guess? I dunno  Ok but if you ever do want to talk abt anything, no matter what, I’m here okay? Always	Lol I'm completely fine lmao don't worry I feel like it's always natural to have concerns Or feel lost for that matter Mostly just ignore but not sure if that's right lmao 
Okayyyyy ummm yea not sure that’s the best thing to do ?? also omg so listen, coffee chat guy said he was down and even used three exclamation but when I asked him what time he didn’t respond why is this guy actually so bad at texting *exclamation points	Lmaoo Ye ah maybe he's just throwing his phone across the ocean after he texts u
ahah ok I think he’s actually just hella busy he just texted me back	Lol that's a better explanation
"My math prof:
“Max, can you tell us your name?”
Student: “Max”"	Lmao whar
he’s so funny I literally can’t	this mans
omgomg we’re finally in the situation where Dongha’s the one who’s tipsy/getting drunk and I’m more in control!	Omgggg Not a thing to be proud of
he just referred to himself as a bitch....	Lmaoooo
omgomg ok getting brunch w Marini and dongha rn And they’re finally talking to each other!! omg I’m actually fucking third wheeling this is why I told dongha he needs to just ask Marini on a date and not force me into it 	Yessssd This is good news
Nono you don’t understand I actually need to leave now tho But yea it is!!!!! I’m highkey excited omg	Just do it
but also can I pls ditch We’re at a restaurant can’t leave w/o paying the bill! ok so like we’re sitting at the bar area so it’s like me, Marini, dongha, so this is legit third wheeling where I’m on my phone and they’re talking like holy shit	Omfgggggg This could be good
Okok we finally left Yeaaaa	Ayeeee Now u should walk away from tgem
loll we just split at same time bc were all going home haha	awwww
oh wait btw how is Katie doing? Ik it’s such an awful thing to go through 	I think their home insurance gave them an apartment to stay I
Ohh ok	I haven't talked to her that much
Ahhh ok yea	yeah my mom gave katie a lot of my small clothes
aww okok that’s really nice of you guys	Yeah but she had an older brother too so I think they're doing OK mostly
Hi can you think of a caption related to fireworks?	boom chicka pop okay no *having a blasts*
what I’ll send you the pics!	ok please do starting off my first semester with a bang or a boom
Wiat I think these ones? maybe one other? Ahh but we’re halfway through first sem already!	yeah but still relevant starting off college then? this first semester has passed in a flash what else
hmmm wait should I make it more Diwali related bc of the first pic	celebrating my death in college with a bang
LMAO wait wait wb did someone say Diwali	wait what does this mean or just like a reference to diwali gee golly it's an internationale diwali
omg dyou actually say gee golly huh?	no not reallt lol like did someone say diwali a pun or just a thing
oh are you asking if it’s a pun? It’s just random phrase Prachi said it haha	oh it fits you it's cute and less weird
hehe yea I’m a diff species than you :)) and okkk I will post !	okkkkk
oh yea did he tell you abt Marini	good things or bad things he said it was going well last time i texted him
uhh when was that Bc not good  bc he wanted me to actually ask so I asked Marini today what she thought abt him	oh uh oh
and she was like I’ll only ever see him in a platonic way? and um she said he could be like her gay best friend which is eek	oh but he's not gay well what if she changes her mind
yea ik apparnwtly it was metaphorical but	oof you never know she could realize that dongha is the man for her like in all the romcoms and then everything will be okay
Yea I dunno I told him that too bc sometimes ppl think only platonicly but you never know what you end up feeling	mm don't push her though wait does she know he's interested
yeaaaa I dunno tho I think he said smth abt it being worth the effort??  Idk but I don’t want him to be sad abt it :(( I don’t think so? I dunno I tried to ask it generically Bc I remember him not wanting everyone to know,  smth abt rep?	he doesn't want people thnking he likes her? hmm
um just like cuz of I dunno, stuff that happened w taejung? bruh idek angmore what goes on in that boys mind	i mean is taejung's reputation ruined whatever i don't get boys
ehhh with Marini and like her friend? Same!!	"oh i guess why ""effort"" tho from what u said before if he likes her he should like her unconditionally"
I’m not sure like he used to even deny liking	ughhhhh
And then he said he was “scouting” And then he wanted to find out if she’s even interested? And that’s where effort comes in? oh yea he’s also stressed for 280 exam tomorrow pls make this boy feel less sad!	oh how am i supposed to help i'm so confused
I dunnooo	he never wants to talk about it
I know ack Anyways how’re you doing?	i'm alright i'm gonna be hosed next week so i'm facing some stress from that and i have some stuff to do this week as well but like meh
ohhhh awww oof omg this makes me think of a Nuckolls quote “The train doesn’t stop for anyone” or some shit	this is factual this train keep on chugging
yes ma’am You missed a video chat with Saranya. You missed a video chat with Saranya.	Heyyyy
hi haha sorry I called how’s your week been?	no it's totally okay what's up i'm doing ok i think i'm going to be a little hosed the next two weeks but whatever

awww sorry jams but also as odd as it is to say I do have more experience than Erin And yeaaaa it is!!	Lmao no I would like to think you're somewhat in control
the thing is Erin has only like drank once and it was in our dorm w me and dongha and I have a feeling she’s not gonna like frat parties at all	Not even like with her parents
Bc it’s just ppl like grinding on each other and jumping up and down	Yeah I don't think she will
Well she had but that’s diff	Bleh
Yea she knows she won’t like it either but she wants to experience it which makes sense yeaaaap Yeaaa as much as dongha hates on me I do know my limits	He said u wouldn't go to sleep last night
ok that’s differentttt I wasn’t tired!	This sounds verrrryy excusey Hmmm
Wait dude	Lmao

You’re good!	Are u still free rn
and yea sure gimme a min I’ll get my headphones too yepp!	Okay Good Furthermore, Hardin draws on the “tragedy of commons” principle several times within his essay to show how all sharing ethic attempts fall short in the long run. One such sharing initiative that Hardin explains is a “commons in disguise” is the World Food Bank (Hardin 373). Hardin proves this through an initial explanation of the “tragedy of the commons” through the pasture metaphor, which argues that people have no incentive to maintain a pasture if it is “common” to all. He makes the reasonable assumption that people will continuously draw resources from the pasture until there is nothing left at all. This is followed by an explanation of the founding ideals of the World Food Bank. By demonstrating the association of the bank’s principles to the pasture’s principles, Hardin contends that a food bank is not sustainable nor beneficial in the long run either. He supports this decision by forecasting the potential consequences of the opposing viewpoint. Hardin suggests a case study on India, a country with a population of 600 million increasing by 15 million every year. Should we attempt to save Indian lives through “medical or nutritional assistance”, this would only diminish the quality of each person’s life and “[hasten] the destruction of their environment”, Hardin says (Hardin 374). In this case study, Hardin cites that India’s current population and recognizes the very real problem of population growth the country is now faced with. Armed with this information, Hardin states that, in this case, “good intentions” may not be good intentions at all. Hardin’s efforts to disregard emotion in the case study allow him to analyze all possibilities without restraint and reach what he deems to be the best possible outcome, although it may be harsh.
The video chat ended.	Because no single entity has a responsibility or obligation to maintain a pasture that is “common” to all, he establishes that people will continuously draw resources from the pasture until there is nothing left at all. This is followed by an explanation of the founding ideals of the World Food Bank, where Hardin contends that because no entity controls or owns the resources within the World Food Bank, there is no incentive to add to it. fixed this section
okok I’ll take a look in like 15-20 min if that’s ok? Imma go take Erin a jacket and walk back w her	lol yeah for sure hope she's aight is she with anybody right now
Ya she doesn’t seem drunk but she’s not w anyone now so	oh okay good
yep we just got back! and okok I just read your passage I like the part you fixed! And like overall I think it’s really good I feel like the beginning is a bit confusing tho? maybe bc you say “commons in disguise” but don’t come back to it? ^bc it seems like that’s the main point of the paragraph since you say “one such sharing initiative” but idk maybe I’m just confused since I don’t know the piece you’re referring to also I really like your word choice throughout it! It’s really precise which is good but I think some parts there’s some redundant phrases you can maybe cut?	oh huh thanks ok i'll take another look at it is erin alright
ahh idk you don’t have to take any of my suggestions!	oh yeah i explain commons earlier
ya she’s showering now	ok good
Dyou still wanna call or?	i could but probably shouldn't my roommates just got back from their party think they're about to knock out for the night
Ohh okok no worries!	ah but you're going out tmrw night tho so i won't be able to call u ok i guess this is where i tell u to be safe again

Ahh but that’s fun when there’s less ppl or no?	Eh they were all elitist guys who were truthfully too good
omg I love the term elitist and ehhh also ackkk I feel really bad I think I’ve sorta been mean to dongha lately/I guess abused how nice he is I guess I’m just telling you this to help stay accountable to myself but I’m not gonna do random dumbass shit anymore ok! I’ll be the responsible mature adult that we know I actually can be and stop worrying ppl around me	why what happened yeah okay that's a good idea lol as long as u have a plan for yourself he's just worried about you yeah i feel like he just gets concerned when he thinks that you're not sure what your healthly limits are ig
eh nothing really we’re fine just I felt bad and like reflected a bit I guess and yeaaa ik I need to stop making ppl worry tho	hmm ok i'm sure if there was something wrong he would tell u i mean maybe if this is like an actual permanent lifestyle change he'll get used to it? as long as it's not like dangerous ig
I would hope soo and ahaha you know me, always living on the edge (aka submitting assignments within 60 seconds of their due date)	yes maam wait this is actually something you do without getting anxiety and i am so in awe
uh yea I did that for my English essay and somehow still got a 19/20 so	yes i will let u know too if there's smth wrong
highkey p proud	yeah so amazing

Bc I keep trying to reply to a specific message and I canttt	omg i'm so glad you're on this now so glad
LOL I mean the look of it is still slightly bothersome but oh well	it's utility not aesethitcality
hmphh but I love aesthetic! oh yea omg I went to cider mill today w apex it was v fun!!	whtttttt i'm so jealous michigan has nice ass apple cider i forget to appreciate it

WELL then I’ll take you next time!! tho actually you might have to take me bc I don’t have a car :// unless you wanna run there?	u act like i'll have a vehicle
ofc you will!	absolutely not
It’s only like 3 miles from the high school!	that's a lot of distance can u imagine the displacement wait actually tho won't it be so cold
LOL the displacement would be the same is if you drive there :)) ehh yea probs but we can just buy cider and donuts and eat it inside somewhere	so you're telling me we should drive in our nonexistent vehicle aight
ahah dw too much I’ll tech b allowed to drive my mom’s van but I’m just scared of it	Aight is this safe
hehehe def not in terms of parking omg	Mmi agree
hehe Hi honey sorry if I won’t be there when you come visit :(((( even if I do go I will hopefully be back Sunday night tho!! And I will def come hang outtt	Lol no seriously dwai I literally live in novi Will be there so often
that’s a lie omg but yea I just wish it coulda been any other weekend omg	Lol wait realistically speaking I am an old part of your life that has existed and will exist for a while but apex is arguably a very new part of your life that u should take the opportunity to get to know better So like this is like Nbd
yeaaa ik that’s literally exactly my thought process too like I think I’ve p much made my decision as long as my parents say yes too which they probs will it’s just a lol unfortunate but that’s okkk And yess you will exist as part of my life for a long long time to come!!	Lmao yes maam Yeah oh whale There will always be other times
Yeee	Omg so cute

Yea cheese bread and mozzarella sticks	Okay that's cool Dongha told me to tell u that u probably shouldn't go to west quad tonight Hes not well enough to have u Make sure u go back to the dorm and sleep okay After pizza house
I wanna go tho!!	I know u do But he said that u shouldn't
:(((((( he said	I know sorryy
He’ll be back by 3 so it’s fine	He said that before But I just called him And he's not really okay And he doesn't think u can come over anymore Soryyy But Make sure u go back and rest ok
oh You missed a call from Saranya.	You called Saranya. Not sure why you couldn't hear me I don't think my headphones are that good But I know that u may think that you know what u want to do right now and I agree but I just want to suggest that u do something good for yourself especially because you have to be up early tomorrow And I think that even if u get upset at me I'd still tell u those things Because I want to help you either way And I know that you're probably not happy with your exam and what your dad said to you but It doesn't mean that you should try to wash it away Because even if he's not being reasonable Think of it as motivation
I would never get upset at you!!	It's natural though To be upset at somebody else
Ik that would be right for me now too	Okay yeah I mean I just feel like I said
Eh he is tho it’s fine	Everything is kind of long run
Yeaaaa	Doing a good thing now and then for yourself can amount to eventual like Happiness You know people are always like blah blah is shortlived
No for sure tho I see that	And I feel like ruining yourself for a week or two can amount to things that aren't good for u in the long run Yeah it's just like
Thanks for always being here	Yeah ofc
okiii gn!	Good nightt
Hi jams	Hey What's up
not much! sorry if I worried you last night ahhh	how'd your coffee chat go no it's alright i'm sure u were fine lol

Lol he was saying the freshman in apex now would be his only friends when I comes back and I was like that’s so sad	awww lol damn connections saranya what can he do though no choice

.....jamssss	oooh tryna make money moves
remember back when you used to sleep by 1 every night	i see u nope
boi well don’t overwork at least ! Wait so yes or no? Bc I feel like emailing could be odd tho but idk	don't worry yesterday night i watched like 3 hours worth of kpop oh yes duh is he cute wait r u guys supposed to meet up or smth
no not really lmao	this is the umich matching thing no it'd be cool
it could be fun to just meet and make friends tho? Yeaaaa	pioneer kids are kind of pretentious tho more than friends* he looks so old is he does he play tennis he;s not worth it if he doesn't otherwise i can overlook his oldness
he’s a freshman too haha	what major
LMAO	wait just add him on fb and follow him in ig
Idk I just know bc his insta says umich 23 wait do both?	yeah why not
we only have one mutual on fb tho plus like	1 mutual is enough
what next After I friend him	You changed the chat theme. You changed the chat theme. You changed the chat theme. well text him and be like hold on
like dongha is sending an email to his person so like at least he can expect a response? vs a follow back?	i'm thinking of a pickup line
Omg no!!!	wait who's dongha's persoon no please wait it'll do with pioneer
I’m only cringey to my friends in real life sorry	are you from pioNEER because i'd hate for you to be far away
a junior who’s apparently president of a sorority?? Ill admit she’s hot lol, he’s sending a v nerdy email tho so WTF I’m not sending that holy	that's pretty standard dongha do it i'll venmo u 69 cents if u do
Lolll yea I’m curious how she’ll respond! wtf no $69 and maybe	wait if they have similar lifestyles tho dongha could be cuffed by thanksgiving maybe that's too son sooon christmas?
Holy omg that would be crazy damn!!!	are you from pioneer because i want to explore a relationship with you
I think he wants her to hook him up w other sorority girls or smth lmaoo ummmm	omg
Thats slightly better	thirsty ass hoe do it
but still hmm on insta dm tho? that’s like Definition of sliding into a guy’s dms and like It would be weird bc we do have mutual friends and that would be weird impression	Do it Fine just say hi then
wait But i don’t wanna like dm I feel like that could be awk	Omg so preproffessional
is it bad	No it's not I just never expected this version of you But I like ot
??? omg It’s smth I would normally say tho!! or idk is it weird ughhhh	No I like it
I think I’ll remove the smiley tho but also can I just email it	Lol yeah ofc
Or wait I forgot I think the msg I provided was my insta so I wanna see if he’ll follow me first?? or is that pretentious	Haha u can wait a day ig If u want
Okiii also your roommate friended me on fb! so now I can directly ask her for tea abt you :))	She's tryna to say bad things about me Ik
hehehe	She was gonna do thay Hoe
LOL	There's no tea
nono there is always tea ok	Nopeee
:)))) always tea	What did she say
that’s confidential Awww honey you keep the jar I gave you on your desk?? That’s so cuteeee	I do I like it a lot It's really cute
Yayayay I love you jams!! also we might make gc w anjalie me and Dongha do get ready to be fully exposed in all levels!!	I know U did Fuckkkk
hehehe omg this is so funny dongha shows me screenshot, and anjalie had said I’ve heard a lot about you - drunk things you can’t give bad impressions of us ! We are good wholesome ppl who drink safely !	yeah because i shittalked him all night mmhm mostly i just shittalked dongha because he was in denial
LMAO	about his state of affairs
Yeayea you’d never shittalk me :))	mmhm
omg state of affairs like his drunkenesss	yes and his thirsty ass
lmao that boi actually just needs to like hook up w someone	yeah idk what's up with him recently he falls into liking someone too easily
hmmm like w who	well idk i think he was pushing for the marini thing or like trying to force it when i felt like it wasn't at that point yet
yeaaaa ik what you mean it’s not like anything really did happen w that?	yeah igs
I think bc of the whole timing and stuff like	patience is a virtue though
They were hardly friends yet Yeaaaa	yeah if he's patient
you do have to do smth at some point tho	he's going to find a nice girl
you can’t be patient forever	is this about the thing my roommate was telling u about because i
Bc thing don’t fall into place if you don’t do anything abt it omg I was talking genetically genetically *generically omg but it does relate	because it sounded like you were subtweeting me anyways i agree if u feel like it's there and u want to be in a relationship u should go for it in general
uh huh in general but also subtweeting you obvi if you really don’t want a relationship and stuff don’t do smth you don’t want but also there is value in trying out low-pressure stuff And just figuring out what you like	wait ben and i are actually not a thing tho she definitely doesn't believe in that one that's definitely a joke the other one she might believe in a little bit more but it's also like not true yes maam
ok like I get saying that but still you might not be “a thing” but that doesn’t mean you can’t be!	no like i don't like him and he doesn't like me and i will not like him
hmmmm	because i can feel that we do not match
ugh I mean I def do not match w ppl I’ve liked but eh	ok wait let me explain it better
this is the chance to try it out still tho! ok fine	i do not like him even enough to consider him do u know what i mean You changed the chat theme.
yea yea omg what’s with the color changes! but yea I do know what you mean and thats fine	i just want to try them out
but still you never know what might happen so there’s no need to totally eliminate things	omg ok sure i'll keep it in mind but i really doubt it there's not really anybody i'm even interested in pursuing atm so like i'll definitely let u know if there is
okiii	and vice versa u should keep me up to date with your love life
mmmhmmm	and cute boi that u added on fb
There is none wait who did I add	and whatever your umich match's name was wait idk somebody mentioned a cute boy that u saw and they were telling u to make moves but i didn't see no saranya making moves
ohhh that was random and in the dining hall lmao Idek his name not do I particularly care lol there is 0 going on in my love life	meh sometimes u see a cute guy and you're like damn i'm probably never gonna see him again and then u missed your shot same here but u don't believe me
yeaaa I do!! But I feel like you’re more like oh there’s always gonna be 0	wdym always gonna be 0
^like I feel like you’re like you’re never gonna have a love life or smth actually I’m like that too wow I really am so hypocritical	haha i feel like to some extent i do want to but at the same time i'm not really actively hoping for it i mean i can see myself living my days out alone so it's not so bad because i can't imagine having a family at all
awwww that’s sad tho ://// But also I do get that? like I can’t picture the future at all I think I’m similar in some sense that I’m not actively seeking to date rn but also I think I would really like having like a person to myself, as possessive as that sounds? Like I guess I just want to be someone’s number 1 person but my thing with the future is more like I just can’t even imagine being alive to the point of marrying and having kids and I really don’t want to	yeah i don't even know what i'll be like next year yeah like someone else's number 1 priority? that would be really nice but ig i don't expect that much or want that much in the first place yeah i guess me too but sometimes i can like i would be living in a boston or new york apartment studio with maybe a dog or two idk how i envisioned it or why i envision it this way but the kitchen is always left and front of the door when i walk in and the living room is directly in front the tv is on the left wall and the couch is opposite of it
awww wait omg this is adorable	am i getting this from a movie or smth it's really weird
you’re adorable	idk how i have this image in my head
I mean, maybe smth you saw as a kid? It sounds a lot like the type of appt I lived in when I was young idk	there's like a small hallway between the living room and kitchen that leads to my room on the right and a bathroom in front maybe it is the other side is a mirror image though idk why there's always two bedrooms it's weird
I mean it is v cute but also you could literally end up anywhere and in any type of place so! Open to possibilities :))	you remember the appartment u lived in? yeah i don't expect that when i grow up but i always find it so weird that i have that particular image in my head it's what i always imagine when someone says apartment i am open to possibilities
not quite the specific one but also my babysitter through elementary school summers lived in similar appartments; all of those kind in Farmington hills are similar so	in fact i would really appreciate it if i didn't live in that sort of exact life because that would be specific
yea yea	and creepy
you can come see my appt next year!	oh i see wait i so want to i really like the idea of living in an apartment unless i had a family i wouldn't want a house
Yeaaa Like I wanna live in one of the hella fancy type of apartments they show in kdramas or like really high rise type of place omg the concept of when I grow up tho	haha you gonna make bank i believe in you damn what is even grow up
ahhh we’ll see we’ll see and damn yea I know This makes me thing of the song by NF omg	which one wait i think i really like nf
when I grow up	oh
me too!!	wait ig i don't know enough of his songs to say i like nf then
I really like his type of music ahh	i'll listen to it
lol I mean I don’t know that many either haha	oh wait no what am i saying
you can still like an artist	i do know that song wait jk maybe not hold on i'm listening to it now
YAY	lol
I really really like it	it's good i like it
yeaaa	that album is kind of like creepy bgm tho
huh is it? I really like quite a few of the songs	like the orchestral stuff in the background kind of eerie
ehhhh yea I think I really like that tho	damn i feel like having an existential crisis after listening to his music
awwww oh no!! i guess? it makes me feel fierce omg	haha yes i feel that but also existeNTiAL crISIS
Lololol omg His head Is gone	Yes maam
omg  you know the whole thing w me wanting to coffee chat w he eboard guy who I said dressed well? well we finally scheduled smth - not quite a coffee chat but a case interview and I was supposed to meet him at 1 today But we never even decided where we were meeting and he didn’t respond to my texts again or even my calls And then texted me at 1:30 smhhh	so it didn't happen? and he flaked ?
um yes issok we’re rescheduling Ooh I like this word	lmao flaked? it's not a good thing though he just forgot?
yea yea but tis a good word! um yea? I have a feeling he mighta been asleep or smth lmao sounds like smth I would do Tony told me he’s like that sometimes lolll so	Lol ok Relatable
I do actually just wanna take a nap now	do it just do it
boi I have class at 3 I most def will not wake up I also did set an alarm for 2:40 in case I do fall asleep	wait no that's fine that's like at least twenty minutes
.... omg look	"""host us?"" what does that mean"
host a party I think	r u gonna go and get hazed
The sophomores are known for being v tight knit and like have a lot of their own parties and stuff I think so lolll ofc I will Ehhh I doubt they’d be that extreme like dude Nexecon hosted a party for their new analysis like the week after they got in and actually hazed then so hard I think	wait what really lol i shouldn't have even asked this was a given how many people are in apex total
I think?? Like just w alc but shaily was saying smth abt forcing them to drink and stuff Hehe	uhohhh
Ummm I think maybe 40?	oh okay that's like what i expected
not sure tho, I don’t really know seniors yeaaa and Nexecon is more around 70 I think	will u get a chance to meet everyone at some point
I think so? like some seniors and stuff just don’t really come to stuff anymore which makes sense I am coffee chatting one today tho for ex which should b cool bc I actually don’t know anything abt her	is she still active
oh nvm she has to go to north for oh omg yay so I’m done for the day at 4 not really? Like that’s the thing I think most seniors are there as “advisors” and are like v helpful f you reach out to them but they don’t do much in terms of the regular club stuff	huh that's actually pretty nice though just chillin and helping out some youngins
haha yea it’ll be weird when we’re seniors omg what the oh! I finally planned out my 4 yrs of classes oh yea I said that in the highs and lows but just like it’s actually nice to have it done, even tho I’ll probs change stuff	omg i have not done that i have no idea what i want to take my schedule is a hot mess rn
ahhh issok you have time! when dyou register for next sem?	dec 2 i thnk is prere
ohh ok same-ish for us	yeah but ig technically registration is later in the new year but dec is just if u already know
ohhhh okok my like actual registration day is dec 5th or smth I think so we like “backpack” the classes now and see how our schedule fits	what does backpack the classes mean
hmm ok so it’s like you can add the classes you want? And put them in a schedule builder thing to see how the timings and everything work out too but it doesn’t guarantee anything like it’s possible that even if a class is in your backpack, it could be full by the time you register We’re required to add classes to our backpack first tho, like you can’t register for a class from outside of your backpack? It’s p weird	oh huh that's interesting our spring classes aren't even released yet them hoes
oh damn! Oh but your spring is also actually a spring and starts later	like there's like stuff on the course catalog but no timings or anything smh
it’s called winter semester here Ohhhh	lmao oh yeah
yea they only released ours thsi Monday so	r u going to take anything in the summer
probs? I def need to take physics at least wbu	uhhhh i'm hoping to find a job or do some research this summer i think that'd be nice i don't even think they offer classes here in the summer
yeaaa oh really? huh I’m probs taking physics at a community college	oh rightt u told me that yeah i don't think they teach during the summer here as far as i know there's no summer semester
Yea and will probs take some online ss classes too oh huh	u should travelll
that’s interesting I want to!! I’m so lazy to Apply to things tho	maybe over thanksgiving u can?
Yeaaa ooh wait lmao you up to anything now/wanna videocall	i'm about to get my lab checked off but i can prob call for a bit after i most free tonight after 9pm but u prob won't?

true! hmm idkkk ask them? ooh or like can Vicky host?	oh facts that would be nice if it's ok to do a big group thing u mean? dongha hasn't even approved so why bother
No like even in general bc I forgot abt the meat thing	like if it's ok to do your house? or like do we need to find somebody else's house?

which idk yet bc I need to reconfirm that face w my parents	it's your hosue u can sya like maybe right
wait what I’m confused now	like say u can maybe host or like you hosting might mean no met meat
wait lol that’s what I Alr said ohhhh ahhh I don’t wanna force that for dinner tho like I feel bad	no u can say like if i host we might not be able to have meta so if someone else could host it'd probbaly be better
ohhh okok Alr I’ll double check tmrw and say that! wait You should just host !!	i don't have any space in my house to host tho! my parents would also never let me host unless they cleaned up
You do!!! But okok We wouldn’t want your few days at home to be cleaning	seriously though my parents have done it to me many times and they'd be stressed about it too
No yea for sure hopefully my parents would be ok???? Just not sure tho	if not i'm sure we can figure something out

yea? I’m back the 31st wait when’re you going to Vegas	Uh like 21 Broooo Do u know how ivy day went for novi I've been on my feed all day trying to get info but nothimg
wait lmao i didn't even know it was ivy day i honestly have no idea, im not really in touch w any of the seniors now ahah	wait me neither but i haven't seen anything so i can't assume anything either
yeaaa dyou know who applied to where? also wait umich comes out next week then right	i only know srihari went early mit caltech and uchic i think ohhhh
ahh okok i hope he gets smth!	yeah idk he sounded a bit cynical last i talked to him
literally only senior ive talked abt college is lucia and ik she really really wants to get into umich so i hope that works out ahhh he's like that tho i dunno where he would actually wanna go tho	he's lacking in ambition rn i also don't know
hmmmm	i felt like my senior fall i wasn't even in that sort of state of mind like seems unhealthy
idk ig i sorta relate? wdym by lacking ambition	like he just feels down
awwww yea senior fall is rlly hard	well idrk
like mentally	but he posted on his story about how he doesn't want to try for deca states and i feel like he doesn't relally care about deca either so that's probably why
oh yea is saw that	but like idk he doesn't seem super satisfied or happy but at the same time i feel like he wants to give up and that mindset has been with him since i last saw him so i think he's not handling it mentally well
ahhh hm last time as in like before we're in college? idk yea srihari does have a v confusing mindset i feel	uh columbus weekend yeah i feel positive compared to him lmfao
ohhh okok yea im not sure/not sure if he is sure either of what he wants/does make him happy? like actual things? idk i haven't talked to him in a while	meh neither have i ig i'm just speculating
lol you are sometimes positive	ehhhhh
no yea lol but idk i lowkey wanna just text him randomly now and be like hows it going but that might be odd	do it u wont'
idk should i actually? like what do i even say	wait actually idk if i should because does uchic come out today? or did it cuz i actually didn't text him on purpose today because i wasn't sure how novi was feeling atm
uhhh not sure abt uchic	yeah it's not really an ivy right
but wait yea ig its a strange day to randomly text yea its not like i didnt evne know it was ivy day but if we all of a sudden text ppl we havent talked to in a while today that would be not the best idk im also considering visiting novi on tuesday so maybe ill run into ppl?	oh wait really i have to visit pohl sometime
lows dyou wanna videocall rn	i won't be back until 17th tho
oooh yea imma try to	can't roommates asleep
ohh okok	yeah tomorrow tho i'm really free lmk
and yea tuesday's the only day i can go so imma try but i dont wanna have to get a visitor's pass so maybe ill just go at 2 pm and see who i can catch?? and okii yea lol my only plans tmrw are to study	oh huh
aka be unproductive	i don't know that many people at novi anymore i realized surprisingly the person i've talked to the most from novi is kevin lim
huhhh	because he always randomly texts me when he sees i'm online usually at 2am
i like dont even know him	yearbook
omg wait guess who randomly texte dme the other dy ohhh	and he's been texting me every since lmao just like now and then but yeah who
adi! he's doing apparel and accessories marketing! and ahhh okok	sinha??? uhhh
yeaaa	bianca's bf?
lmao yea yea	oh yeah i know him sort of
like last year in physics i always plugged it to him and srihari but im surprised hes actualy doing it	ah yeah wait if you like fashion tho it's like just a fun event to do
yeaa or its just like one of the ones you can b really creative in and its easier when there's a specific industry bc you can actually like just know a few companies and b good idk i hope he does well tho bc he asked some questions and i said i could share my material w him but it wont be till like after regionals obvi so	yeah huh also katie has been texting me a lot and like idrk how to feel
dong?	yeah because
abt what	i just everything literally everything like things i wouldn't have any expertise in she asks me for advice and idek how to respond because like idk i just feel like she should try to make her own decisions and i feel like i'm doing that for her rn like idk if we just didn't have someone to ask or at least i didn't really have like one person i could always ask but i think in a way it was helpfjul for me to just guess and go with it sometimes
yea no it definitely teaches you a lot to figure stuff out for yourself? idk tho like	yeah idk how to tell her this tho i've been kind of giving her more vague answers lately because idek what to say
i sorta relate to her bc i someitmes did that w my brother (who told me to figure it out) or shaily (who i learned on my own i didn't want to ask everyting)	yeah i can def agree it's so nice to have somebody to ask
but yea no like she has also asked me some rnadom stuff abt event chairing idk maybe she just needs	and i've done that with so many people
like an older ifgure she can rely on rn?	yeah i understand that so i've been trying to be helpful but in terms of like long term mentality and wellbeing i don't know if i'm doing the right thin
yeaaaa ik what you mean	likei just feel like
hmmm idk tho like i feel like	she acts like my way is the only right way and i can say for sure it's so wrong
its only effective when the person realizes it too	i did everything backwards
that they need to find their own path	the hard way and twiceover i was dumb
oh yea she def tries to follow what you ddi a lot which is like yea	wait yeah this is so true this is my dilemma with my brother rn too cuz like i just want him to do smth he wants to do
yeaaa	but at the same time when i was in middle school i didn't know what i wante and i relied on my parents to help me even though i was an asshole to them i still felt like by forcing me to do some things
ahh like in middle schoo;	i was better at figuring out what i really wanted to do later
its still helpful	yeah he's just it's puberty
yea you like did a lot more for yourself in high school idk i think for me it was a big thing i realized, liek that i didn't want to do things my brother did?	yeah definitely
but i almost took it to an extreme where i would avoid things just bc he did them even if i had an interest in it too	oh yeah maybe ig i think i know what u mean
but now i think ive taken a step back and its just like yea im my own person and its ok if we do like the same things? yeaaa	i have a friend who wrote his common app about like exactly this he has two older sisters who went like princeton yale smth like that and his essay was about how he didn't want to do mun cuz his sisters did it and he eventually ended up doing it anyways and then he found that he could still like it idk the message was good at the time i was reading it i thought it was a bit too much how he wrote it but the idea was good
ahh yeaaa thats like, i really get that	also i have mixed feelings about him now because he's under that investigation
investigation?	title 9 wait did i not tell u
oh what no you havent	oh well his name is kylen and like he came over to harvard like 2 to 3 weeks ago for some event and was styaing with my friend helen who now has a single cuz her roommate took a leave of absence and then this girl we know from yale (which is where kylen also goes) called helen in a rush one day and told her that kylen is currently under a title 9 investagation because he got drunk one night and took a girl back to his room and like locked the door and wouldn't let her out and idk if anything happened but clearly it wasn't good
damn wtf thats scary	yeah kylen is kind of chaotic but i never thought he was dangeorus he was always like a 6 foot 3 whatever puppy
ok but thats like bad chaotic	to me
yeaaaa	and then just like idk ig i should have realized earlier and i don't think he's all bad but
i mean no don't say that ho would you think that no yea it slike drunk = bad changes ppl	yeah i mean how much though like nisarg gets drunk and brags about how much he loves pranati like it's about what is on the inside
you don't think abt what you're doing, or what the consequences are? it is but like	well yeah but it doesn't matter
for sure	if u had personal values your drunkness doesn't
its not an excuse in any case	affect those just your inhibitions yanno like
yeaa like clearly it shows that he valued smth over someone else's choices and like thats not ok	yeah idk he was still really nice when he came over and friendly and we hung out w him because he doens't know that we know so there's that
mmmm i feel like iver heard a lot of sketch things abt ppl that i didnt know like smth with nitin?? i mean	oh right that thing with nitin
its not like hes all bad or smth but	yeah
yea i didnt know still don't really but its just like i dont understand how someone could do smth like that	yeah it's hard for me to reconcile the two things
yea	or like yeah idk but idk how we got on this subject
its esp hard when its someone you knwo well too like haha yea idk eitehr its	right this is like
interesting tho	the first time i've known someone this well and this happened
ahhh yea i dunno	yeah i totally thought i told u but ig now
its like what are you supposed to be feeling	not right right
loll yea i feel like you think you tell me a lot of things lmaoo idk anyways how are you doing these days	idk how this happens it's alright i had a bit of an existential crisis and my regularly scheduled feelings of worthlessness and then i was like aight not relaly but i'm good i'm keeping myself entertained have to try a little harder since class is out rn tho
hmmm okok awwww	wait no this is like a humble check though
ye thats good	not that i in particular need it
lol yea but like when were you not humble jamie yeaaa	but i hear this a lot from mit students that like being at mit humbles u and like this is true
yeaaa	i mean i was pretentious as fuck when i was younger i probably still carry that tint
lows i feel like college in general too bc you realize how small you are ahh i mean	i watched that vanity fair billie eilish interview today yeah
idt you were ever really pretentious ooh how was it	ehhhhh debatable well i was kind of like shook she was like more mature at 15 then i am rn lmao i mean like maybe but i feel like she's just an interesting person to watch and i wouldn't want to be watched growing up if i were her
huhh yeaa ive never seen one of her interviews	i don't even listen to her music that much in fact like i listen to none of it rn but
lolll	i think as a person she's like generally non-artificial or she tries u know
yeaaa ik what you mean	and that's like a valiant effort when you're big and rich as fuck she also called drake nice tho and i've heard some sketch things about it him* but like the people u surround yourself with when you're in the music industry it's like unavoidable and it's not like you can do anything about that
yea yea	idk i hope she doesn't lose the perception of being
like i think ppl put too much weight on who you are associated w sometimes	a normal human being
like yes it matters but also who you are is more imp yeaaa	yeah true
haha guess who i listen to on repeat these days	bro no clue tell me i saw txt on your spotify but idk
lewis	if that's who it is
capaldiii	ah capaldi yeah i've seen that too r u sad lmao
a lil haha	aw man why
his music and voice are soo good	wait tell me about u i haven't heard anything recently
ahhh i mean just life moving ig	what part of it is it the pace or like the people
idk i feel like i don't get sad abt academics too much? like stuff like that i already expect to be stressful and stuff yea idk its like ppl i dunno somtimes i wake up or at night its just like who even are my friends here ooof	oh huh
im excited for next sem tho	yeah i feel that
will hopefully meet some ppl	it's easy to be lonely
who like me yeaa	i think i'm going to tyr try more to meet some more people but idk
yeaaa	the people that probably vibe with m are also probably not going out all the time so how are we supposed to meet each other
like the thing is i feel like i try but i dunno, like there has to b mutual interest in friendship ig?	also i've been trying to learn the guitar recently
omg you can study together oooh!!	that's true
play me a song omg	i'm really bad awful honestly
uh huhhh	how do i find randos to study w
you'll get better tho lmao	i'd have to meet u in class probably
idk	i think i need to push the social part of me a little more cuz i have it and then i get lonely when
im good at meeting people initialy but no one sticks ya know? like we have fun the one or two times we talk but its like they arleady have close friends and i just	it doesn't have an opportunity to be social
feel irrelevant	oh i see
ahhh yea	yeah that's so hard college friends are so hard to make omg
yeaaa :((	i'm trying! it's just slower than i expected
yeaaa i dunno ig i sorta hoped it could just click for once its like, i dont even need that many ppl literlaly i would be happy having like a small group of 4 friends thats really close and are like go-to ppl bc ive never relaly had that	yeah i see u it's just hit or miss though it really does
i honestly feel like its easier to connect w upperclassman sometimes but its like obvi i wont be their closest friends	rely on some luck i feel like
yeaaaa and like	oh huh why do u think that
we do have so so much time i dunno, theres some sophomores im just more comfortable hanging out w/talking to? or even like some seniors	yeah i see ur point tho
but yea i mean ppl have told me that they don't even talk to their group from freshman yr anymore and have found the right group of their ppl later so like and ik it'll be fine i mean	"""time heals all wounds"" not relevant"
haha	but
does it	i'm also hoping it'll be fine
or does it just cover htem up	no it really doesn't i'm still embarassed about kindergarten and fourth grade
it willll we will figure this out LOL omg	yessss josh krueger if you're out there i'm sorry brendan downs i was fucking dumb for liking you and alexis whatever your face is you played me
omg omg  i don't even remember these ppl	LMAO I DO BECAUSE IT WAS TRAUMATIC FOR 4th GRADE ME this is why i have never liked since
omggg its so long ago tho!	i have lost all capacity to love
ahhh i get that	my life is over the bloodline ends w me
omg no you have capacity to love me tho	well yes this is platonic love
issok victor can continue the fu line yes yes	oh true
platonic love is highkey superior	bro SO SUPERIOR
yessss wait should i go back to my dorm rn im highkey not being productive and i was stupid and came to the library in only a sweatshirt but im still highley caffeinated and will not sleep lmao	bro it must be so cold bruh ugh i can't drink coffee anymore and nothing works to keep me awake i sleep through the tea pepsi and coke don't have high enough caffeine amts for it to be really effective so i can't even stay up when i want to
yeaaa like i didn't used to think coffee even did anything fo rme but then i had black coffee and like that shit is so gross but makes me so like hyper energy in like a frantic way ugh	wait i hate frantic energy tho like i get so jumpy and i feel like my heart wants to just make me nervous for no reason gives me goddamn anxiety idk if i have an issue tho like sometimes i'll just be talking and then if i get too excited or invested or anything sometimes it's like nothing my body will just start to get anxious even tho my brain isn't so my legs and hands will shake and my voice will get all weird and my heart will feel weird and sometimes i'll get warm idk it's so weird it doesn't happen often tho idk not that often at least
ohhhh yea i feel like a lot of ppl react to caffeine badly or like it makes some ppl's stomachs hurt too i think idk my franticness is like all in my fingers haha	lol yea it doesn't do that to me unless it's a lot but even a little bit gives me a headache these dauys it's not the caffeine tho i think cuz it's in other htings i drink maybe it has to do w like coffee itself or milk idek
ohhh huh maybe like what did you drink for caffeien wait btw whats your texting plan/can i text you instead of messenger	yeah u can it'll be green tho like coke, tea, pepsi even like the starbucks like caffeinated lemonades Apparently somebody from the boys tennis team got into princeton

I should hopefully have WiFi during most parts of the trip at least so :)) also omg update!! Got accepted to the Ireland study abroad :))) problem will now b to make my parents let me go hahaha	Ayr that's good Oh fuckkkkkkk that's awesome
Yeaaaa in Chicago now! lol that was both the shortest and longest flight I’ve ever been on idt ive ever fallen asleep that quickly	How many hours lol That's good A good sleep
Lmaooo it was literally 45 min so not even but now we get a direct flight to India so yay ! omg ok this it totally random but I was just thinking, wow I’m surrounded by more brown ppl than I’ve been in a while And then I realized I’m literally going to the country of brown ppl	Oh shoot nice Eat some good food on the plane lol LMAO YES That is true Laso Also * I got blocked my the security from entering the building today
LOL what time did you go?? That’s why I went at 2 pm haha I didn’t want to have to sign in as a visitor ugh we’re going on air India so I have v low expectations	Like lunch time Thwy said I could only go at like 2pm otherwise I have to have an appt Ngl I kind of like airplane food It's not great But it's interesting
ohhh ok are you just gonna go at 2 then and ok I do too sometimes like Delta is fine and our flight to Italy actually had some v good Italian food I’m just always doubtful of airplane Indian food loll	Can't I have a physical appt Well yeah it's italy
ohhh aww, maybe tmrw then? haha yea but it was a sketch air canada flight so	Yeah that's what I was thinjing Oh huh nvm then
I might go again on the mon or tue before I college starts again to see like Forster lol Hehe I feel like I say every non-delta flight is sketch	Delta is pretty nice yeah so everything else in comparison is jusy Oh boi yeah no I don't think I'll go see her
LOL damn last spring seems so long ago Yeaaa like delta movie selection too	Wait bro I watched the movie 27 dresses on the way back And started like 20 minutes of isn't it romantic …smh
wait is it good?? I think this flight has it and it’s trueee	Bro Watch it
haha okok what kinda movie romcom??	Yes Duh Both of them are
ofc ofc okiii I gotsa go now	isn't it romantic is rated R tho So maybe not watch it with your. Parents
not sure if this flight has that haha oh okok	Ah ok
byeee!	OK good luck be safe have fun
holy shit this movie is so funny!! I thought the sister was fine at first but daaaamn I love how Jane and Pedro both really went at it together but ooof awww now it’s making me sad I just want everyone to b happy	LMAOO Wait it's so good Did u like it
Yeaaa i really liked it omg Haha I watched like 4 total movies I also saw miss peregrines home for peculiar kids; Deadpool; and romancing the Stone	I've only watched deadpool How r the other two Also how did u even watch deadpool
lol wdym how? It was on the plane! and they’re p good haha I really liked Miss peregrine one but I haven’t read the book which is probs better? The other one is a really old movie that’s kinda wack, there’s an Indian movie I’ve seen that’s like based on it tho which I why I wanted to see it It’s nb tho!	Like Your parents I haven't read it either Lop wait it's a movie based on another movie
wait Deadpool doesn’t have anything bad tho? And I was just w my dad who was asleep Haha like the American movie is the original A lottt of Indian movies are like based on random American movies I think	Rated R Isn't there like many sex scenes Oh what First time hearing this
uhhh it’s R but there’s no full sex scenes? Or nudity? like it’s just the usual making out scenes or whatever	R u sure u even watched dead pool lmao I don't remember it like that Or maybe you're a changed woman
LMAO Wait no I think after I watched game of thrones Also when did you watch it haha	Idk maybe 2 years ago
Ohhh wait I just looked it up and I mean ig it does have stuff? wait I’m unsure now	Maybe it was censored cuz it's on the plane?
dyou think they adapt stuff for planes yeaaa	Bruh idek
that actually makes sense bc imagine if there’s just a lil kid sitting next to you or smth	Lmfaoooo That'd be so sad but hilarious Ok Anyways I gotta sleep 3am over here

omg why are you still up!!	Vegas baby Only 1239
Ohhh like I bought the dress at a store and went to a tailor at a separate shop If I buy material instead of a half-stitched dress the tailor has more work to do so then we would pay her more lmao Ayyyyy go play some blackjack!! Win me some money	Oggg Ohh Oh huh So she was tryna get monay
I’ll probs wear it at some point and send better pic but here’s colors! I mean her point was true	Still illegal for me alas Gold I like it Meh
The half stitched stuff isn’t good bc it isn’t right for my shape? Like this one is completely ready-made but they just had to adjust the top and it fits me now so Awww welp are you going to shows?	Oh I see Yeah mostly shows and tourist attractions
Yeaa that’s what we did too Send pics!!	I'm not a pic person but OK Forgot I'm actually on LTE rn lmao

Ohh okok We just got here! Wya? Good luck on your first day at work!!	Thank u bb
Hi! How’d your first week go?	it was kind of sad and lonely at first but it's getting better
awww I’m glad it’s getting better! did you meet new people	uhhh honestly there's not a lot of opportunities too i'm at work all day basically on weekdays and then when i come back i'm too tired to go out i'm getting to know the people on my team a little bit better though what about you how are classes lmao
ahh yea that makes sense dyou like the work youre doing? and mmm i dunno, im honestly really worried for my coding class bc i genuinely dont know anything	i finished like the required scope of the project mostly
but hopefully they'll be ok	has some more stuff to do on monday and tuesday but then i'll start to explore more interesting things i think nooo it's okay you'll learn you learn very fast
oooh okok that should be fun	and nobody knows anything at firs t
LOL i hope so, im still not 100% on whether i should do comp sci hopefully can figure that out through this class tho lmao i havent met too many ppl, but i do know at least one person in each class now which is nice? and for my musicology class we have to watch like a movie every weekend and this girl i met and i are gonna watch it together tomorrow so im excited for that	well there's still time make sure u do something u like yayyy that's good i'm hoping i'll meet some interesting people next semester too oooh musicology sounds AMAZING
yeaaa Yea!! It’s hard but fun too And ahh I hope so, idk how much I like the prof but the class itself seems v cool!! like it’s specifically abt music in science fiction movies too so	agree i guess you'll find out lol oh interestinggg
yeaaa go like my post!	Wait where
oh wait ig it doesnt show up? i updated my cover photo!	Oh wait I'll check ok i liked it i think hack does spring recruitment too so maybe i'll have smth similar to share
oooh yea yea ahhh the difference between calling it winter and spring is so weird	oh wait what u call it winter recruitment? but u have two summer semesters when you're on break so what do u call the semester between winter break and summer? winter???
wait yea like this is winter semester rn and 4 mo of summer is divided into spring and summer semesters	bro the fuck how does thata make any sense whatsoever
lmao I mean weather wise tho? Bc it’s so cold rn!	wait bro it was almost 70 degrees today absolutely crazy
omg what!! That’s so nice it was raining all day here And v v windy	Aha yeah u guys are about to have a storm
ughhhh omg that’s so bad the sidewalks are alr so slippery	with ice? bro it's nearly 70 again here today what is going on
Yeaaa I’m wearing my winter boots and I still keep almost slipping wtf I’m so jealous! I want 70	haha i mean it is really nice honestly but i don't know why
mm yea that’s really wack, esp for Boston	yeah it shouldn't be this warm right
yeaaa whatcha up to now/can I call for a tiny bit haha	yeah sure i'm just sitting at my desk trying to read some research papers lmao and failing what have u been doing all weekend oh wait can u not hear me let me restart the call
called you.	You called Saranya.
arghh I think I lowkey fucked up like they asked abt weakness and I should’ve thought abt it before but no so I mean I was honest but idt its a good answer to give, I said my weakness was like being confident that my own rwork is good and a resource to share	oh i was actually going to ask you how it went so u said your weakness was that u were overconfident about yourself?
Ahhh I mean like it was still chill I really like both of my interviewers haha	ok that's alright then
no underconfident lmao	oh wait that's not so bad
I mean I dunno I feel like I didn’t present that part of myself in the best light but Other than that it was ok?	oh don't worry about it too much i'm sure u did really well and you're just overthinking
mmmm I hope so!! I won’t even find out for a month basically bc everyone’s so busy w recruiting Haha aren’t I always	oh how are they supposed to remember then yes but surprisingly no sometimes
mmm I mean I think they’re thinking over it now? And our involvement during recruiting weeks probs also can help?! Idkk	hmm ok well good luck with this week then lmao
here thanks! And oh v v true I’m either hella impulsive or overthink everything very extremes	yes this is true
oops	Huh?
Lol I meant in the sense that I probs shouldn’t be in the extremes	Oh Well Its not so bad
mehhh hi how’s your week been?	Hi saranyaaaaaa It's been not bad so far I've been kind of bumming at work but then today I got kind of a lot of info dumped on me that I don't really understand What about you? How's apex recruitment going
oof ok I’m sure you can figure it out tho! ahh ross was kinda annoying so things couldn’t start till today, so it’ll pick up tomorrow? I’m also actually considering trying for finance club or a vc club so that’ll be a bunch of applying stuff again	Ross manages it? That'll be really interesting if u do who knew u were such a business gal
Yeaaa like they had a bba meet the clubs today and no ross-affiliated clubs were allowed to have recruiting meetings before it happened hehe I highkey am, like I complain abt t but I lowkey do like networking and everything also omg business gal sounds so much better than rosshole	Lmao weird Wowwwww networkinggg Aye nice
oh omg I also saw Robert’s girlfriend today!!	Oh the remote from Cali one?
Yeaaa	Was she visitng
yea she's visiting this week i think lol they're so cute!	Oh awesome that is cute Aight I'm heading the sleep now Lmk how tnrw goes
Okii Wait can I ask a real quick question dyou have idea for how to code to get mode of a list of numbers?	Uh I think just store numbers and how many times they appear in a dict/hash table Then pull the max from the values I think that has O(n) runtime
uhhhh ok	So you iterate over the list And for every number u if a key exist u += 1 and if it doesn't u make a key in the dict = 1 as value Then at the end U find the key with the highest value
hmm ok I’m doing similar iteration concept but idk what key is? Issok I’ll get it, thanks!!	I guess those don't exist in c++ Well They should because hash tables have them But like u can store data like {key = value} And reference value by calling the dictname[key]
ahh yea they probs do I just haven’t learned abt them before ohhh huh ok will def look into that	Yeah just search up dictionary Should be pretty easy to get the hang of it
oki go sleep haha, gn! Yee hopefully	Okok Gngn
Hallo! wanna call 	hi sure i'm trying to get some work done but we can chat how's your week been everything good?
yea! I was just gonna call for fun haha i also have work so we can do another time :)) and twas p good? busier for sure lol	alright how about tomorrow haha i bet lol any recruits you have your eye on

eh ig but usually they send an email? Also like they only took in 5 ppl and no one really turns down Nexecon so it’s basically a no also omfg ok so one of the ppl on board for gic is my ross peer mentor in one of my classes and look what he texted me:	You did do well What does this have to do with isha?
nah I don’t think so lmao That’s what I don’t know like I want to know what she said but I’m not gonna ask and this guy also definitely was not supposed to tell me that	lol he was very honest so they thought u didn't have enough of an interest in finance but primarily this is isha's fault i thought they meant interest in isha for a second and iw as like what

hii how’ve you been?	Hi p tired wbu
Yeaaa me too there’s just so much to do and so little time	:(( I feel that
ok but as annoying as coding is it’s actually like Fun to do it w people	Uhhhh Yeah Partially true
Yeaaa oh yea the other day!! I got asked a sorta-technical question in an interview it was so scary they were like “explain what you’re learning in your coding class”	Aye not bad Do u think u answered it well
mehhh idk Thankfully I have an at least general idea of smth we’re learning now so I didn’t blank or anything And I was sorta able to talk abt how it applied to current project so?	Oh cool that's a really good answer yeha
ahhhh idk we will see tho! oh I went to karaoke for the first time the other day!	I know lol U and Erin called me For your birthday
OH YEA dude the number of ppl Erin called that night And number of random dcd ppl I talked to	Lol is she doing alright She was so sad
awwww yea ik idk, I think she’s like mostly fine but also really lonely?	Yeah seems like it hmm
like I’m home this weekend and we ft-Ed to work on lab and she was talking abt being lonely but idk how I can helo	Oh no :((
ughhh yea like she def has some good friends but also I think first semester she kind of hermitted a little?	That's me All the time ll Lol
and it is harder to make friends this sem, esp bc most classes aren’t required and if you don’t go to lecture and stuff you don’t meet new ppl yeaaaa	Yeah True Did she join any clubs
no that’s like the other thing, she went to some meets for one of the Engr car team things last sem? and she’s been more actively going to one for a diff one - MRover - this sem?	Oh that's good It's hard to find a community But really nice when u do find one
like for engineering idk abt the club stuff as much but I think it’s a lot more open format and it’s def how much time you decide to put in/hard to become a core part of the team when there’s no required stuff? yeaaa yea for sure and sometimes even when you think you find one it’s honestly like a lot of time/work you gotta put in to stay or maintain relationships with ppl and It’s easy to just let things fade	Yeah ik Everything has to be maintained in college
!! So true	Why r u still up omg I'm about to sleep
ahah yea me too dw I got my lab to 10/10 in only one submit!!	BEAUTIFUL

Lol we don’t have any set plans We can plan around when ur free so maybe let us know when ur free between now and Thursday night?	do u want to do something between 330 and 6 when my event starts then? doesn't necessarily have to be dinner because food in cambridge is good but not that good so u guys should go somewhere fancier

You can take us to your favorite place! also where in mit should we meet you	haha i have no idea what i'm gonna do between now and 6pm tbh uhhhhhh there's a thai food place it's smol but p close i'm not a foodie lmao idk what is good

ohh huh really? I’ve never added egg to a mug cake Also don’t have egg at home LOL but yeaa it actually had relatively good texture too so eh	I thought it was the egg white that did it Honestly sometimes the egg makes the cake too stiff Stiff sponge like I wish I had cocoa powder

oooh omg what is it!	OK so like I realized why girls like tall guys OK so for context I was on yt and I came across the second Chinese produce And this time the pd is caixukun Who is you know Jessica's favorite atm
yes yes he’s a cutie	And he was like watching this girls performance Omg u too And like he stood up to go correct her And I was like tf He's like a foot taller than her Maybe not a whole foot But I was like tffff
LOL How does this lead to that realization tho??	Like when u put him next to other guys it's just like average OK so Yeah The realization came when It pans to the girl looking up the guy right And im like doesn't every girl want someone to protect them And like when you're physically tall
awwww	You have the evolutionary advantage Girls have to like physically look up to see yoh
yes yes being hugged by tall guys is so comforting like	Omg
youre completely enveloped	LOL
I’m so glad you came to this realization jams!	OK that's all
 ok wait now imagine	No I mean like It was ever present But I was like it can't have that much of an effect Just being taller
a guy like back hugging you and resting his head on top of your head bc of his height isn’t that cute	9 Omg
smh non-believer	Idk why the 9
It’s ok you’ve been transformed	It's gross cufe Have i
I used to complain but I honestly quite like my height lmaoo Yesyes you are a	I still wanna be taller
Realized jams	In what way
mmm I want like killer tall heeled boots in the ways of cute hugs by tall ppl ! or strong ppl too ig *comforting hugs aww now I miss hugging people smh	Uhhhhhh Haha it's not so much the hugs I believe in But I do think that being tall is an evolutionary advantage for reasons aside from physical ability It's like Rip we all be lonely
*evolutionary*	Lol but like seriously
LOL bc it’s appealing for *potential mates*! I mean yea fr tho	That is what j was going to say nedt Sometimes women take it too far tho I saw a post today about bucks whose antlers are so large it like Incapacitates them
awww	And boars that's alters drive back into their skull All because of girls smh
omg You can’t compare us against other species!!	Lol girls are crazy tho Legitimately I think we're all batshit crazy I think men are idiots
Oh yes for sure	And women are crazy
I was just talking today abt how I’m def chaotic neutral bc I love being chaotic	There I could be a sociologist You're chaotic good lol Not neutral
mmmm eh maybe what’re you	True neutral lol Keep getting those on tests
wowowow	Idk I thought I wouldn't be But it just
ooh I actually haven’t taken a test in a while I just guessed lmao	Happened
mmm I see it tho	Oh yeah this is from my judgement when we did a charting for our froct Quad + quad
oh yea!	:p
	Also I've come to terms with the fact that I'm a slytherin
omg I still don’t see that	I'm gonna start liking the color green
you a raven claw in my eyes ok	And black But I'm not going to be emo Lolll
black yes green no?? idk green is not my thing	Lol

okii	heyo
hi hi ready to call?	yee
 The video chat ended.	 The video chat ended.
Omg I just read it	Haha What do u think
I actually think Ive read this long ago huhhh but ahhh idk like it’s so awful, what the child goes through	Yeah
and I can’t imagine ever accepting it But also	I found it when I was tutoring ela last year
like their reasoning somewhat does make sense in a horrible horrible way?	Or was it not that Maybe it was lit Eah
maybe lit? like i dunno the tradeoff? is it truly necessary? or can there be that kind of ultimate happiness without an immeasurable amount of pain?	8 think in any society probably
mmm Heyo! Once school/finals are done, would u be down to work on some kind of project together!	Yeah I'm down Any ideas in mind?
not quite but we can brainstorm!!	ok i'm down
okiii	do you think humans are closer to demons or angels
oooh interesting question tbh I think it depends? I think it’s a spectrum and I think diff people are closer to different ends as a whole race tho I think I might go with demons? Just because of how I define the way they operate, as in I think humans and demons both often act upon their own desires vs I feel like angels perhaps act for a higher purpose?	Yeah word ok I read smth on tumblr just now that was like Angels are cold And demons have heartbeats And I was like seems legit
ooooh huh	Cuz angels always do what is morally considered right without regard for context or emotion
very interesting That’s true	So they could be considered cold
mmhm	Lol I just thought of it That's all
and I feel like demons are full of emotions, albeit maybe not desirable ones but in a way they exhibit what humans regard as being full of “life”?	Yes true Demons have much better character development in stories than angels Like hush hush was about fallen angels I think u and I should get into philosophy Like modern day philosophy And then we can write or talk about it too For whatever project we do this summer I think we can either do like 2 one more humanities and personal development focused and one more technical reach the limits of our capacities Or we can go big and try to find a project that does both But that's usually hard
oooh yes!! Actually I’m taking a bioethics class rn	Ooooh that's eight right
Yeaaa maybe I’ll take away something interesting from it we’ll see haha	Low-key what do u feel about going into the healthcare industry
but yes!! I’m excited hmmm	Not like med school bit like
idt *idk	Healthcare industry consulting or tech related work Things like that
I think I’d be pretty interested?	thiis is actually unrelated to covid
not as much as I thought before tho maybe	i just thought of it since we did hosa for a while
like the reason I took the engineering development class I took this sem - a biotech one - was bc I thought I’d like it but I think it’s just that I like a very niche part of bio stuff	oh ok yeah makes sense lol
healthcare is more interesting tho and I think consulting related to it would be cool like consulting for a healthcare-tech company?? Would be p ideal	oh hmm i see strangely i feel a little detached from the healthcare industry these days like i've been actively trying to avoid doing work in those fields because i feel like my whole expereince has become saturated with it
huh interestingg Oh right bc you also did research related to it right? ig makes sense to explore things beyond it?	yeah like most of my research work is related to healthcare in one way or another and like it's so weird i keep trying to escape it but it keeps coming back like i thought my current urop would be unrelated to healthcare but still ML so i took it on but it turns out i'm still doing healthcare computer vision work lol
damn omg ok Let’s do smth non healthcare related then!	LOL ok thanks for your consideration
	is there an easy way to make that emoji using like
I wanna do smth that like actually matters to us in some way	emoticon characters yeah i don't really vibe with a lot of the repetitive work that's being done around covid these days tbh
uhhhh idt so yeaaa	like i want something big impact + unique and not niche industry
Oh yea I really don’t wanna do smth cocos related	because niche industries always end up being underused or just like nott as useful
oh yea wait I’m featured on Zoe’s podcast now!! *covid Yeaaa	i saw lol i listened to part of it earlier today am hosed atm tho
!! What’d you think haha	just taking a brief break cuz i have a meeting at 10 i feel like i recognized a lot of the stuff you talked about from before when we talked ok honestly i feel like almost intruding when i listen to zoe's podcast so for people i don't know well i don't want to listen because i feel like i don't deserve to hear it yet and for people i do know i either am familiar with it or can be even more uncomfortable bc i've never heard it directly from you before
Huhhh that’s an interesting perspective I feel like I disagree on the intrusive part bc they chose to share it on a public forum? And I think part of that is because they have a message they want people to hear I do get the uncomfortable thing tho bc yea esp for some of them I’m like I can’t even imagine this	yeah i totally get that it's like a me thing lol
mmm yea	lol i feel like a subpar person
omg no ur not!	Lol Like I mean I feel like I don't function at normal human leveks
mmmmm wdym?	I just feel like I don't enjoy the intracacies of being human ad much as I should
huhhh that’s an interesting thought I feel like I think about them a lot more than normal ppl idk if there really is a should tho? everyone kind of embraces different aspects of it and to different levels	Lol well Not as much as I want
Hmm ://	It's all good This isn't one of my crises
omg okok that’s good at least!!	LOL wow look at me a whole mess
nahhhhh	yahhhh
"omg dude this is so bad so the project we're currently doing is this like zombie apocalypse ok and everyone else has a variable called ""alive"" to keep track of whether they're still alive after each round of zombie attacks and then there's me, who called my variable ""died""...."	LOL Well let's Hope died is false
nahh I think I die in most cases LOL There’s just too many zombies but on a side note my output almost looks right so!!	Hi wow that sounds so cool
ahah debugging is worse than zombies eating my brain tho smh how go the finals?	Ahahah so it goes I did like 1.5 today 2 more
oooh gl gl!!! love the .5	One of them wasn't really afinal
Random note but you know I’m seriously getting addicted to best dressed when I think the way I’m styling my pj’s is cute	what's best dressed
It’s this YouTube channel!! she does like thrift store diys and style stuff?	wait is this the british thing lol but you were also always into fashion so this isn't surprising in any way
omg lolol no it’s not British, that’s say yes to the dress but yeaaa tbh I wanna go thrifting	OH lol dude i get all your shows so mixed up damn i would only go thrifting if it was with you cuz you'd make it fun <3
LOL I have to many addictions dude awww omg yay let’s do it!!! it’ll be super fun	agreed i want to go to europe omg just like a chill college trip i want to vlog about it too i thought your vlog to new york and boston was excellent it felt like a real vlog amy should post it
Omg wait let’s do it Backpacking in Europe Omg yes, all the credit goes to Amy ofc ahah ugh I wantttt I also wanna wear all these cute outfits bc I have so many statement pants and I think they would be super cute paired w just a bralette  but like I can’t wear just that on campus ...	ugh so down sometimes i just wanna have all the time int eh world so instead of trying to hit all the tourist attrctions i just pretend to live like a european for a week in the city and like that's it
wait yes	lol omg that wasn't what i was htinking when i said college trip but sure
I had this idea that like when I’m a lil older I’ll take a month off every year and just go live in some super cool place for the month In like an Airbnb and explore the actual city hehe ik but I was Dude yea and like go to the legit local places and shit that doesn’t happen with my parents, which is sad, so	how could u have the vacation days same lol but like to be fair if you're only there for a short time u do want to capture the most award winning moments so i'm ok with it but like if i had more time i'd like to explore more my mom said the same too
ummmm I will uh Be running my own business?? Idkkk lol dreams man Yeaaa ik like you can’t say you went there and not see certain things Which is why you need more time idk I mean our Italy trip was kinda back and forth, sometimes we ended up at super authentic cool places and sometimes it was just so touristy I was like	dude ain't no startup founder get vacation days they on the grind 24/7
Maybe maybe my start up would be related to travel ?? lol I’m just fishing here	i can almost imagine ah a warm italian sun shines down on my face i have no finals i have no worries i am completely free someone pay me to travel lol hire me
Yessss LOL we can pay each other let’s make traveling our job dude ahhhhh done this week right?	with what moneyyyyy done by thursday
Details, details	i knew u would say smth like this
ooh yay!! hehe done right before your birthday :) you can party it upppp	yeha facts lol same as last year lol hopefully next year it works out right oto
yee yee you got any plans !	for the weekend? aw hell nah imma just bake myself a cake i think my mom will make some good food i'm sure she's always been the celebratory type i'm really good at baking cakes with cake mix now tho we have two more boxes of it so it'll be chill
self sufficient I see you ooh omg!	u know it
make me me some somedayyyy	i'm down i baked and frosted one for mother's day and it was *chef's kiss
oooh!!	superb
Send pics!!	i don't have them on my phone but my mom has i'll obtain later anyways the frosting is much harder than it looks i always thought it was way easier from all the videos i was watching
Dude ikr!! I haven’t made a boxed cake in a couple years but I remember I always majorly screwed it up but ooh!! Profession chef jams to the rescue haha I made spicy hash browns today, they were actually p good	reallly not lol all i do is follow the recipe
except too spicy for me so my dad ate most fo them	ugh that sounds amazing
That is hard for peasants like me !	i could relaly go for some hash browns nah you got the creativity i only have like
actually j have gotten a bit better at cooking in general lolol	random bursts of wanting to make things
ahhh me too homeostasis	so i just know how to make like 5 random things
Honestly*	with no relation
LOL	to each other
5 course meal baby	wait this is not even a joke it's like kimchi fried rice boba balls chocolate chip cookies / fake snickerdoodles aka sugar cookies dalgona coffee uh what else like ramen that's it like where is te relation
I mean you def are like able to learn new things tho!! and all of those are Tasty	LOL nah i don't like cooking i just like eating but when i can't buy the thing i have to make it myself so that's where it comes from
literally same omg	LOL
I think I’ll stop cooking after quarantine bc I’ll just buy it except mug cakes I think I’ve perfected my mug cake	eek same my mom and i are keeping a list of places we want to go eat after the death of corona how do u make mug cakes like less solid whenever i made them they ended up too much like 1 large sponge
omg take me with youuu huhhh omg well mine used to actually be too crumbly but the recipe I currently do is	my friend jianna has been making a lot of mug cakes too lol
3 tb all purpose flour, 2 tb sugar, 2 tb cocoa powder, 1/4 ok wait why tf am I typing this out but woah I actually memorized it I think I used to make it for too long? now I do 46 seconds it’s perfectttt	WOWOWO you must make it a lot can i substitute hot cocoa powder for hot chocolate for the cocoa cuz we don't own coca i think i'll just remove the sugar from your recipe then wait finish your recipe tho
ohhh huh wait maybe you can look up a specific recipe for that tho? I’m not sure if hot cocoa has diff properties Hehe ok ¼ tsp baking powder, 3 tbs milk, 1 tbs oil, a drop of vanilla extract and add ons I do sometimes are chocolate chips, cinnamon powder, and instant coffee powder	ooh nice ok yeah i think the egg was making it spongy yours sounds fantastic i think i'm just gonna eyeballl it and remove the sugar and replace it with double the cocoa see this is why i can't be a chef too i get lazy and eyeball a bunch of stuff based on a gut feeling i don't have
omg wait I started doing that w my pasta sauce now, I just taste it every few min ooh ok lmk how it goes!! it’s funny I think my mom actually getsmad at me for following recipes too closely, she’s like meh just do whatever	wowow pasta conoisseur did i spell that right oh really lol my mom is opposite? if there's a recipe whenever she makes her normal dinner dishes tho it's just like whatever she wants
LOL I think?? it’s super easy, you should try making bechemel sauce and ooooh eheh see I think the problem is my mom only cooks her normal dishes smh I’m the Experimenter of the household 	ooohooo big girl i see you it's very exciting what u make tho innovation design! creativity!

Ahahah after my exam I just could not sit at my laptop anymore so I was like I’ll be productive	imagine all the teachers who had to listen to you play that awful instrument too oh how'd that go

I haven’t checked it out recently but yay!!! im so happy for her	just anything u want
Dude	i want to read one of your stories just saw some instagram stories of people she's interviewed i'm totally out of good material to read
I found a notebook that I wrote like responses to prompts in for fun? Like from 2017 it’s sooo cringe	besides tumblr feeds can only be refreshed so much
And angsts	what prompts lol be like that sometimes i'm considering just kicking myself off tumblr
True that :// omg okok	lol write something interesting
I never finish them thoooi	i literally don't know what YA novels to read anymore
Like I build a world	i'll bug u to update until u do
And make characters and then it stops omg no I like can’t even write a single chapter smh	i'm totally opposite lol like i'll imagine one scene
Dude!! You should update your tumblr story	and then i'm like
It was so good	ok i'm going to write a total book about this one scene and fill in teh blanks as i go plotholes everywhere nothing makes sense lol i thought about it
I think it was some kind of 365 prompt challenge thing?? I literally did 4 SMH	but it's so long ago so if i were to write anything i'd start over
oooh	with a similar world but better take on it
I can’t write like that omg I like need to know where it’s going	oh shoot that's cool we should do one of those advent calendars i read in the three body problem
oooh yes yes I approve	well technically its the sequel but anyways they said that writing is like bringing your characters to life and after a while the author is just like observing their actions
Yeaa for sure, like it writes itself ig??	and they decide what to do based on the character you've made for them sometimes lol sometimes it's just like what is this character this no comprendo
I’m also a big world building kinda gal tho, and with that you can also just make up a world and write a bunch of snippets of story in it and then it all comes together? LOL omg what if we’re characters in a book Then the author is def saying that about me	ugh that's nice saying what LOL sometimes i think if my life were a movie or someone was observing my every move that would be so awful i would die of embarassment
“this no comprendo” Woahhhhb	LOL rip
wait dude we watched a movie like that In an English class?? Middle or high school idk but it was like, the guy finds out he’s actually like a character in a book and freaks out?? wait there was also another one where it’s like a 24/7 tv show starring this dude and then he finds out his life is like being broadcast to a bunch of ppl or smth	kdrama W except lee jong suk was just always cool aw shit black mirror
oh yea there’s W but these are two like American movies? I don’t remember tho ugh oooh omg the only episode I ever saw of that is the do it yourself one?? And idt we even finished bc we got so confused smh	oh really? i don't remember that episode i used to be sort of into it lmk if u do lol

mehhh but Something to start with	yeah i suppose i'm not sure like i want to do some stuff but i'm trying to make sure i'm not just getting myself caught up in all these bureaucratic things or just too many processes
hmmmm okay That makes sense, but ig sometimes you need to deal with a little of it to get started? idkkk radio show would b cool tho, makes me think of johnny and jaehyun’s haha	Haha okok maybe
woah omg dudr apparently stay at home order is over??!	Huh? My dad said it was until June 12
That’s what I thought too but look it up, I think there’s smth new today says if it’s outdoors, gatherings of up to 100 are permitted? and restaurants at limited capacity can do in-person I think stuff like barber shops and theatres are still closed tho	Oh reaLly? Are u gonna go then
lolol nah, I feel like I normally don’t have anywhere to go anyways I do wanna get takeout from kungfu tho!	That would be lit I thought they're closed tho

On what	but on my website for context
yay!!!	i have been trying to actually learn web dev for like a while and even though i officially started my urop this week i decided it would be the perfect time to learn react so idk how this is gonna work out be safe
oooh wait that’s actually really dope It is the perfect time to learn!! oh how is it now that it’s official also This is the first time in ages I’m trying to actively follow the news and I hate how sad it is but like change is also so necessary? but I also hate doing stuff on social media and so I like don’t but I posted something on my story for the first time and now I’m like idk, uncomfortableee but I shouldn’t be?? But idk if what I’m saying is even right or if it even matters and like what can I do other than sign petitions and possibly donate and read articles sorry for the rant	i'll show u once it's up haha uh i just told my summer urop that i still had to finish up my spring urop last week which was true and then i didn't even end up fulling finishing it last week so now i just have two things yeah this is like one of my biggest problems with like social media activism like it seems somehow sort of backwards and almost like counterproductive sometimes
Yeaaa But then it’s like the one thing I posted all week is about how ppl should not be posting black screens and what they can do instead? which I do believe but like	yeah i feel you
I just have this irrational fear it’ll be taken wrongly ig?	you can also send emails to the mineeapolis police
yeah	so i guess even a little bit helps i feel like
I should	very useless but it's not like i did much before sorry nothing sent in order my wifi keeps cutting out
ugh I’m scared of everything smh but facing my fears?? Yeaaa :// awww omg you can get the summer one done quick I’m sure!!! and then you’ll b more free?	lol definitely not it's like supposed to go the whole summer yeah i think a big part of it is like i want to make sure i'm giving informed advice and opinions but like just do it you know
yeahhhh omg oops I meant the spring one so that you’ll only have one you need to work on yea exactly I don’t wanna spread harmful stuff, bc even accidentally that’s so bad	oh yeah i'm not sure i'm kind of stuck but the guy hasn't emailed me back yet so i'm just gonna pretend like it doesn't exist
LOL ye ye until he emails	lmao how was your day today video call 8pm tmrw?
haha p nonexistent, I woke up for lecture but then I just napped until like 5 pm I really need to start on my project sure that should work!! maybe a lil later if that’s ok bc I usually eat dinner around that time oh but also I spent last night watching Eric Nam’s podcast videos on YouTube!!! I forgot how funny he was omg	sure sure i told dongha i'd call him since he's leaving soon he has a podcast?
oooh omg bet the three of us haven’t called in a hot sec And yes!! look up dive studios on YouTube he has stuff, the girl Jimin from ASC also has stuff on it, and I think jay does too?	Ope I've got smth until 10 shall we do then or sometime during the day then Oh I only remember jimin park had a podcast But that's really cool Also the guy responded So I probably need to do smth jamiefu.me It's up It looks kind of wonky still on mobile But lmk

dude I’m always down to call at night like esp after midnight, catch me any day crying over my code that is LOL	oh man that's so sad lol
wait wait im actually making progress rn this is great	on your code???? yayyy
Yesyes loll I was mainly just procrastinating for days I mean probably not right but it’s written	that's good that's the first step
yesss	hi can you read something for me before i post it
ooh yea sure, send it over!	"I've been seeing a lot of content on social media lately that either consciously or unconsciously attacks other activists for ""doing it wrong"" or ""not doing enough"". While I recognize that performative activism is prevasive, what I hope to remind everyone is that we're not perfect human beings. We don't always know the best thing to do, or the best action to take, or the best way to help. The majority of us, including myself, are still learning how to be better activists, participants, and people, and I think that it is counterproductive to turn yourself against someone who is trying to help. Whether or not someone expresses their viewpoint on social media ten times a day or doesn't post at all should not be an indicator of how much they are doing outside of this environment. Furthermore, if you see something spreads the wrong information, or see someone engage in behavior that could be negative, don't assume that they don't care enough or don't want to help. Instead, reach out and communicate with them about the issue and discuss together what you think the right course of action is. The goal of media during this time is to educate and provide resources for a wider audience, not to sow dissent among those who are trying to help. Change is incurred by the masses, and there's no use in being better at activism than someone else. We should all want to ""do better"". ok i really wanted to post this earlier but now i'm not so sure i'm kind of nervous lol bc i don't know if it's right either"
I like it one grammatical thing - near the beginning of Furthermore...”something that” You forgot the that I think	oh yeah i did
But I really like the message	thanks for the catch LOL i wasn't nervous but ALL OF A SUDDEN i'm so nervous
I think it’s something that’s really needed to be said and you do it in a really artful way ahhh I know, I’m scared in general  to post things to but it’s what you believe and it’s well-said	omg ok i'm gonna do it
and don’t be scared of backlash or what ppl might think	wait i'm totally scared of that omg f i did it ok i need to get off fb immediately
awww ikik it’s okay though also tho tbh not to be negative but so many ppl are posting things these days so it’s very possible not many ppl will even see it though	it's on fb so hopefully it reaches my network at least but yeah i've been seeing a lot of stuff on ig LOL this is such a stupid problem to have i hate getting into arguments
omg sameee like I despise confrontation Yeah which I definitely understand it’s just like imo all the posts abt unfriend me if you don’t believe this you shouldn’t be putting out more hate and making them leave?? I feel like you should reach out to those kind of people more and educate them and stuff	yeah i just like feel really uncomfortable reading that because i feel like it pushes away those who try to help but maybe don't do a great job of it at first
Yeahhh oh yea wait what time today are we calling again? 10?	i think so?
okii i think wer're doing like a birthday video call for a friend at 11:45 so if we're still calling then ill quickly hop off and back on :)	OOH exciting who's it for
Raina! From my apex analyst class	woah you had a class?? oh u mean like class of 2020
oh hah yeee like freshman but also it’s like each semester is considered an analyst class? so call analyst class was 6 of us, and I think winter had 8 ppl?	ohhhh damn u go girl ok
LOL um So Erin and I had been talking ab hanging out at a park in Farmington tmrw do smth but I think we might go to a protest instead and I am very terrified and also like not gonna tell my parents so ahhhh is this a good idea??	oh nice yeah uh are u worried about corona i can't go cuz like high risk people in the house so but i'd really want to witness one
ohhh yea :// um actually no, which is maybe bad but i dont care too much abt corona? like its a peaceful protest but im just irrationally worried about like it becoming violent or getting arrested or smth	lol what
also bc im not telling my parents right so im terrified if something happens ill get in like super trouble? okok that came off bad, its just with my mom like going to work like normal this whole time, im less concerned abt it causing an issue in my family	hmm i see your point oh i see
bc i feel like she was already in a high-risk situation but yeaaa this is so strange but exciting but scary	yeah that's valid but bail funds yanno i'll bail u out if u get arrested
awwww	make sure u wear a mask
ty ty yes ofc and will wear non-descript clothing and uh apparently on this post abt protests, they said like turn your phone off which is smth im like slightly worried abt?	which protest r u going to
oops sorry idk how I missed that but ye, also there’s one in Novi on sat?? It’s like at the library so I feel like can def go to that one	oh how did u hear about this west bloomfield isn't far tho oh wow yeah i kind of feel strange about protests tho protests need to get coverage and audiences
erin sent it to me! Idk where she heard it from yea it’s like right by Farmington so ig I’m telling like kinda close to the truth eheh mmmm yeah like the more people that go, the more impactful I hope a lot of people do? And that one I think I may also go to we’ll see	LOL yeah media coverage would be nice
yeahhh I wonder how many ppl would go in Novi	I'm not sure eifher
omg so I made pasta for lunch and like I crushed garlic for it right my hands still smell like garlic	Haha that sounds so fancy tbo T.T
ahhh it’s literally just butter garlic flour milk cheese? plus like salt and pepper haha	wow you're so into cooking i love it
Lolol dude no it’s literally the one dish I can make	that's fine that's so fun do u have any recommendations for things i should make
bechemel sauce!! With pasta !! aka only thing I can make	:oo
but hmmm I think homemade ice cream is pretty doable? And is nice when it’s so hot	what is bechemel sauce so much whipping cream
it’s a type of white sauce, look it up! Or like Make cheesecake mini cheesecakes	so much cream cheese LOL
bruh	ok i'm messing w u what is some like
ikik	actual food tho
uhhhh ooh wait I feel like pasta salad could be cool bc it’s like cold right I can’t think of hot food rn I’m literally dying	LOL every time i bake it's just too much
ahhhh make Smaller quantities !! nah I always just end up eating everything tho	oh yeah i should honestly get better at that
yeaaa ooh nice hackmit thing! update on the protest: it was quite nice actually, and v v peaceful haha	Thanks jack actually texted me the same day I was about to ask him if we should post Oh that's very good How'd it go
at first it was standing + chanting(?) near like an intersection and cars honked as they drove down which was interesting and then we walked to the police station with signs and stuff and the leader of the group talked, and then the police chief also talked?	Dang nice the police chief also talked?
yeaaa it was very very hot tho I tanned so much in one day smh But yea overall good experience I’d say!	Aye that's good I'm not sure I would be good at protesting but Id want to go see one to learn
mmmm yeah, like I’m not one for shouting/chanting stuff loudly but like I think it really depends on who you go with also I have a proposal for you!	Yeah what's up
since Dongha is leaving so soon and I thought its sad if you didn’t get to see him in person for indefinite amt of time, what’re your thoughts on us driving to your house and saying hi/talking from the car out on ur drive way or smth the way my mum and I did for your bday	Aw that'd be so cute I'm asking my mom now Yeah I think I can when should we do this She says I have to wear a mask tho lol
haha that’s fine we will too	What day is he moving
uhhh ok wait let’s ask	Lol I mean u don't need to its just my mom
nahh issok tho I wore a mask basically all day today and my face sweat soooo much it was gross also wait what’re ur mom’s thoughts on getting food? like if I brought boba for all of us?	:(( she said no
ahhh okok	U should just bring it tho for u and dongha It's fine they're just overly cautious
awww that’d be sad for u tho	I trust u kids don't have corona
Nono I mean it makes sense	No it's totally not lol dw U should bring it
I mean I did go out today in like a crowd ...p	Oh yeah lol Well
Maybe I’ll just get it for him as a parting gift LOL	I HOPE u don't have corona
yea no I’ll socially distance and wear a mask and stuff	We should get him something that reminds him of novi
LOL I really don’t think so dw oooh like what	Idk
wait let’s actually get him something omg I can make a card	That's what I'm thinking of I'll get him a potato And break it
LMFAO P bet let’s do it	LOL
Ooooh wait I can make like a picture thing? if we combine all the pics we have with/of him that would be cute	Oii That would be
I actually have the perfect thing to put it on too I think, lemme check I bought smth a while back	I also want to get him smth that he might use in his daily life We can buy something nice together and I'll do two day shipping I'll look on amazon
oooh omg yes lets do it We can call and shop !!	OK I'm down Do u wanna todah since we should probably decide soon
yesyes Gimme like ~5-10 and I can call	ok sure omg i have to eat dinner rn uhhhhhh i have meetings from 8-10pm tn but i'm going to look during them since the meetings prob won't have to do with me and then we can call later tn or around midnight when my parents are not bothering me anymore
oki a lil after midnight should be good? I’m calling someone at 11 I think	busy  busy ok down
is ~12:40ish ok	Yeah Works for me

You missed a video chat with Saranya. The video chat ended. wait should we get smth in addition to the keychains	Sure what r u thinking og
I don’t know	Rip uhhhh
welppp if I think of anything will lyk?? also wait huh Anjali says she thinks dwip lied abt getting into Stanford🤔	Lol really? He told me before results came out that he preferred Princeton tho I really can't understand why people lie about these things tho so
yea like what is the benefit of doing that	Yeah so idk
idk, she was saying - like she knew him really well right? And she said that Stanford had always been his dream school	Oh really? He applied early to Princeton tho He told me Princeton + Stanford were his top choices
and when she saw that he accepted she asked him abt it, and that his reasons were vague/weird? And that she asked someone who’s in the Stanford fb group to see and he never joined for smth? ohhh huh yea lol i wonder	Ohhh Weird But
I also don’t really care LOL but it’s just kinda odd ig	Idk I don't wanna get into it Lol Yeah I was thinking that Not my business
Yeahhhh exactly on a totally different note ! my mom and I are painting our garage !!	Yayyyyy What color
grey!! We’re just doing primer for today so looks more white so	ohhh why did u decide to do grey
tbh I have no idea my mom just went and bought paint one day and was like we’re painting the garage	LOL damn that's motivation my room STILL has unpacked clothes just like piles of clothes i haven't put in drawers
.... omg how is it possible that I’m more organized than you??	LOL
I mean my rooms a mess but my clothes are in the closet..!!	U almost guilted me into cleaning The other day But I resisted
.... SMH Ok no I will guilt you into cleaning again	LOL Yeah idk man
I still need to finish my room so I’ll call u then; and you can clean your room too!! hi I’m bored	dammit wait let me redo this hi bored i'm frustrated
hi frustrated, what’s making you feel that way?	LOL uh so somebody in my lab implemented the network that i was supposed to work on which i was under the assumption that she was going to not get to for a while + not do exactly the same thing i was trying to do so now i'm trying to get my version to work
huhh thats odd - they did a part you were supposed to do? but ahhh you got this!! good luck good luck	like yeah i'm not really sure why ig she's eally interested but like whatever i'm over it
okayyy	YOOOOOO is it fun i love painting
ahhh yesyes fun but tiringgg	does the paint smell yeah i bet
yeaaa I kinda like it tho LOL And ig it helps that it’s the garage bc we just keep the garage door open while we work	oh yeah venting it is good aren't there like carcinogens in paint fumes or smth like that lowkey campfire smoke
ohh huh yea I’ve def heard of that ooooh dude I really wanna have a campfire that would be so dope and like make s’mores and stuff ahhh	yeah that's why you're not supposed to stick your head into fume hoods i love campfires
I’ve only ever been to a few🥺 we should have one like a bonfire ahhh yea that makes sense oh also why like spray painting stuff indoors would be an awful idea LOL	Yeahhhhh
making cookiesss	Omg Im jelly
ahhh they didn’t turn out quite amazing in terms of shape but still taste p good!	Wowowowiw I haven't made cookies in a while
oooh u should make some	What kind hmm I tried chocolate chip twice And sugar cookie once

omg my parents are letting me cook dinner!! imma make a roasted cauliflower pasta? With lemon and garlic	Ooooh very fancy
I think it turned out p ok?	Oh wow that's so aesthetic How did it taste
It was pretty good!! I think next time wanna add more vegetables and need a bit more seasoning?	What's the seasoning u used this time
uhhh let’s see salt pepper garlic lemon zest and crushed red pepper flakes?	Oh wowww
oh we didn’t have olive oil so used canola oil instead so that could also make a diff	Hmm maybe
lmao I think my dad just wanted more spices	Very nice tho
tyyy	You could make an Italian Indian hybrid
oooh yeah that would be cool I actually saw a pretty interesting recipe for an Indian spiced vegetarian shepherds pie?? might try that next time also ok so should I pick you up ~2 tomorrow?	Yep
Oh I think Dongha said to come after 3; I’ll pick you up around 2:20ish still maybe tho so we can have time to get whatever it is ready!	ok sure

oookh lmaoo but you don’t like coffee?? Or do you?? Wait I’d actually be down to get an expression machine but I think they’re quite expensive smh	I don't like the headaches it gives me In general I don't love it But these days I like it better
Oooh yes you make really pretty coffee eheh you should make me some :))	Haha I'm down
yeet we should also hang out again!! Now that you’re allowed in my car ??	haha idk if it was a one time thing hopefully not but i'm down
hiya are u free to call later idk if you remember but this guy in my class wrote a book and I need to read + write a review for it and I haven’t done it yet oops would you be down to read it with me lol	oh yeah what kinda book is it i'm done after 9pm today
I’m not sure tbh, I might take a quick look now + make a copy of the doc and share that with you? seemed interesting when I glanced at it a while back tho!! P	sureee i'm down
oki just shared a copy with you!	aye 
The video chat ended. okok I asked him abt u reading it and he said of course so I can just have both our comments on it and share yayyy	heyyyyyy ayeeeeee anyways i'm back
yay!! sent an attachment.  The video chat ended. omg i hate the ending of this it becomes like a weird dystopian thing??? idk wtf is going on smhhhh I finally sent it back to him holyyyyyy I worked almost 8 hrs on that????	oh wow that's not bueno why did u put so much work into it
ugh ikr that’s like The most productive I’ve been but honestly wait imo the ending was so shit, it was like one of those future things where the government controls everything?? and there’s constant outbreaks of viruses so they’re always quarantining and socially distanced; and they have these Fertility Balls to meet the person they’ll marry, and the government decides if it’s a good match And by “government” I mean the world is run by a conglomerate of Facebook, google, and social media stuff???	LOL Strange I worked for like 3 hours to get this The inside is not as soft as last time tho rip wait i can't remember if i told u but we said we'd go visit dongha right well what if we just went later this summer after he's done moving and settled in
This looks so good holy omg wait that would be super dope I really dont think my parents would say yes tho, def it I gave that reason?? hmmm even if it’s just like a trip w to more *korea; I feel like the Korea part + international + covid is like if I can convince them tho for sure!!!	korea has it most under control rn but yeah i suppose my parents would be nervous about it too
I feel like the biggest thing is just me going internationally lmao, like they barley even let me go to New York I feel and didn’t let me go to Toronto?? Which is closer?? gahhh	oh what's wrong with international travel
unsure?? wait is it better to lowkey bring it up now and like slowly butter them up to the idea	lol yes good idea i brought it up with my mom cuz i mentioned dongha was moving and said i wanted to visit him at some point
L both my parents already said no for even traveling in 2020 they’re like “you already travelled once during covid, isn’t that enough”	uh won't u have to go back to school at some point tho
lol ye but it’s not exactly traveling to go 40 min away?	i mean you'll be around way more people and public spaces
also I’m making a hard stand that once I go to campus I’m not coming back until it ends	with students who don't really care about their hygience
yeaaa ik it’s quite unreasonable maybe I can ask again after a while tho, and if things get better??	:(( sad my parents aren't all for it but they didn't shoot me down yet i told them that anna sun recently went to cali on a plane and that delta did a really good job with the hygiene
oooh	and separated passengers by rows and gave them a care kit that's what reminded me of telling them that dongha was moving
like yea I mean my brothers coming from Cali on a plane so	precisely
ugh dude my parents are just so sexist tho like my mom is literally against me getting even kayaking?? Which I’ve done before? and these days she keeps saying she wants me married by 24 like SFC *wtf	wait what does that part have to do with sexism oh that's early
mmhmmm oh just like I’m never allowed to go anywhere/do anything even if my brother did it at the same age? which tbh I need to start just doing stuff and maybe telling instead of asking - if only I was earning money LOL But anyways yes hopefully this trip can happen some point soon?? Christmas break might be a better bet than end of summer but idk	that's when germs tho
ohhhh you right ooof okok we will see *hopefully*	haha yes *hopefully*
on a side note, I’m trying to learn how to play the harmonica! ooh also on another side note tho, how much would a plane ticket cost maybe I can start saving up in the sense that every time I wanna go buy something, I’ll instead set that amount aside for a trip	Idk yeah I figure theyd be cheaper rn
mmm true that	Oh i forgot to respond to the other messages That is great What are learninf
oh lol you're good! ahhh its um very slow i havent been able to figure out how to play all the notes smh	Aye that's alright if it helps I've given up on my guitar
awww no why!	I just don't practice anymore lol I forgot about it Besides I'm not really getting better So it's sad Every time I practice
mmm maybe you'll pick them up again later?? awww nono you will def improve or eheh you could pick up a harmonica too and we can do a harmonica duet	I don't own tho LOL That would be interestinf Perhaps
LOL yeah no i randomly found it in my roomw hen i cleaned	Oof I still need to do that Thanks for the reminder Maube I'll get to it fr

hmm ok maybe he can come at same time? Like coming back from hs you could bring him here and then he can leave whenever I guess also wait I should prob wear pants right ughh it’s so hot	Why do I have to bring himmmmmmmm
Bc It’s my house So I should be home first!	FINEEEEE Also Be at hs by 45 to set up I'm gonna head out now cux construction an rush hour
Oh shoot ok I might be a lil late hold on	Come in through the side door by auditorium main entrance
Ok	Did they send you your new license already The horizontal one
Isn’t that one like when you’re 21 they did send me new one after I turned 18	Oh
But it’s still vertical	Really? They still haven't sent me one yet
Huhhhh maybe ask?	What does it look like?
I wasn’t expecting to be sent it It actually came in just a few days before I turned 18 Uhhh literally the same tbh	Bruhhh Wait nothing is different? Boiiii What is going on
wait which walkie talkie do you have? I have yours by accident	hey shirlyn where can i find the sso key for quill it got redeployed right
wait you mean ssh key? what do you need to do	no the sso key i need it for quill so i can do the login from spectacle
make a new one/ ?	wait what does that mean where should i do that lol
isn't it linked to your account	the sso key? wait i thought it was for quill in general wait i gtg rn but i'll explain more in a bit tyty
ok you should prob ask jack he wrote the sso	ah ok thanks hey shirlyn do u have any time in next week to help set up the quill sso stuff for spectacle i'm gone over the weekend unfortunately but like evenings i'm mostly free
on the quill side or spectacle side	So in the config file that Jason set up there was like a quill sso token or smth like that and I think that's all we need for it to work properly But I'm not exactly sure how it works Do u know maybe what I'm talking about
oh yeah that's basically just a random string you come up with i think but i need to configure it on the quill side too	Oh okay I see Is there anything I should do on my end then
nah I'll lyk once i have it merged	ok awesome thanks shirlyn how's the quill sso thing coming along
omg sorry I totally forgot with the quill confirmation fiasco but i can get it working tonight	yeah lmao no worries
where are you hosting your thing i need to whitelist the url	the db? i actually have no clue like the website in general let me ask justin
website in general might not be functional yet tho	I mean we're just running it locally rn so idrk what to do Does it make sense for localhost5000 to be whitelisted I mean back when it was still the hack quill the SSO seemed to work
not the same quill the code is completely different not completely but i might've added bugs to it	Oh the rewrite?
nah it's just that the code doesn't stay between each implementation for some rly dumb reason anyways i'll check what needs to be whitelisted	Okay thanks shirlyn
huh i think you might be able to try localhost because it mostly cares about the redirect url lemme add it added, if you wanna add anything else feel free to log into quill	"Oh okay awesome thanks so much I just got in bed but I'll try it tmrw! hey shirlyn this is the url spectacle is openingon login click:   handleLogin() {
    window.location.href = ""
  } is the /api/auth/login url the one that's supposed to be whitelisted i don't have an account on this quill bp deploymennt but i can't sign in with the admin account either like the login button is just unresponsive on the quill login pop up app.js? [sm]:28699 TypeError: $ is not a function

ok that's not good I'll take a look when i get back	sg!
IT IS WORKING	WAIT WHAT amazing wait i just tried to do it though am getting 404 error
try Firefox or chrome incognito	ok omg amazing it works it redirects to login/success that should redirect to root url tho right wait i think this might be a problem on our end but when i go back to root the login button appears again when i hit it though it automatically signs in huh is the token not getting stored somewhere
the token should be passed back as an argument in the url you need to validate it check the pull request	ok i think it's processing the token fine but the home page just isn't checking if there's a user value now i'm not sure huh that's fine i'll look at it tmrw thanks so much shirlyn
yee lmk if you need anything else	yee kat's snack is takis
oh boy hmart trek	ahah aren't there any in verdes
I don't remember seeing them but I'll double check wait rip i'm so sorry i don't think i have time to go to hmart tomorrow	lmao can u find someone else mayb if not i'll ask around
kk i think my friend's going tomorrow	ok great your assassins target is kat - check go/assassins for the rules, starts tonight at 12am text me/jack if you have any contested kills, but otherwise if you kill someone just have them pass on their target to you Moved my flight to tmrw
same rip lmao	What time shirlyn michael is getting a 500 error on login
logging into quill?	yeah from spectacle i gave him the same config file i've been using i'm about to try it on my machine
oh wait check which port he's using  this is what's whitelisted	yeah i just realized that might be the problem too i'm asking him now ok it works on my machine he says he's on 5000 tho hmm i'll continue to debug with him and let u know
aight lmk if i can help	do you know if users already have to be logged in for the redirect to work
it should take you to a login page if you aren't already logged in	it takes him to the login page then immediately redirects to the 500 error
did he try on diff browsers or incognito	so he actually was already logged in and his account had existed for a while he said
so it fails on other browsers too?	he's using chrome i just asked him to try another lol
still broken?	Perhaps So it sort of works It only works with the admin account for him tho I think hey shirlyn we're testing spectacle atm and getting quill sso errors on login 400 getting returned from auth/sso
OH WAIT i changed whitelist what's your app port on i can add to quill	localhost:5000 and if u can add 3000 too that'd be great
just the base url? not /login?	ohhhh i think it is /login let me check oh yeah it's /login and i don't think we need 3000 whitelisted too
Not David/Kevin :p	Lol ok
Hey u seem athletic do u wanna play Ultimate Frisbee?	RN? I am currently agonizing over 6.009 lab Thanks for calling me athletic tho
Yeah ehhhh labs slabs u can do those like tmrw Yeah no problem but not athletic enuf to play Ultimate ig	:ooo I am bad TM I was too lazy to find the TM emoji So Just pretend
Ohhh alright we'll just be ballin without u	Good luck Have fun
Are you doing this?	"I'm considering t But ts the day after career fair and a weekend So I'm waiting to see if I'll be busy then Also 
The deadline to register isn't until late so I'm just gonna wait and see R u doing it Feels flp-y"
yeaa not sure... if other ppl are doing it, i will. depends on others. because, the counselors/activities cant compare to flp but at least if a moderate amt of other ppl are doing it, then it'll be fun just as is a class filled w/ peers despite a strict teacher :P	OK I see u why do u and dave use this emoji
":P idk it's my go-to....... like when i say what i ""type"" in real life, my voice's inflection contributes a lighter tone which isn't conveyed through plain text. the "" :P "" crudely, and perhaps too frequently inserts this light tone into our words. or i suppose if i were to have a conversation in real life, "" :P "" indicates that my smile would increase in size (or if I wasn't smiling at the time, then that I would smile)."	This was a very formal explanaion and I'm very pleased with it Lol interesting thouh
O I’m currently in a group with one other person but idk if he asked more people yet I’ll get back to you okie i asked him, he said he hasnt asked anyone yet and he's down so i'd be down to group :)	oh cool ok i'll add you to our gc! if u want to add your friend i just added u to the gc
jamieee can u add me to the github lul	yee i invited u
tyyy	it was with a capital s right
ya i got it	yay great there's nothing on there as of now but it exists
hey jamie im not sure if youre already doing this, but right now the website is assuming the requests return a json formatted string we tested the user thign for the website using this, and i think it should work	Wait are u passing it in as a string Wait as long as u make the request to the endpoint properly that means the request was passed in correctly I'm pretty sure it's essentially the Python representation of a dict Also I tested out the website locally and u guys are using 3 dependencies that don't get installed on npm install So they need to be added manually One of them is react-router-dom One of them is axios And the last one is uuid
O yeah true hey jamie, so since we cant use socket on the server, we might need to edit a few parameters on the backend to sync all the players up	sure lol what does this mean
so socket lets live updating happen, so if one person hits start game, you can make it so all of the people on the page go to the next page but since we cant use socket, we would have to do like continuous get requests to the server to check to see if the game as started	hmm you're right yeah do u know how u want to fix it
yeah donald and i will look into it more and let you know later lol we'll also ask leon what to do	also what does the thing joe said about hosting it on the server mean if the handwriting api things go well i can help with web dev stuff for the next two milestones i'm not sure tho interfacing with google apis is always rough lmao so much authentication
yeah np i think donald and i are pretty much almost done building the actual pages the main things that are left are syncing up everyone to actually play the game and then putting everything on the server	oh wowowowowo you guys got a lot done lol the pic u had on the homescreen initially was so funny should have left it
o god	and joe that the pic of him was bad LMAO
donald refused to remove it until wednesday	LOL
donald also chose that	should thank him he is beauty he is grace
mhm mhm	he is penis behind the face lmfao
aaaaaa	ok sorry lol but yeah the timing thing is rough
the main thing we're worried about if we use the get requests is that it would be really slow	yeah i see your point hmmmmmmmm what if the host just hardcoded a start time and that was when the game started for everybody so u have to be in by then
o yeah that would be a way around it we'll look into it lol	wait i'm not familiar with how this works but can u pass some property into some parent class in react that signifies the state of the game
hmmmm	and the game page renders based on that property so if it gets changed by one user it should change for the rest
ooo we will also look into that lol honestly i still dont really understand how react works	lol same
i watched like 6 hours of youtube videos on monday on webdev	:ooooooo dedication i don't think i've worked that long this entire week
donald did weblab but he forgot everything lol	ooof lmao ok last suggestion:  maybe u guys have already found this but redux is something that can be used with react to maintain state as  afunction of actions on previous states 
ooo okie ngl we'll probably figure out this mostly after the 006 exam lol but tyy	i'm actually tryna get more into web dev these days so if i can accelerate my work i'll have time in milestone 3 or 4 to help eek yes i haven't even started studying ffff
i have a fluids exam on the same day too lol but pnr	oh rippppp yeah gotta really appreciate it now ig
hey jamie when u have time, could u add another element into the scores database thats like ready and then the value is true or false	oh are u adding some functionality that allows a user to mark themselves as ready
yeah	ok sure
and then could the get users.py also return that boolean value	yes
o and then the post for score.py also include an optional ready argument lol thats just true and false, and itll update inthe database lul tyyy	ok sure
"hey jamie, donald and i are having a little trouble parsing lists from get requests, so when u update the functions could u change the format a bit ill send some example ones that are workign for get user.py {""players"": [{""user"": ""donald"", ""userID"": 1234, ""ready"": false}, {""user"": ""sushi"", ""userID"": 5678, ""ready"": true}]} for get scores.py {""userScores"": [{""userId"": 125, ""userName"": ""Donald"", score: 50},{""userId"": 111, ""userName"": ""Shuxin"", score: 75}]} and hopefully the list value for userScores"" is sorted based on the score value (higheest score first)"	Wdym by working here U want the responses as jsons? I can do that yeah
or yeah lol i made dummy test files on my server to debug the formatting easier and those seem to work tyyyy	I'll change some of the json key names to match the database tables but other than that the format is fine probably
yahhh tyy	I was having trouble jsonifying things earlier because flask jsonify doesn't work on the server but I'll give it a shot I have some time tn
aa ok imma head off to bed, my brain is dead lol, but donald might be working a little while longer when you finish some stuff, could u let him know lul	lol ok i'll let him know gn
"gn hey jamie, for prompt.py, if u could return something like {""prompts"": [{""user_id"": ""1234"", ""username"": ""test1"", ""prompt"": ""testprompt1""}, {""user_id"": ""5678"", ""username"": ""test2"", ""prompt"": ""testprompt2""}]} that would be good just for formatting also i might need to ask u to make a few adjustments to image.py"	are you trying to get all the prompts at once
its because every browser needs to make a get request to image.py, so we can't automatically mark them as seen	what is image.py
o yeah oops drawings.py	yeah i mark them as seen on the backend so you'll only ever get drawings back that haven't been seen before so u can just keep making requests to that endpoint until all drawings have been exhausted
i modified the code and put it on my own server and it seems to work fine o yeah thats fine but since every browser needs to make a separate get request it just ends up with every user getting a different drawing i just added in a param for prompt = promptname of drawing and if thats in the get request, then it marks it as seen	oh i see ok if it works for you then it's good actually do u wanna just send that over i can just modify the folders a bit and put it on that endpoint
yeah u might have to adjust it a little because i made it so it also took posting drawings just so i could post new drawings easier	ah ok i see cool thanks
tyyy also None works kinda funky with javascript equivalence so i changed it to 0	the only other endpoint i need to make this week is GET guesses.py so if u have any return body specifics for that lmk too
but other than that i think mostly everything is the same	ok sure
"o oops i meant prompt format above as guesses srry should've specified {""prompts"": [{""user_id"": ""1234"", ""username"": ""test1"", ""prompt"": ""testprompt1""}, {""user_id"": ""5678"", ""username"": ""test2"", ""prompt"": ""testprompt2""}]}"	also for any of the other endpoints lmk what u need for those this week will probablly just be formatting and makingn changes but if ik them all beforehand then we won't have to go back and forth wait what
yeah sorry i said prompt.py that one is fine	for guesses.py?
just this format for guesses.py yeah	"oh so replace all prompts swith ""guesses"""
u can change the name of the elements or whatever	oh ok yeah makes sense
and i think last thing for now, is it possible to like reset databases lol because i think donald and i are just going to make it so all the databases get reset at the end of the game	yeah we can just drop all tables at the end of the game i have a drop.py endpoint yall can use at the end
tyyy thatshould be most of the backend we need	yeee
donald might talk to u about syncing start and what we're planning to do	"alright sure GET /prompt.py {""prompts"": [{""userID"": ""1d8a5d77-4252-41b7-af02-5ef3c371ef2e"", ""user"": ""jamie"", ""prompt"": ""Hair""}, {""userID"":

""1fe528a-3fa5-4017-2c0e-e7602b4ad3a"", ""guess"": ""Cloud Google Platform ""}]} btw i'm kind of confused as to what you're try9ing to achieve for the get drawings paramter i'm assuming you're passing in a parameter in ""prompt"" and just marking it as seen and i think from what i see you're keeping track of the prompts and what's been displayed on your end"
O yeah the guesses should be fine And yeah I just want it so a normal get requests gives the image But if you add in a param prompt It marks the image with that prompt as seen	what's the difference tho like why do u need to mark it as seen if you know what prompt u want every time i can just get rid of the thing that looks for an unseen drawing and just return the drawing for the prompt that u pass in
O no that’s fine Like we still want it to cycle through all unseen drawings The added prompt is so that we can mark the drawings that have already been displayed as seen at the very end The main problem before was that since every user made a separate get request to the prompt It marks that image as seen and only shows it to one user So every user ended up with a different image	oh i see ummm i feel like this isn't great though because the fetchone returns the drawings in order but like i'm not sure if that's going to do it in order every time but if it's been working for u
O wait did you change prompt.py	i can leave it yeah i did u wanted all prompts as jsons right
O when I was talking about all the prompts I meant that for guesses.py Liek all the user inputted prompts prompts.py was fine D:	lmao what well it's still up at prompt1.py
Oof	it's just one word right that u want back
Yeah that’s fine Sorry lol	i overwrote my old stuff from two iterations ago brooooo i was so confused
Yeah I meant that format for guesses.py	ok well that is also up lol
Yeah tyyyy sorry for making u do extra work D:	lol all good LMAO it wasn't too bad ok i think it works but there's currently no drawings in prompts_table so you'll have to post some dummy data i'm about to drop all tables btw so make sure there's in there you need
hey jamie for drawings.py is it possible to add in another element thats the user_id that drew the drawing?	yeah sure
Okie tyyy We just need it so that the person who drew it Doesn’t guess anything or choose anything	ah got it alright done try it out?
o uh	lol u dont need to rn
is there a fast way to post drawings/guesses lol	yeah u can just use postman and send data to data1.py or guess1.py that's how i typically test my endpoints
"uhh did you have a list of coordinates handy for a test word lul im getting ""could not detect text"" user_id does work btw tyy mm also im getting an error when trying to mark drawings as seen uhh i think this should be delete_prompt lul i think donald is just changing that lol if u dont mind"	Ah rip yeah Sorry about that feel free to change
um im making slight change to guess1.py to include the actual prompt too if u dont mind	wait that's an esp endpoint tho
just the get not the post	ah ok
yeah i dont really dont feel like figuring out how to like include a random correct prompt in js LOL	lol alright
yeah im just going to random.shuffle at the end o wait did u redo the changes to drawings.py? its not returning the user_id anymore	i made the changes yesterday maybe when donalld logged onto the server he made changes on an old version and saved them
o ok uh can you re scp drawings.py? i can also just rewrite it lol	anyhow i just made the changes again
o ok tyy	um shuxin what change did u make to get /guess1.py
this should be it did something break	yeah no i'm looking at it right now and i don't really understand what you're trying to do
yeah so it pulls the actual prompt and includes it with the user_id that drew the prompt and then i added a score parameter because there might need to be score differentiation later like choosing the correct promptv choosing someone else's prompt	are those just like arbitrary for now
yeah	you shouldn't get points for guessing the wrong prompt right
yeah the person who wrote the wrong prompt gets points	ah hmm ok i see
i might add in another if statement so that it doesnt include guesses from the person who drew the image	i'm on the server rn i'll do it real quick
aa okie ty yeah just check if its the same as correctPrompt[0]	yeah
aa its working nice	will u guys demo the dropping tables in your video
yeah	ok cuz joe asked us the other day about the point of the postman requests and iw as like yeah it actually doesn't make sense for me to keep doing these if you guys are actually making them on the website
yeah we can just show that the lobby and stuff are reset the website should be mainly good? i still need to work on displaying alternative screens for people who drew the actual drawing	i'll pull the most recent stuff onto my computer and test it rn
and maybe some fine tuning for the scoring system rn its whoever wrote that prompt gets 100 points or if you guess the correct prompt, whoever drew that image gets 200 points	oh i see and you'lll need to do points for guessing the correct prompt too
yeah ill try to do that too lmk when youre done testing since technically only one game can go on at a time O wait rn the guesses also display the userid of the person who put that guess I put it there for debugging	oh yeah there was no data posted so i only tested bare functionality since it looked like it dropped everything so i'll repost some sample data using postman looks good tho lol how's the website looking should we sync up with kade and marina to test like a game
uhh theoretically everythign should be there but im eating dinner rn lol i havent gotten the chance to test everything yet	lol alright cool dwai
if they want to try the website out i can really quickly change the timers so everything isnt 15 seconds lol	haha ok i'll text him and see how he's approaching the demo
also rn its still 200 points to the drawer if the correct button is chosen, and 100 points to the person who wrote the wrong prompt if that is chosen theoretically the person who drew the image still sees all the prompts, but their button presses do nothing	haha ok that's fine for now milestone 3 is on the repo btw
hey jamie is there a endpoint to send up guesses rn?	Nope but when do u want it by
Just sometime this afternoon lol	ok it's guess2.py and prompt1.py has been modified as well
o okie tyy o quick q is guess2.py take a user id and guess string? uhh i had to ake some slight edits to backend lol i commented this out since it was returning an error and then the correctPrompt line into prompts_table was seen = 1, and it should've been 0? toher than that i think everythings working	oh yep yeah it should be 0 ok great
did you end up doing esg?	Yeah
oh damn i was going to do it to but i think i'm just going to be basic and do an advising seminar	Still good Which one
quantum computing's my first choice because why not	Ayethats cool That might be my third or fourth choice So like What r u doing Rn At this moment in time

O Did you use recursion to find the bacon number Bc that’s what I tried but it takes way too long But I can’t think of another way	No I think u can use a while loop and a dict I used recursion tgough So it's a bit unfortunate Cuz it's not efficient
Yeah mines super inefficient A while loop and a dict? That’s for without recursion?	Yeah I think it's possible
Okayyy Thanks	Yeah np
wait do you mean dict or set?	Dict but I'm sure u can also use set But there's something called breadth first search Which I didn't use But I was recommended to
Okay I’ll look that up Thanks bro	Yeah np
wait sorry one more question: approx. how long did your function take for part 4 part 4 was to find the set of actors with bacon # = 6 in the large dataset	Less than 10 for all numbers
You missed a call from SiYoung.	Have u eaten uet To Yet* Do u want to eat w me at McCormick

Lmk when you get to mcc	ok sure I'll be there in 5 HAPPY BIRTHDAY
O thankssss	Hello friend happy birthday
Lmaooo thanks just saw your post so i might be nitpicking but i agree in general with what you wrote but	oh hey what's up
uhh idk i think that it's true that we can't assume everything based on how much or how little we post on social media because shit's complicated but i also think that, specifically for Asian americans, when people stay silent on social media, it further exacerbates the mentality of staying silent and watching i basically agree with what you wrote but i think that what you said allows people to just not do anything and feel okay with staying silent yea that's it	hmm ok yeah i see your point i think like i struggle with that a lot too cuz like i do a lot of watching and i'm not really active on social media i think that what i was trying to say is like people can be active in more ways than just expressing their opinions of support on social media
definitely true	"because a lot of people area always like ""oh your social media post isn't doing anythiing go sign a petition"" so that's what made me think to write that idk is there something i can add that would clarify this point a little more"
hmm unsure its 6 AM right now and my brain doesn't function so uhh words lol	LOL why are you up so early wait
i couldn't go to sleep then mindy sent me this viral chinese-am post and then i got heated and now here i am	does this mean you're up late rather than up early?
yeah i am up late haven't slept	holy
wheeeeeee	omg
this is not fine but it's fine	yeah i saw the post i think a lot of asian americans are like that
yeah so mindy and i started getting super heated and we like zoom called for a while and then i started writing up an op ed	post that shit
oh continue sry	oh no i was just gonna say like it feels like a very common asian mindset that we get taught all our lives like don't meddle don't rock the boat
hmm for sure	yeah anyways it was not great to read
it really wasn't actually i'll just comment on your post with some of what i said earlier	yeah that makes sense thanks for the comment :)) looks like you and mindy had the same train of thought so i was glad for both of your comments
yeet np actually we kinda discussed before we made our comments	oh LOL i see that makes sense
yeah we kinda use each other to flesh out our thoughts	you know i feel like at some point you should sleep
for like feedback oh yeah that	that's good lol
sleep unfortunately i have a MISTI meeting in two hours	holy oh you're still doing a misti? damn that's rough
yeah since i'm in korea anyways there's no danger of 'international travel' since all i'm doing is taking a bus up to seoul	oh are you in a suburb of seoul also i've been watching this one korean yt's cafe channel lately u just reminded me
no i'm in gwangju like four hours south what channel?	oh that's kind of farther than i imagined
yeah i'm like the only korean person i know that's not from the seoul area as in korean am or korean international students what ru doing for the summer?	 damn really? just remote uroping :// plans cancelled
on top of all of this i've been courseroading like a crazy woman for the past three days because i am going through yet another existential crisis about like sellout culture and med schoolllllll ughhhhh idk thoughts?	bro i've been like courseroading but in my head yo same all the time
lmfao	i never knew u were thinking med school
...	what do u like to do more
am i though *screams honestly we should zoom sometime about this because i have many thoughts	lol sure i'm at the stage where i just don't know what i like so i'm pretending i like everything
does that mean that you're trying out diff things? that's not bad	dude idk why but i didn't even try them out yet like i'm gonna try to learn some more this summer but in my head i think i'd like it next semester though i'm only taking like one 6 class i took too many last spring burned out
what classes ru thinking of taking?	046 probably then 14.01 a 15 finance class maybe a music class for my hass i'm debating
debating is good im also taking 6.046 and 14.01	aye i thought everyone took 14.01 last semester so i thought i'd be lonely
i've been thinking a lot about econ and policy and stuff and applications with CS and stats so yeahhhhh let's see how that works out	that could be really interesting
hmm yeah do you ever think about not just what you like now, but what you'll like in the future? because that's 90% of what i am conflicted over	all the time
because liking CS =/= liking a CS job	i can't imagine myself out of school
omg relatable	yeah my externship over iap convinced me that like doing a pure software engineering job was not it for me
why? i think the same for me	"plus i felt lonely and i was like ""is this what it feels like to be an adult?"" i just felt like i was sitting at a desk all day coding something someone else told me to do and i couldn't decide on the design or features and that was boo"
would it be better if you could decide? like if you worked your way up to be a product manager or something for me i struggle a lot with, as cliche as it is, 'contributing to society' and that vs financial stability	yeah i think so one of my big things is like i don't like doing conceptually repetitive work and by conceptually i mean like if i'm applying the same tools over and over to solve different problems i still think that's kind of meh yeah i think coming into college i was ambitious about changing the world but now i'm kind of disillusioned about that i think either way i want to do something that feels satisfying but i'm less sure of the impact i'll have so i'm now being like less choosy about the field i go into
i think that's fair, you shouldn't compromise your own happiness when it comes it i think i was also disillusioned sometime in the fall but somehow i am reinvigorated and am still quite ambitious about the changing the world thing	omg that's so good i think for me i just need to take some time to just build up my own skills and confidence in them so i can start being ambitious about what things i want to do
ah same i have zero skills	like the worst is like i can't imagine anything i could do now with the skillset i have now and i'm not just talking like technical skills i also think i need to work on like presentation skills speaking skills creativity
omg yes and leadership, organization	worsking under pressure yeah all these things haha so great
LOL yeah i lived there for 6 yrs before coming to college	oh wow wait i might know someone who went there will kim mayb
hmm	also i know an ally lee that went to chadwick international school but that's a small chance that you know her
i searched him up and we have hella mutual friends like 100	oh what lmao
wait did he go to sis? oh i think he did	i'm not sure because he moved around a bit but he was in korea for a while and i saw on the sis page he checked in there before
i've never talked to him in my life	he went to milton in mass for hs tho it looks like lol but so many mutuals
yeah he probably went to sis maybe before i moved to korea	ver interesting yeah i haven't talked to him in almost 3 years now lmao but i just knew him well at a period in my lifetime
oh wow wild yeah tbh when people are like do u know this random korean there is a decent chance we at least have mutual friends LOL	LMAO yeah whenever i see something even remotely similar to somebody i know i'm like i gotta check i gotta check even tho it makes no sense
omg!! amazing	That's 7 for 7 baby
dude yesterday i realized that sean knight is the sean i sorta know from 8.02	Lmfaoo nice
and he friend requested me a long time ago but i didnt know	Wow u really did that to him
that it was him cuz his profile picture is like a color so i never accepted and i will accept it now HAHAH	Niceeee your assassins target is allen wang - check go/assassins for the rules, starts tonight at 12am
: OOOO not allen chen??	no sir
o okidoki	:DD good luck text me/jack if you have any contested kills, but otherwise if you kill someone just have them pass on their target to you
LOL okay sgsg	nice hey soomin you coming tn
Jams while I still remember Any tips for the presidencies	Hmmm uh OK wait this is actually a big thing Talk loud whenever you talk in crowds and raise your tone a bit Your voice is so low a lot of people can't hear it sometimes Be assertive and confident even when you aren't sure about something. You can just be like I'm pretty sure it's this but let me find out for u U have to make people respect u as a leader basically For NHS try to give every officer at least one task per meeting For hosa do your best to keep track of everything that's going on As president your goal isn't to do the most manual labor Its to organize the other people in an efficient manner and make sure everything is covered Management essentially And smile more lmao srihari U want to look approachable and enthusiastic Lmk if u have any other questions but this is what I can think of in terms of general leadership lmao thanks for paying me back srihari
	Got any time to tutor two kids in fall? Rising 8th and 9th algebra 2 and 1 respectively If not u know any other seniors who might want to?
Depends on when	Once a week 2 hours each time is negotiable with the mom but usually after school or evening At the library
Aye papi I have rehearsals mw and class tth And games on Fridays sometimes So maybe mw like right after school or smth? Or I might have to ask around or post on nhs	Right after school will probably work with them Do u want me to give the mom your number T see if it works out
Sure Actually wait Realistically September and October are a bad idea If I’m not tryna kill myself Which I probably shouldn’t	Know anybody else who wants r
I’m not sure	Hmm ok Anyways she needs a new tutor so
Aight so what can I do	Idk I just don't know people in your grade so that's the problem
Weekends would be so much easier welp Uh honestly no one pops in my mind for tutoring I know a lot of dudes	I can ask her if that works later Just give me some names of sum good seniors? If u can
Yeah uh Vibha comes to mind I’m thinking of math people eek What about Katie dong Not a senior obv but idk	The older one will be in 9th grade Idrk it could work Who else u got
I’m trying to think of non band people but that’s kind of my life welp Ankith Udupa	LOL
Linda ! But she’s super busy probably because she’s linda	Hey what about Oh yeah Linda
What about Whomst *whomst	I'm forgetting now omf
Wow	Ummm Wow I feel really bad Your best friend dude
Zoe?	No omfg Why can't I remember his name
Who’s my best friend in your eyes Adi	Sidapara??? No Robotics
Vinay?	Holy
Who’s sidapara	Oh yeah Vinay What about him does he have time I need someone really patient
He’s in band and dual enrolling So no evenings	Well I guess not
I mean maybe idk you could ask I love tutoring but I seriously think it might be borderline unhealthy if I take it on	Oh what about Katie song Should I ask her
Don’t know her	Hmm OK I will then lmao
Have fun Jams I am in the heat of college apps forgive me But where did you apply And where did you get into I’m curious And going slightly insane	Uh just the ivies mit Stanford uc and umich basically Princeton Berk UCLA Irvine umich I mean it won't help u that much but less is more should be your takeaway from that
All of the ivies?	Because you're so busy in the fall you won't have time to invest in 25 apps No the big ivies sorry
Which is	Hypsm Not cornell Or dartmouth Is brown even an ivy
Yes	Oh Not brown
Hm I have four ea And like ten others on the list for regular	Which
Uh Caltech mit umich and uchicago for ea	Forgot all of those weren't single choice damn
Non New York ivies, Stanford duke msu on regular Wait	Why uchic
I’m missing one I feel like	What ivy is in new york
Columbia and Cornell Damn	What the totally didn't know Columbia was an ivy
You didn’t apply to Columbia then	Yeah but why uchic
Okay anyway Uh I don’t know it seems interesting Honestly I’m very unsure about what I want Because career plans aren’t set in stone or even close to it I’m not sure what kind of school life I want But uchicago is very different and it’s attractive	What's your prospective major
Thinking biochem primarily ChemE is what I put for secondary when they have it	Alright I gotchu You're applying LSA then?
I think so? Man I’ve just been trying to do essays when I can I know I probably don’t know as much as I should’ve lol *should	that's good starting earlier is good eh biochem is not very available in school anways u can't just get good at it by doing high school is what i mean so nobody really knows
I mean about all my colleges heh Yeah idk here’s the thing I love chemistry so I know that’s my route And the brief discussions about molecular biology in ap bio were very exciting for me And it being related to living things makes it more meaningful to me and gives me a direct avenue to help people So that’s the thought process	hm ok i see i see yeah i mean i assume that not all your essays will be about biochem tho like i assume that a big part of them won't be actually
I don’t think a big part of anyone’s essays are necessarily about their major My common app essay is about being competitive but in the context of a math comp The pleasure mit essay is about spreadsheets but obviously I guess that one wouldn’t be I actually put cheme for the mit department because it caught my eye a while back and they have pretty broad ranging and dope stuff Did a caltech essay on math competitions welp Not essay essay It just asked about inspiration to do stem Idk yeah I feel like my personality is more important than my tangible interests so maybe it’s better that way	yeah that's the point you have to be abble to write about the math competition creatively tho becuase a lot of people do math so it's very hard to write it well
This probably makes it sound like I don’t care but I’m not really worried about trying to sound unique Like I know who I am and I just want to convey that I’ll just try to sound like myself and hope colleges like it	yeah i'm not saying that's bad or anything but just consider this for a second there's a lot of people in the world that like the office and out of those lot of people maybe to 20% of those people the office means the world to them so they may choose to write an essay about the office but there's still 20% of those lot of people that like the office
inb4 I take the app Ls then	and out of those people maybe 3% of them write about it well which is great and it's valuable to you but each person no matter how important the office is to them is more than the office they have a broad range of values right like for me it was like i felt so often that my life was characterized by the three or four big things that i did and it kind of was but in truth there's so many things that contribute to me too that are equally as valuable but necessarily smaller and they were necessarily smaller because they were more niched i guess? ig i'm just saying that just because you choose to write about something that you think isn't a huge huge part of your life doesn't make it any less you
I don’t know the big things tend to be the ones I can actually write about Like I can’t talk about being a stickler for ethicality and sound real at all At least to myself	that makes sense it's hard
I can talk about the pain of competitiveness That’s pretty easy So I did	yeah in the end just go with what you really want to do
Idk and well everything I do is basic HOSA band NHS math chem	won't force u to do anything u feel hesitant about doing obviously i wrote about hosa for one of mine also i think a big part of the college app process is really thinking carefully about youself
Lol that’s the easy shit	like the thing that u just mentioned
I do it all the time	it was easy to write about u said and in honesty all my essays i thought were good was like wringing water out of a massive towel it was so hard to quantify what i wanted to say in words all about discovery and rediscovery man i mean you have an older sister she probably gave u tons of advice already just my two cents
Eh again I’m aggressively reflective She didn’t I don’t bother her much with that I wrote a 700 something word one about her that I could probably never use anywhere	oh well consider asking her maybe like two questions she knows u to an extent right
Not really I tell her the events of my life but she doesn’t really know me me Probably thinks I’m a terrible person Probably isn’t wrong What were “small things” you wrote about then	who does tho i mean she can give u ideas is what i'm saying like ask people to describe you to them
"Idk I think you also need to remember that I haven’t lived with her for three years
Idk she’s been some help though"	what about just essay writing tips or proofreading nothing about content then
Yeah I’ll ask her to read at some point I have a massive ego when it comes to descriptors but I can try	descriptors? damn me too tho like i hate it when my parents try to fix my writing but my parents deal with my shit anyways like i ask them to read
Oh I meant asking people to describe me	oh well
Huh	now u know i'm an asshole
Oh I mean	yeah same concept tho
I have writing ego too Gut shots every time someone’s like ehhh Even though I’m not a good writer Makes it worse	just pick like 3 trusted very good writers to proofread okay wait that's not everybody's style tho like zoe had everybody read hers
Oh I’m fine with anyone reading mine	different things for everybody my concern is that you may get pulled in several different directions none of which will help u
I reject a lot of writing advice eek	happens to all of us it's very hard to accept that much criticism for 6 months straight
I had one person tear my common app essay apart essentially but I still kept some blatant flaws because they were very me lol	yeah keep the stuff you feel strongly about
Woof	no more advice tho that's it from me hope i helped
Aye I know I’m not being very receptive *insert excuse here* but thank you I’ll look over this later Many thanks	lol yeah no problem i get it omg i feel fucking HONORED
:DDD	what is this for lol
It was between that and tree Hoco court	omg i like this i bid u good luc i hope u get it
Get what King?	whatever u want
Lol I don’t care I’m jus happy to be here	That's good Be happy
Wow thanks You Do that too	lol i'll try
Lit JAMMMMSSS You probably don’t remember but if you do What did you put for time commitment for nhs	ooh i don't remember but r u asking weekly
Yeah	5 I think? I don't really remmeber
How you get 5	Agenda writing planning for meeting attendance then holding the meeting Something like that
Oh jeez okay	Yeah but I didn't put that in description Just like Broad overarching responsibility
Yeah I’m I’ll probably just put an hour for 18 weeks *um	Lol okay whatever u want
 Thank	Ye Omg shrubs u created an exam cram event???
Nope Unless I was sleeping While doing it	Oh Well I just got an NHS reminder About flooding and exam cram How r u btw
That was a library thing Tired but that’s just me not sleeping recently Mostly just appreciating almost being done with app stuff How bout you	That's really good u should appreciate this time There's never going to be anything like it again lmao Get sleep be health Sounds cool tho Not the flooding part Kind of having an existential crisis every day But I'm used to it
I mean it’s not like I exactly have free time it’s just being spent on significantly less annoying and consequential things And uhhhh I am not what is this	It's like I have no idea what sort of job I want to have anymore
That’s a big mood What’s triggering it	This job lol All January we get to do whatever so there's this externship program that I'm doing so I'm basically interning for a month
Not what you expected?	yeah basically
You’ve got a whole bunch of Januarys to figure it out And other months	Like
Like who	3
And all the other months	I suppose This remove a message thing always freaks me out
I almost never do it it seems strange But I accidentally sent gudetama saying whatever and I figured it was in very poor taste	Wait what was this aboy Lmao It's ok I won't be hurt
It wasn’t intentional You said like and I said like who Everything is a who	oh like 3 that sent in the right order right
Sure Idk you’re clearly using the in/externships right then To actually get a taste of the job	yeah i guess that's the point feelsbadman well not that bad but bad how r u
I think you already did that one	well tell me more
I’ll be in Boston on February 29th Anywho Idk man Tired gang because I’ve been practicing until like 5 every day and just YouTube to the late nights And still random shit that I keep cramming for Idk what else NHS gets a little frustrating	wait what why marimba?
Got an audition at New England conservatory	OOOH YAY congrats
Yeah and then I come home dead and it’s a vicious cycle Thanks But like again with cramming I haven’t even started rehearsing for the audition because I have a ton of S&E music and a concerto	This happens to be adulthood as well But your life shouldn't be like this yet What the concerto for
A couple of competitions But yeah I think my real break is only when school ends	I think mayhaps you r trying to give yourself a hard time this spring
Eh I’m not complaining There’s just a lot of things I wanted to do So I am	Well Hen that's good Do u feel satisfied with your life
Nope But that’s because of things outside of my control so it’s whatever	well what sorts of things make u feel unsatisfied because it seems like all your stressful things were an active choice right
Yeah School is dumb	i agree
Like none of my classes are difficult or consistently interesting	but isn't it p chill by now oh yeah but chill
I just coast through my days it’s annoying I should just become areeb Hopefully diff eq provides some sort of challenge I mean there’s also like random deadlines for shit that keep happening and I can’t study for chem and I wanna	what does that mean lmao you're so motivate d and you want to be challenged what a concept oh is chemoly in the spring?
Idk maybe I just hoped to busy on my own terms but instead I’m bored for like six hours a day and have to deal with deadlines for dum ^stuff I mean yeah there’s only so much I can idle Yeah except with two months to go I haven’t started studying and I’m triggered at myself	yeah i mean your classes must be awful then i can't remember exactly but i felt my senior year classes were actually p interesting / i had fun in them
Imagine that Last year was the shit This year micro makes me wanna die it’s so bland Marketing is marketing Lit is like very sporadically cool And psych is aggressive memorization and I’m not down for it	aha glad i didn't take psych then well actually i like psychology but not memorization
I thought psych would be fun I think I was looking for more sociology or philosophy	Oh huh yeah that might not be the same thing
Or less disparate theory Idk My corner of the classroom is a clown show tho so that’s fun	Lol niceeee
 K your turn	  Is that what u meant
I meant talking	Oh Hold on I have to bike to work rn I'll text u when I'm there I forget how early u kids have to wake up for school Last night I slept at 1 and that was a nightmare waking up this morning for work
An athlete wAo Fam never forget that you’re a freshman smh my head But imagine going to school	Lmao who's the kid here??? Yeah imagine Nope I get beat up by the bike ride Every morning
Y o u That’s all I can do I didn’t go You should press charges	Wait what Against
The bike ride Not at school Tell your brother he got an honorable mention for all state	Why OK I will What does that mean
He’s like One of the two next best percussionists they didn’t take Damn kid is wildin	Ohhh So almost there How many did they taje Never as wild as u
Around six lemme check 7 And man I never got anything until sophomore year I auditioned both year in middle school to no avail And then started taking lessons freshman year But didn’t audition Then I’ve made it the past three So I blame lessons	So the lessons will hopefully get him there You worked hard tho My brothers lazy
I don’t think he’s that lazy But uh Yeah I’m not saying he’s guaranteed next year or anything But sophomore year he should definitely have a quality shot	OK that's nice to hear haha Thanks srihari Meh
I mean all state is a crap shoot so you can’t be sure but it’s impressive Your mama was stressing about doing tennis and marching band though	Ahaha yes she was I heard she talked to u At this rate it'll be hard for him to make the team tho
Really?	Yeah coach Anderson said that they would give an equal or slightly worse junior over him
Eh	Nehh
How would you describe his skill level	i honestly wouldn't know i'm pretty musically illiterate these day
I meant tennis I can judge his music smh	Oh Tennis he's just aight Flaky tennis Sometimes good mostly bad
That’s me	hi friend wanted to check in w u
hilo I got waitlisted that's a positive for me	hi there u doing ok? when do ivies come out
couple weeks	is there anywhere else you're trying for
yeah I feel a lot better because of this honestly johns and uchicago kinda smoked me	oh huh actually i have a few friends who were waitlisted idk what the percentage is but i don't think they just waitlist people nilly willy
it was 8.8% waitlisted+accepted last year	oh that's really small actually
wait	because isn't it like 7% accepted
yeah like 450 waitlisted or smth it's good I was fully expecting to get rejected so this is a nice way to go into the next couple weeks of waiting obviously unsure because I probably fit MIT criteria more than others but also it was an early app and some of the essays were b a d taking it as a net positive how's your coronacation going	:(( it's sad are you home for the next few weeks?
yeah until april 12th I think	oh that's a while i am self-isolated atm day 2 of it and it sucks
?	well i just got back from boston yesterday so i've been selfisolating in my room since yesterday afternoon
oh right right that's fun	not really but i appreciate your enthusiasm is everything else going ok w u
well I don't really have things to do idk they canceled band things and chem things so idk at all just gonna do them anyway to stay occupied	what is your prospective major in college
biochem or cheme	oh interestingggg

well both nec and berklee have dual degree programs with harvard	i'm pretty sure he said it was nec but i could also be wrong he does performances on the side now
I should meet this man seems like interesting folk	yes u should i only have work email though but next fall i can probably go pay the company a visit and see if u guys can meet up
ah yes I would very much appreciate actually being there this fall dude everyone seems so different	Wdym Well won't u be

hmk I'm so very scared currently trying to figure out how my near-18 years of bsing experience can translate to the next 4/5	OK Enough This is A time of celebration Don't think too hard Everything is like 20 to 45 times more chill than u imagine
I most definitely am not I can't focus on anything lmao	You'll be A Ok WATCH A TV SHOW I watched the good place a few weeks ago

I've gotten waitlisted at so many places no	Lmao exactly
but I have chem olympiad at some point in a month	Wait where else
lollll	I mean Harvard is like #1 though right so does it even matter
brown columbia cornell dartmouth duke princeton berkeley It doesn't matter	Wow thats A lot of waitlists
I love harvard like saranya loves kpop	I always just got straight rejects Well That's not quite right anymore
hey look relevant meme shushhhh	Daranya isn't into kpop
I've talked to her once in the last year shhhhhhhhhhh	Like that much anymore
shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh	Say something else
man	Yeah it doesn't matter You're chillin
the acceptance rates were so low this year it's not even funny	Probably would have been yeah More kids more applicants
they were really reaching with those extended deadlines	Oh what they extended deadlines? I am not Informed enough
yeah a lot of them were bumping shit back like a half week to a week	Nice Well Not nice but
it seemed so obvious that they were trying to boost rates	Nice
duke was fkin 4.3%	Ehh it be Like that It's just like elitism
again does not matter anymore	Yeah stop thinking Like Turn off your brain For just like
no NO	Half an hour please
my brain has been doing nothing forever since NW dumped me	Wait what Who dumped you Can u just
northwestern NINA WANG	Update me on your life please Who the fuck is Nina wang
joke she goes to mit she's a youtuber	Well Yes Ik
she's in your class	Ik
okay anywho I got rejected by johns uchicago nw and yale it's kinda funny dude even northwestern has a 5% acceptance rate this shit isn't nice	It be like that
why they doing this to peepos so mean why can't colleges be nice	They don't have enough room for everybody
thank you for your logical response bleghhhhh In other college related news I heard ashley's dad was lying about her acceptances Imagine being that parent wait I'm being a brick JAME-E HOW'S YOUR LIFE GOING	uhhh so is johns hopkins not real i mean ashley always thought she could do hs right
no johns is real	so like oh what did she lie about
I don't think ashley lied about anything	oh was this not what u were looking for
her dad it seems	ohh
about getting into 8 ivies	LMAO nice
that's kinda sad	you'd know somebody who could get into 8 ivies just by looking at them
like your daughter is killing it gets into columbia and princeton and regents berk and you still have to lie	oh she got into columbia and pton too? i only knew about johns
I didn't know about johns until yesterday Like I don't ask people in general and I've been especially offline recently but dwippers was filling me in	i didn't know about columbia and pton till just now
I only found out about deme getting into uchicago on tuesday well it's been less than a day lamo lmao luhmao luhmaocow	lol ok
anywho	she'll probably go to pton then? ashley i mean
I mean columbia is cool too but I'd assume she likes the princeton brand better also stanford is today so if she gets in there she'd definitely go	oh really? i thought that was the 1st lmk if u get in
no apparently their admissions posted on the tweeters or smth	like today?
I can let you know right now I'm definitely not	....
no a few days ago	why u don't know taht
I found out yesterday brO I've gotten into three colleges out of fifteen	ok i'm really confused what is ashley wanting to major in
and harvard I had quite possibly the greatest interview of all time	that's like a really high success rate u realize that right
uhhhh well she wants to go into law I think Is it	yes like hello that's really high and considering
I don't seem like stanford material whatever	that u only need to get 1
I also don't care so that doesn't hurt	is stanford law good
law is grad school homie what she do right now doesn't particularly matter does it from what I've gathered she was applying econ and bio depending on what she thought would get her in? this is all secondhand information for the most part actually her firsthand info is probably even less reliable	i mean yeah it doesn't matter that much but then what forms your basis for like what school u choose
wait wow apparently stanford is higher ranked than harvard law hot damn don't people usually try to go to a different university for grad	eh but is somebody going to be like wow stanford law or wow harvard law uhhhh sometimes
You asked if it was good I tried to answer	depends what kind of grad lol okok
what kind of grad would you not	like if you're getting a master's
I have so much to learn yikers	most schools have 5 year programs that just give u a master's after another year if you're like med school or law or like phd there's like a few select schools that breed those types of grad students righ so your options are limited anyways
hm Yeah I keep seeing premed people talk about avoiding places with grade deflation	are u trying to become an academic
Yes	oh professor ganesh i see u
Dude I'd love that	well grades matter a lot for premeds
I just worry that I'd have to deal with cheaters blegh I've been thinking about md/phd though idk	so like all the ivies do a pretty good job of inflating i feel like you'd like doing a phd
My harvard interviewer was a wonderful man I learned a lot	you mean like students? some schools don't require that professors teach unless u want to ofc
Well if I was a professor professor that's why I'd be one	oh not for research?
I like teaching but again college classes are probably impersonal no like research faculty professor	what i'm confused
Idk I distinguish I see what you're saying now Who knows I might be an art history major	i am so incredibly confused right now but ok i understand?
No like I wasn't thinking of research faculty as professors but I know what you're saying also terrible internet that decides to bail every five minutes didn't help with that interaction	oh well if you're a professor your main thing is to do research and you also teach professor's labs typically have research faculty that are trying to become professors or get a phd or whatever and if you don't do research as your primary focus you're probably a lecturere
yeah lecturing is boring booo	well kids are boring boo
WOW I've been having some pretty highkey baby fever recently	omg what lmao
I'M SINGLE BEFORE YOU SAY ANYTHING	LOL baby fever i don't know maybe u want to explain
dude being a dad has always been goal #1	aww that's cute and wholesome
yes I know thank you thank you I'll be here all quarantine	lmao u just want a kid? at the ripe age of 17
Yeah I figured i'd just steal one from a daycare but that's out of the picture now yeah idk I just really like kids wait why are we talking about this oh you called kids boring boo you	lOL i like some kids just not annoying ones but see that's the thing most kids are just annoying because that's how kids are lmao
yeah annoying but also tiny humans	you are an interesting specimen
uhhhhh okay enough shellfish JAMS HOW YA DOIN	what shellfish i have a lot of work piling up but i can't help it i just want to reorg my spotify lmao recently i've been having an existential crisis again so that's nice and my summer plans went to hell so that's not so nice
do you have premium	yeah i've had it for like wow nearly like 4 or 5 years now i think nearly 3 or 4 actually
oooOH they have student discounts right	yeah but i've been on a family plan so i pay like only 2.50 a month for this it's great
oh my friends were doing a family plan before I never joined hm okay what's the existential crisis this time	you should have it's so worth eh same thing like what am i doing with life in general what do i want out of this life
well what are you doing with life	dude that's the crisis
no I mean like in general this past year what have you done with your life	oh i've been educating playing some tennis here and there trying to get more involved with clubs trying to get into clubs and getting rejected trying to find a job succeeding and then failing and then succeeding and then failing and tyring to meet new people
so how life goes	Yep Life goes in many different ways tho
maybe it's too normal of a life for you	i'm not trying to be not normal my question doesn't have to do with like the exact actions i'm taking it's like more like what is my purpose what goal am i striving toward
That still kind of relates Your goal can be figuring out what your goal is but like I've spent high school doing a bunch of random shit, a lot of which doesn't really build towards anything	lol
but some of it did don't always have to know what you're doing man	lol ig stuff i do doesn't need to have a purpose but like i want the things i do to bring me happiness throw it out if it doesn't spark joy you know
and or but	uhhh like i'm saying irregardless of the existence of purpose it should make me happy
is this related to the problem or am I missing the point in one of several potential ways	uhhh it's like part of it you know like about what am i doing
do things not make you happy	no they do but like i am still searching for things that would bring me purpose and passion like true purpose and ik i don't need to find it right away but you know the search creates the existential crisis
yeahno I gotchu the whole lack of purpose existential crisis has been a repeat offender for me this year	eek same lmao we are smol beings in this world
yum yum yum	LOL WHAT oh how did stanford go
rejected heh	Ah Well It be like that sometimes
I don't care it feels so good	To be done right
well I'm not done done but it feels so good to not care	happy birthday srihari :DD

Ok Sounds like your problem	:oooo how'd your interview go
For some people I heard meetings were like basically a job offer but mine was an actual interview I could’ve done better but they did tell me to fill out the direct urop funding form instead of telling me to fuck off so maybe that’s a good sign	oh wait it was a urop position ? that's ok lol i just finished my interview can u let me know when mohamed asks CQs i don't think i can be there until 930 earliest

Nah they’re charging like $15 or smth	Oh wtf Jk I just woke up tai Please help me If there are any CQs
Ok there probably won’t be any today Wait you were like seemed wide awake at 8	I went back to sleep I was actually super fyckiny tired lmao how much does your ta care about grading your written psets
Idk she gave me credit even tho I skipped like most of the steps and algebra She only took points for the ones I got wrong on purpose	lmfao bruh this is sad colleen keeps taking points off because i don't put direction and she actually checks my fucking answers sm fucking h
Like k hats and stuff?	yeah like i got an 80
Wtf	on pset 3 and i just turned in 4 with even less work omfg if i actually have to try for this class i am going to throw hands
Switch tables lol	ughhhhhhh should i
Any ta can put in grades for anyone right	uhhh i'm pretty sure but can i just switch now
Idk ask my ta she’s pretty chill	shit i forgot her name already
It’s ok I still don’t know her name	oh kaylee or kailey
Don’t you have her email	yeah but i'm gonna track my TA down next week and ask her about my pset
And fight her	kind of want to i'm annoyed i actually did that pset is this irrational i feel like i'm being irrational i'm just not having a good week smh
That you want to fight your ta over 1% of your grade for a pnr class? Tbh 80 is really low Did smth else bad happen?	she took off 10 points for one question when i didn't explain any of my intuition but it really simple it was like negative - negative = negative is what i wrote and i wrote area under curve and wrote 2 * one of the areas yes it's allso 9% of my grade sir
If there’s like 14 psets then then 1 pset is less than 1% and the difference between an 80 and 100 is barely anything ma’am	well in total it's 9% and if we keep going at this rate i will be SAD
But yeah I don’t explain anything I just write equations	i am SAD
A betta days always comin Don’t think about 802 so much Worry about your graded classes	Mehhhh
The hack application is so fucking long wtf Do I have to do the second choice committee thing	not if you don't wnat to the first one is most important
Ok sweet	what committees are you applying to
Just logs I think Anna said to try and get the app in before 5 so that’s why I did it now It’s pretty cringy	ok sure lol it doesn't matter that it needs to be in by 5 but ok she probably just wnated u to get it in but thanks taiiii do you know where the lecture slides all are there's nothing past 05d1 on his dropbxo

You home already?	Yep Just got home a bit ago My parents are taking my quarantine very seriously
How long are you gonna quarantine	Like probably at least a weej It's OK in my room I can lay on the floor
Wait that doesn’t make up for being bored	I mean No it doesn't you're right I can't even unpack My mom said I have to leave everything in the car overnight She let me bring my laptop in tho So maybe I'll do my 036 lab R u at the airport now
Ubering there But like the first Uber I called wouldn’t take us	With Ben and jianna? Wait what
He had a suv and he said our bags wouldn’t fit	So he was wrong?
Then we called another one and he had a sedan and everything fit fine	Tsktsk
I think he was just scared when 2 fobby looking kids with face masks pulled up It’s just Jianna and I Ben is meeting us there	WHO IS THE FOB NOW Say hi to jianna for me How is she doinf
	Is he not done packing all his shoes yet Wow I'm not even physically there to smack u
Jianna’s fine not to flex I cried more than her Ben dropped his stuff off at his church friend’s house and he’s taking him there or smth	U big baby why didn't u cry when I left Also I meant the weed
Tears of joy Yeah she’s sober	Oh I see he's not storing it at maseeh?
Nah me neither	Is that the word u also use when people stop being high Oh how'd u get your stuff to zbt
Idk sober just means like not intoxicated right We had a van run It’s easier that way so I don’t need to pick up my stuff from maseeh next year	Idk man this is not a relevant question for me F Did u make it home alright
Almost back I got a layover rn	Yo wtf I thought were trying to avoid thay
I had like 50 mins for a layover but we sat on the runway for 30 mins It doesn’t matter that much I doubt anyone in nc has it Wait so did your parents let you eat dinner with them or did you eat in your room	uhhh i ate lunch in my room and i just woke up i feel like my body is going to take a while to recover this morning when i woke up it was like my forearms and hands were like on fire it was so weird
Wtf	like
Are you ok now	you how how sometimes after ur muscles are sore it was like that but more like i mean like yeah basically i'm not like dying or anything and ideally this is not corona wait but becasue your first driver wouldn't take u you had to catch a diffeernet flight?
Yeah cause I couldn’t checkin my bag 1 minute late	omfg they suck
It was my fault tho actually I was pushing my luck	i mean your rlight was at 5 3 was the right time to leave
No it was 4 lol I got cocky cause I made it leaving 30 mins before once But that time I didn’t have a checked bag	.... see this is why i had to leave early this morning :/// well you're almost there right
Yeah this airport is an hour and a half away from home driving It’s like 30 mins when you fly	did they reschedule your flight for free
Yeah	or did u book another one there ok great
Cause I said ma’am Gotta show southern hospitality	oh god they definitely appreciated that lmao  better days was ranked #1 i watched #2 wandering earth btw was pretty interesting and i still can't find it online if u have time u should watch projedt gutenberg tho
What’s it about	"""Summary: The Hong Kong police are hunting down a money counterfeiting gang led by a mastermind code-named ""Painter"". In order to crack the true identity of ""Painter"", the police recruits gang member Lee Man to unmask ""Painter's"" secret identity."" i think i'm about to rewatch it i literally have nothing else to do"
Sleep more I just slept 13 hours Which is like more than I slept the last three days at mit	i should have i'm really tired but i had like 10 hours last night but i also took like a 5 hour nap before that idk why i'm still so tired
Only 15 hours of sleep you need like 10 more Do you know how long you’re quarantining I’m kinda bored already	Like A week I am also bored But too tired to do work My parents also didn't let me being any of my stuff in w me Just my laptop
Are you allowed to bring it in now cause it’s been like 24 hours right	Yeah but then I'd have to get dressed and physically go grab it and make sure my family goes somewhere else while I do that lmfao I also found a movie link if you're inferested For gutenberg
Yeah sure I’m gonna unpack a bit first	lmao i got banned from sending the link because it goes against community standards
F 123movies?	fmovies or smth  ovies.tw/movie/ play/project-gutenberg-2018-1-2-3-hdiEd5gK/watch.html combine the two spaces i added i want you to know that i am now officially on season 2 of the good place please continue watching there is a huge plot twist at the end of season 1
Oh shit Is it still the same characters for season 2	yes you will be shocked
Idk if I’ll have time tmw My dad wants me to go fishing	SMH why r u fishing
He said quit being a little bitch about coronavirus you’ll be fine let’s go fishing And there are some big bois out there rn apparently	lmfao nice quality time ++

I’ll catch up ez Watch on 4x speed	how do u even do that how can u fully appreciate the art then have fun fishing tmrw tho lmao i have never been fishing before seems like a lot of waiting
Nah there’s no way unless you’re on crack or smth And fishing is basically school right you zone out for a few hours and maybe smth cool happens	.... no SIR that is not how it works
*high school	lol u and i had very different high school experiences ok but fr tho fishing could be very interesting if you're not sitting there getting mosquito bites
And dying from allergies	i have spring allergies yes this would be a problem wait u do too?
It’s really bad in sc but not Boston Should’ve stayed Coronavirus > allergies	offbrand zyrtec sc sounds like a place with lots of pollen
Is painter just fucking immortal? Mf takes on an army base with like 100 armed guards Then gets shot in the chest like 10 times What the fuck. I thought it was annoying the whole movie was gonna be a flashback. But like the flashback wasn’t even real The twist was pretty good tho	Lmfao ikr IKR
How’s your quarantine going?	I wanted to do a bit of work today But no I just made it to episode 9 in the good place I'm so glad u watched the movie haha
I might try to find better days next	I been trying to find it and I basically just suck
Yeah it’s not on the first page of google so it doesn’t exist	LOL EXACTLY
I might end up on Netflix eventually	I told my dad to look for it
*it	Because he can actually read Chinese better than I can And I'm sure it's on some Chinese site somewhere
Did you finish the good place yet?	Yeah I finished the whole thing crie The ending was really good Put me in my feels again
Ok I’m almost there	Ayeeee The last season was very interesting to me
I feel like non of the characters are super likeable yet like jason being dumb is kinda getting old	how far are you jason gets more intellectual i think like a little? marginally idk i watched it all in two days so maybe i just didn't realize i like jason by the end tho
Season 2 ep 8 Maybe it’s a bit early to tell	oh you're not even on season 3 yet LMAO
Yeah I meant to finish season 2 tn but then I played games for 5 hours My friends are home but they don’t wanna go out so just game together ig	LMAO how is this different from a typical weekend for u then eh it's all good i was just binging so i could finish today and look for new things to amuse myself i'm kind of back on my guitar shit again i can't even go out my mom is firm in that i cannot leave until friday i need more show recs now
Wait I get food with my friends and hang out in addition to the hours of gaming You could finish Sherlock	finishing sherlock seems a bit extreme there's a lot of episodes in sherlock isn't there that sounds nice
There’s like 8 episodes left but they’re like 1.5 hrs each	oh hmm ok if i find an easy pirating site i might i kind of want to watch a movie tho cuz like watching the good place ended up taking much longer than i expected
Be the koreaboo you know you are and watch train to busan	omg u know i don't like horror movies it has ZOMBIES
Korean zombies	omg why r u doing this to be i'm not that much of a koreaboo
Hmmmm	tai the movie literally was on netflix, but i think it's only in china that it's allowed
Oh I should’ve bought that ticket to Wuhan then I’ll try a vpn or smth	LMAO i mean the link i just sent is the one pirated from netflix so it shoudlbe just fine
Oh nice Did you get your stuff from the car yet?	i did once i got it tho i was significantly less motivated to actually unpack it
You literally have nothing else to do lol I haven’t fully unpacked either	well somehow i managed to do nothing all day it's so much work to clean it all up i don't have this sort of energy
What if Milo’s latent germs are in there	well shoot u got me there well that's also why i'm not touching it right
Ok so better days wasn’t as sad as I was expecting I felt really bad at times but at least they kinda had a happy ending	Did u cry I cried It was sad But you're right the ending was alright I wasn't sure if it was like one of those parasite things tho where he was actually just like figment of her imagination or smth tho Had to look it up
Surprisingly no but I felt like really sad throughout the movie They almost made it too but that one little push Wei lai or whatever her name was deserved it tho	She was pretty awful yeah I started rewatching this drama called school 2015 and there's a bully in it who is just as bad and I was like oh yeah this is why I don't rewatch this one
Chinese or Korean drama 	korean...
Whatve you been up to with your quarantine over	:(( unfortunately nothing too productive i just wrote up my 8.02 pset i'm supposed to be sleeping early tn so i can actually wake up at a normal time tmrw wbu
I’ve been trying to see my friends more before it gets too serious and we get shelter in place I still haven’t done any work and it’s starting to feel bad Why tho sleeping until like past noon feels good	ehh my motivation comes and goes so i have to use it when i get it we just got shelter in place orders yeah it does but then you get less sunlight and i see my whole family like at odd hours now before they sleep and i'm up for another few hours
True	u finished the good place right what did u think of it
Nah season 4 ep 9 Jason is kinda smarter ig It started to feel a bit repetitive so I took a break But yeah all the main characters are growing on me	Ayweeeee Yes Season 4 is a good one
Brent was awful Am I gonna cry at the end?	eh i did i just like to cry tho ig it was like wistful sad
Big baby	:(( igs
Ok the last episode of the good place kinda got me I teared up a bit when Jason left, when tahani hugged her parents, and when chidi decided to leave It was funny when Jason popped out but sadder when he left again	IKKKKKK so sad so heartwarming i'm glad we finally got to see the good place at the end tho like imagine just waiting 4 seasons to not be able to see the actual good place
Ikr I’m glad we watched it after it finished cause watching it weekly with all the cliffhangers would’ve been annoying	yeah i can't really watch shows that come out weekly that would absolutely kill me 
Was it sarte or smth?	Oh what u know this I had to read the next few pictures to understand it OK but get this Chidi was an ethics professor
Moral philosophy professor here	Surely he had to have heard of sartre In his time on earth Or been able to do research on what hell is So why did Eleanor figure it out first smh Bro literally how did u know
It’s like one of his most memorable quotes and it comes up sometimes in quiz bowl	Whattttt Big brain Idek who this guy was
Maybe cause like what chidi was suffering from in life and the good place didn’t differ too much? And Eleanor is naturally distrusting of people	Lmao i guess so huh
Have you seen Brooklyn99?	noppee i heard it's good tho
Yeah I was thinking about starting it last night Then I realized how much work there actually is	eek my lilst of things to do just keeps getting longer
Do you still have to do stuff for clubs	uh basically no for startlabs wbl we had one meeting but it was dumb hack yes tennis no lmao
What you can’t play tennis on zoom	alas no i wish taiiiiii i have a q for fps 2 is it 3/4
Yeah what’s up	of mu_0 * i /R i'm like so certain that this is right but it's marking it incorrect
It’s not right tho	f whyyyyy
Did you treat the two different sized circles as one	no i did half of one then the other half and summed so like 1/4 + 1/2 were my coefficients isn't it just biot savart
Oh wait I didn’t see the 3/4 you sent It’s 3/8	whatttttttt
Maybe something got mixed up when you squared r? And k hat btw	wait why would u square R
I got 1/4 + 1/8 Cause like	OH SHIT ok yes i'm stupid fffff
 This is pretty good she actually like knows philosophy and stuff and I think she’s from Michigan	LOL NO WAY SHES FROM MICHIGAN????? yessssss OMG SHE ISSSSSS YESSSSS I'm gonna watch this tho
I used to watch these a lot cause they ask good questions	What kind of questions Like u mean philosophy ones
No like some interviews ask dumb shit Like what kind of animal would you be or smth But this show asks stuff where you learn a lot more about the celebrity	Ohhhh Interesting I like that lol i just watched the video that's so cool
When you made the whipped coffee how long did you whip?	lol like 5 minutes it'lll puff up after a while it takes a lot of whipping
Oh i got bored after like a minute And did you use an electric mixer, whisk, or fork	i used a hand whisk lol my hand hurt afterwards from all the whisking bro what persistence
Lmao I’m too fobby I couldn’t find the whisk so I used chopsticks And it was too early in the morning to be persistent it was like only noon	om omfg how r u supposed to get the air in with chopsticks
Persistence	have u seen the 16 and astrophysics urops
Nah why?	oh they just look cool i was going to say if u don't have summer plans yet u should take a look
Yeah the accretion disks in stars one seems interesting but I gotta install linux for it Do you have any summer plans?	dude ubuntu wsl subsytem nopeeee f
English plz F I think misti China is still taking applications 	sorry i didn't even say it right ubuntu is a linux os and wsl is windows subsystem for linux so u can run a linux os on top of windows dude they are and it makes no sense
They haven’t officially cancelled yet so I still have hope	i mean technically we still have a travel ban so even if we get accepted it's not possible
Shhhh Let me be delusional I think I’ve kinda accepted the fact that I won’t be doing anything this summer Cause I made a list of things I’ve been meaning to do for a while and I could do them this summer like learn excel and frontflip and watch the unified lectures and stuff	do u mean like frontflip like actually frontfllip what is unified haha yeah same
Yeah I’m ready to try again after 5 years Like the main classes sophomore year for 16 majors Apparently they’re some of the hardest classes at mit I brushed it off when people said that at first but it kinda hit me how fucked I am if I fail so I’m gonna get ready for them early 6046 is the hardest 6 class right?	oh cool lol what were u doing 5 years ago yeah it's like th ehardest undergrad 6 class
I did a frontflip and landed badly so I like jammed my knee into my teeth I watched a few YouTube videos so I think I’m better prepared this time	holy wow i can't believ u want to give it another shot
Gotta get scars on both knees so its symmetrical	LMAO please no have u done s4 i'm thinking 2*pi*1/2 but i'm too scared to try
I haven’t done it but lemme try it Do you mean pi or 2pi^0.5?	times i'm not sure tho so u should attempt the problem and lmk
Sorry I don’t have time rn I just started a midterm And it’s not pi	bro why r u even responding to me take your midter good luckkk
My friend sent a menu for the food truck we’re going to just after I started so I got sidetracked on my phone Food > grades	omg how was the midterm
It was pretty hard so i hope they’ll be generous with partial credit I regret doing 6.041 I should’ve done the 16 probability class instead	oh it was the 041 midterm? would it have been really different?
Yeah I think the 16 one is a bit easier	oh welp consider it a personal challenge
I took it cause it went towards my major and minor which would be great if I pass it but if I nr it I’ll need to take two classes to make up for it Oof I was kidding when I said I wanted a challenge during the mit interview lol	LMFAO i think you'll be ok
Is 006 the hardest class you’ve taken so far	we just need P's
I think I’m closer to nr tho	i haven't taken any 036 exams yet but i'd say exam wise yeah lol 036 could be a massive shitshow tho
You’ll be fine Wait you have your first exam like 2 weeks before the final	for 036?
Yeah	our midterm was cancelled so our final is just 40% of our grade now i haven't had any exams yet in 036 i just took 006 today
They probably scheduled it after drop date on purpose Was this one easier than the last one	it probably has to be since it's the final noot really lol
Angular freq is 2	yeah lol anjalie just pulled through i didn't wtach the video oop
Grapher	ope is different from oop fyi have u done the 8.02 pset yet
Nope I have 0002 due today and I’m out of late days I think Claire might	oh rip good luck i'll ask her then how did 0002 go
Pretty good it took less time than I thought	:ooo i thought u would be asleep by now
I probably won’t have to do the last pset to pass My sleep schedule is fucked How did your 036 go?	036 exercises got done i had to ask like 3 people but thomas came in clutch that man is a savior and so helpful he even callled me to explain 8.02 lol
He’s so wholesome	truly wait tai aren't u investing in aurora
Yeah rip huge mistake	What no they're up 70% Idk much but they're coming back a bit
Still down like 80% from when I bought in I wanna buy into s&p but it won’t drop	Lol you never know it could go back up

Oh I’m doing my shenzhen one remotely I don’t think MIT is letting students travel for misti so misti set up a bunch of remote internships	oh shit that's cool do they make u speak chinese oh lol i didn't know about that
Thankfully no they were spared You would’ve had to for yours right?	maybe idk actually but both companies had confidentiality concerns so they didn't want to go remote
Rip Hopefully next year then	yeah oop is your thing in shenzhen research
Yeah something like that it’s modeling the musculoskeletal system with different loads	Is this Medicine That's cool tho
Yeah cause I’m premed now	Oh shittt Good luck being in school forever

huh No to not on the server or no i am wrong	Not on the server lol
Oh :3 thank uu thats me rn wait jamie, what prefix argument am I passing to autocomplete	Nothing Since you're just looking for all words right Empty string or tuple Or sentences ig

impossible	mmhm just like your hydro
shhhh Hey Jamie, could u give me a hint on the last test case for deriv, when x = Num(0) and you're doing x.deriv('x).deriv('x) multiple times	you shouldn't be because it's of instance num right so that's a base case
wait so I return 0	uh yeah
am I not supposed	all constants return 0 when u take the derivative of them u should put that inside your num class
wait lemme show u	where r u rn
"in Bakerr def deriv(self, var):
        return 0 thats my method for num"	yeah return Num(0) because it has to be of object type otherwise it's not of type anything and .deriv doesn't even exist
Hehehhee you right :D Where ya at	maseeh 6 lounge the froct is p setting here
froct? wth is that	freshman oct the two quads across the hall my quad
OHhhh What r u psetting	i just finished 009 yuhhhhh
DAMN LEGEND Jeffrey is being a bum eating hot cheetos watching youtube	wait r u with him in macgregor rn cuz he just told me he went to bed oh no jk ur in baker wait he needs to save me some hot cheetos
🤣🤣🤣 wait no way hes going to sleep this early You should attack him tmr	wait wtf the man is 6'1 i'm not attacking anybody anytime soon
wait	no he legit said
you dont realize your quirk	he's going to bed

WAIT NO LEMME EXPLAIN	no this is not ok
okay look you're small you know that girl in deadpool	no i do not wait i haven't watched deadpool 2
shes small but shes a badass look people underestimate you because of your height like how ryan reynold underestimated the negasonic teenager warhead if youre against jeffrey hes gonna underestimate you	yeah but i'm not a bitch
you just gotta use your OP abilities where da fuq did you get that from?	isn't she like teenage hormones during that movie she's so mean i really don't think he does but i don't have any
hypothetically thats the point you dont realize that we actually live in a world of superpowers you just need to nurture and activate your quirk anyways Idk what Im blurting about	yeah me neither
you're not small you're cool period okay I think he actually went to sleep hes MIA	ok thanks yeah i told u!!
Thats never him though... actually he did tell me that he was tired Yo This reply thing is hella weird	he said he was tired after walking in the rain i got it from kevin lol

okieee Im going to my semi so Ill see when I get back Im still doing part 3 so thats fine	Is it hard
I think its harder than the last lab just cause I think its algo-based	Fuvkk
we're implementing adjacency dict graph and adjacency matrix graph	Yeah this is not ok
I never worked with this algo so it took me a while to get it and then theres this graph factory thingy i didnt read that part so welp its over	What is
the cold came	What
from Jeffrey	You're sick?
	Omfg Sorry I'll beat him up for u next time I see him
 PLEASE	Yessir
WAIT JAMIE THIS GUY Coughs on his hand and then when I roast him or w/e he uses his hand TO cover my mouth I just realized how it got passed on  Anyways wanna pset 009 tmr I finished the adjacdncy dictionary part part 3.2 and on ward left! Okie Imma get ready to sleep Nighttt	i'm working on adjacency dict rn have u done the algo for it too
Yeah	shittt i am not even there yet it's so hard
Lmk if u need help I can help u tmr dont stress too much about it	ok thank youuu good night hope u feel better
Nppp cya tme what time do you want to pset?	Now I'm about to go downstairs to eat I was gonna work on MCC east penthouse today if somebody was able to swipe me in but if Baker is quiet we can also go there

Were you able to get the elephants moving around	I haven't checked yet
im sad I dont know how to debug this	LMFAO
I give up	Idek how to help u
Yeh its okay :'(	Lol i haven't really done anything yet
yeh me too, Im just tryna get the elephants to moveeeee	This lab is too complex for me
same no skeleton code = GG	:ppp
:pp I really hope I dont get screwed this week in terms of work too much extracurricular :'(	:pppp Dsmn me too how far r u
huh	with lab
uhmmmm Im not passsing test cases :( so I need to debug	wait i forgot to check my test cases so the whole thing is a mess rn
are u done? long lab, no skeleton code	no sir
OOOF sad lyfe	:pp i'll work on it afgter 042 tody
Okiee Imma skip 042 today cause I need my friend to help me debug why my code for this test case is running slow	:ooo okie
I finishedd	holy shitttt nice
Thankkskks	how do i check for overlap between formations
Uhm  This may help you	ok i'll look thank u
mhmm there are multiple ways to do it	did u render the paths as formations too
but i thought this one clicked to me You can do that I basically made a big rectangle between a pair of path points like an interval per-say and checked if it overlaps	okay that's what i was thinking damn this is gonna take some time
yeah it took me a while from sun - thurs thats all I was thinking about LOL	oh man lol i just started like mon tues
I just cant get checkoff next week cause Imma be gone	barely yeah i see u
You got this lemme know if u need help	T.T okkk thanks thomas
Npppp	My timing is off for the throw interval Like it's throwing late And idk why
you should use the UI to debug and check what timestep it wants the zookeeper to throw maybe something is off with mod equation	wait i fixed that part
oh okie Yayyaya	but now on test case 3-2 it's not creating the zookeeper like idk what is going on
are you using the UI to debug ?	it's saying there's a conflict on the clicks yeah it doesn't help though
youre using ghost mode right	because it's just not spaqning the zookeeper yeah i can see where it's supposed to spawn on ghost mode but it's just not and it's saying there's a conflict
check at what time step it is trying spawn what formation it is comparing the zookeeper with	it's not trying to because there is a conflict
and see if your math works out	like i looked at the input file and both click events throw conflict but they also don't match with the ui
wdym by conflict	lilke the click is on top of a preexisting formation wait can u send me a screenshot of file 3-2.in
wdym file 3-2in	3-2.in on your lab folder it's under cases but the clicks are super wack so i don't know if it makes any sense

}"	wait same but on the ui it's placing the zookeeper in a totally different location wtf
uhmm how is it different screenshot for me so I can see	that's the zookeeper coordinates on the thing
thats where its supposed to mean that means	yeah that's where it's supposed to be
something may be wrong with how you wrote your edge function	but why are the mouse coordinates different
wdym	cuz if i'm goinig to spawn something in that location shouldn't the coordinates be right too like mouse takes a tuple input right it would make sense that the tuple input has a conflict with the rock because the rock is right at 63.5 something
well	this is the code that chhecks for overlap too but it seems right oh wait shit fuckkkk thanks thomas i'm dumb
what happened LOL	do u see the last variable in that function it says obj2.width/2 instead of obj2.height/2 thanks for helping me notice it
Hahha yeah Those small mistakes LOL npnp you caught it yourself Seems like youre almost done!	ok i'm done are there office hours today no right oh shit wait there are
Ayyy good job! LOL Imma just go tmr at 2 PM	lmao i just got it checked off recommend u add docstrings dude made me resubmit cuz of it
Wdym docstring oh I mean what you mean thanks!	Yeah Least I can do lmao
Don't say that you've been a big help other times	Meh Only occasionally Where r the 042 lecture videos Are they online sumwhere
Only occasionally is an understatement ma'am Yeh  Im watching it rn LOL	Tysm Wait these are old lectures they don't record this semesters right
nah	:ppp
DId you do 1b for 042?	Yes I'm not free until 1030 tho
Oki	hey what's up do u still need help
"Yahh How are you upperbounding it and like whats ""c"" for chernoff equation"	depends on what expected value ur using but it's basically some multiple of expected value u use to bound your rv
For for the biased coin, the expected is 3/4n right	the expected number of heads yes but that would give u a lower bound then so think tails
wait why would that give you a lower bound? and how do you calculate for c in that case	because if u wanted your expected number of heads to be > than 5/8 with <= .95 u could have it be like .93 and that would be ok which isn't what u want
oh c has to be bigger than 1	Uhhh Yeah depends on what your e is
did u get something like n=110 for biased? and n >= 165 for fair coin	uhhhh not quite
	i find this really hard to explain over text but essentially
okay go aheadd	what is F
Rv for Fair coin	you need to put it in terms of chernoff's right
yess	so what you have right now says that the probability that i guess incorrectly when i have a fair coin should be <0.05 so that's correct for fair coin
okay	for unfair coin u need to think about what sorts of values would give u an incorrect guess
T is unfair	yes that's right your number should be smth like 208 though make sure u find the right value of c
uhm is it 1.5 for biased	yes
and 1.25 for fair? am i setting it up wrong	i can't remember but i think so? 5/4?
wait why is it 5/4?	that's 1.25 isn't it You set the emoji to .
Isnt ex[t] = 1/4n for tail	i think you're just calculating the wrong value your setup is correct yes
oh no im getting 110 from this setup	that's right for one of them u need to take the higher of the two so calculate the other one
oh its 208 for the fair?	should be u calculate it and let me know
oh okieeeeee THANK UUUU 	yeah ofc
Is it snowwing a lot	not right now but yeah there's a decent amount of snow on the ground it'll be gross within a few days
Darn I miss my chNce for snow really? It gets nasty afterwards?	nah bro snow is overrated trust me yeah dude slush and shit
What are the cons	awful
They loook BEAUTIFUL	wet and cold just do your pset lol had to argue with claire all day about snow
LOOOOOOOOOOOO DED	and then milo threw a snowball at me in my room like they brought up snowballs from outside up the elevator
Oh savages	smh is what it is
Those are real friends	ig so
Thats when you can call them bros	i been called everybody bros
Now you gotta get revenge	nah i'm ok too lazy

Hbu?	Nothing Nothing And some more nothinf
Thats good Oh there were quite a decent amount from start lab like 8-9m whats ur plan for the weekend	Oh nb It's mostly just social stuff
Damn Lit	6042 review Ig
^^ Yeah i think thats the same for me prob cram physics	Ye
since I havent looked at it	Lmao basically same
U should watch the Mandalorian if you havent	What's it about
Baby Yoda	Oh Uhhhhh I dont reallY like star wars
Damn The Departed Check out the trailer	Okay fine I will later tonight Gotta fold laundry rn
Did you watch it	from 2005?
yeh	i don't get it
wdym	the appeal lol i also have a tendency to not watch old movies
:/ its good The idea is that The police is tryna expose a mafis group cause they believe they were the cause of prior killings but they have no evidence.	did u just watch it today
The police sent an undercover police to be in the mafia at the same time	wait no i got the gist of it
the mafia had already trained someone clean to be a police oh okay	i just don't know if i should watch it
Its good I watched it last week? Def a good movie	haha ok fine maybe
Dont worry I tend not to watch old movies but this was pretty good	lol ok i'll trust u and try to watch it after finals tho
HEHE YAS Yeh def when r u going back home?	the 17th midday
Oh lit niceee	yeah it really is i'm excited
Thats good! no more pset	when r u going home
FOR 6 WEEKS	yeha ikr
16th	oh wait
at night	i'm coming backk on the 5th
Oh oof	yeah lmao
But no pset doe	oh true
Ur just working	i'll forget what it's like to have a pset arguably harder lmao
Probably Gotta get them $$$	gotta get the return offer is what u mean
Oh right definitely Build up the resume	lmao are we being too preprofessional right now career oriented>
No not at all I was just going to mention how awesome ot would be to be a bartender I would love to spend a summer learning how to make magaritas	wait that would be kind of cool but also like
🤣🤣🤣	wouldn't it be weird and like random dudes would def get drunk and just ugh i can't even imagine
Well why would you focus on that person?	well no that's not the point the point is that it's not an easy job and u have to deal with shitty people
Thats good though You build a lot of tolerance for people	yes but
Makes life easier in the long term if you have to deal with shitty ppp	i'm more referring to getting harassed which i think
Oh	u weren't getting
I didnt get that point Well one thing you can do is stand up for yourself and refuse to make drinks for them :)	lol ok thomas
Okok its a scary situation but depends where you bartend	yeah true ig but i'm just thinking of how shitty it must be to be a bartender with poor conditions like that
Ah got it I dont think it occurs often I believe in good people tbh I feel like movies exaggerate the shitty view of the world and make it seem as if this type of stuff occurs on a daily basis, which I dont think is the case at all	thought u were from the ghetto ok wait objectively this stuff does occur on a daily basis much more frequently than u imagine the world isn't a bright and sunny place and that's just in the US
Wow I didnt know	i just learned that stat too but yeah it's quite high people are douches in general idk like me personally i don't feel super like unsafe going places alone unless it's like dark but i feel like a lot of guys wouldn't even think that a girl might feel that way because it just doesn't like occur to them why they might be scared
Nah I get you Im scared of the dark	LOL big guy like u scared of the dark
scared yes	okay fair
When i was a kid	anybody can be
I needed the hall way light	i mean
otherwise i cant sleep	what was scary about the dark
also outside i was scared of getting jumped and the number of  homeless settlements is huge in sj we have a terrible system	damn
but i generally agree with how guys dont think about the fact some girls can get sexually assaulted even if its subtle its okay if I had a daughter I would be extremely cautious until i teach her how to step her foot if something like that happens	well the point is that it's not her fault but unfortunately she'd have to be cautious because that's how the world is rn the ultimate goal is to get to the point where she doesn't have to be cautious because nobody should have to feel scared of getting like fucking assaulted
Yeh thats what I meant	yeah idk it just like pisses me off
Well the 1900s was extremelt patriarchal I think what hit me regarding this topic was the Stanford swimmer incident holy fuck Bs judge	wait was that the brock whatever wait i can't remember
yeh	damn yeah i can't even say more it's just dumb
i admire chanel (the victim)'s courage on writing her book to spread awareness 	oh fuck she did? damn
yeah well good talking to you hopefully everything is fine on your end. if anything is troubling you, let me know maybe i can help	lol no i'm completely fine i just u started talking about bartending and i thought of that
Oh right 🤣🤣🤣	I'm actually going to go to AAA tosay But Not at 1 I am still in bed rn Oh fuck it's beautiful Save me some
come thruuu	I have to wake up first bri
okok ill save some	Yeassssss
There is a lot	Yayyy
You missed a call from Thomas.	oh hey what's up
when r u walking to the review	oh mb i just saw this we left a little late and then couldn't find seats lmfao
Its all goood	There's no all team today right
Nope	Oh cool Is your bike accessible over iap by any chance
i think so it should be in the baker bike rack do you remember how my bike looks like? the left pedal is halved black ish Only one metal lock password is 0127	Is that right outside or around back Wdym halved Black right Oh bless I was worried it was gonna be a key Thanks thomasss
its inside the thingy Like my pedal os broken	What's the thingy Oh that's okay as long as I can still use it
the Baker's cage	bro there's a cage?
yeah	how am i supposed to get inside it then
Ask Jeffrey he knows where it is It's unlocked	isn't it only for residents oh cool
Sick Its a mountain bike so the tire should be pretty noticeable	oiiiii that's dope
Yeh Lmk if you end up finding it	i should be able to
aight	 oh wait you're on IR well if u have time please help
 okie	oh tanks
Yo are you nearby so I could grab my bike?	I'm about to go to a meeting  but I'll be back in around half an hour
okay	Sorryy How was your break
All good! It was wholesome and fun Yours?	I'm back now I was home to just over 2 weeks P solid time Seems ages away now You called Thomas.
Are you going to lecture	Oh right Where is it
Im still in Baker but apparenty its in building 32	I can be ready by the time you're here
Okay	Should we go to the first half and see how it is
yeg im here	That is a lie
im srs	I'm standing  outside THOMAS WANT TO MENTOR THIS SATURDAY FOR BLUEPRINT ASK YOUR BAKER HOES TOO
you going to lecture?	Yes
yo jamie how would we catch the case of merging intervals	merging?
Yeah do see you the first two blocks how its adjacent it basically merged Nvm I got it 	> ?
Merging two intervals if same number of room	Well they have an hour in between so we can't even
well if they are adjacent right you want to merge that thats an edge case I got my code to work iteratively keheh	Was it basically the same way we discussed it Lmao nice
We just forgot that edge case So like	Well when we wrote the pseudocode we didn't talk about merging
yeay	But merging u do after righg
yeah process it after	OK cool but for that particular edge case do we need to do like Increase the second tuple rooms by 1
No	So they don't have the same number of rooms
its the same	Like this ex
like if u have (2,1,3) (2,3,5) you merge	(2,0,2) (2,3,4) Right
(2, 1, 5)	But what about my case
no dont merge for ur case it has to be adjacent	Right but Adjacent tuples don't need to have different room numbers right It's only for adjacent time perioda Not tuples right
Wdym	Like it's okay that (2,0,2) (2,3,4) is in the booking right Even tho there are two 2s next to each other
Yeah Thats okay	Okay awesome
But yeah should save u a lot of time 	I think I have all the pseudocode down I'll write it up tn
Yeh	Can u help me with #4 later today
Yeah of course Hmu Im free	Okayyy :D
When r u done with class I prob want to finish writing it up after physics	i'm done at 12pm but i have to be in stata until like 4pm
Okay Chill I can help after 4	sure
Do yu still need help	with 4? yes if u havve time
Yeah where to meet called you.	wait i picked up can u not hear me
Nope	whee do u want to meet up to u
Ug Uh	i'm on maseeh 6 rn
Oh Im in Baker	working on num 4 lmao
U wanan cone yo Baker  There are mor windows in Baker	lol r u sure there are more windows in a bit then i'll try num 4 by myself for a little longer and anjalie is here and knows too
Dammit Ill come thru	LMAO u don't need to srsluy
I actually needa ask about 1	oh ok
Okay cya there gotta hit up meeting	is this your pset? thanks but how did u get to n^4 from that summation
yeah this is mine it converges to a constant right?	yes but i'm trying to calculate that constant and there's an n term in the top of the sum
Oh I didnt calculate that	so i wasn't sure
You dont need to if u graph (3/4)^x it goes to 0 so its gonna be a constant	yeah ok hmm
or geometric series of infinity thats 1/(1-r)	hmm ok
could ya open Yo When we run the perceptron function, how do we know when the mistakes converge for 1 3 `.3 1.3 1.C***	just run different iterations until u get about the same #
you want the exact theta? Im confused cause theoretically I got about 8910693 mistakes	no like you'll get a theta but it'll also print the # of mistakes
I feel like getting 60 for theta after 100 iterations is weird... I think Im doing something wrong The separator is [0,1,0.5] for the data so Im supposed to expect my theta to be somewhere that right	yeah but the number of errors says 200 is this hw 1
this is hw3	oh
the part you finished	uh why don't u just use the perceptron they give u
wait I am...	uhhh wait this is better to see in the collab notebook just run everything in order and change your data and labels to match the data and labels on hw
isn't it matched :o	in the beginning it is
wdym	like in the collab notebook initially they set data and labels to smth but later on the questions ask about different data and labels
yeah we add 1 to all of our data right okay I think I got it holu fuck i thought idea factory was today im livin'	Lollll
did u do 5.d for 036	Don't think so
Okie thankss	We should pset today Does 4pm work for u

Yehh	:ooooo
🤔🤔	i finished it last night no worries was jank but i did it
ayyy gratzzz	lol thanks all work is a struggle
It truly is	:(( i have had exactly 0 amounts of motivatoin to do anything
its okay we are all in the same shoe Its really not fun tbh Thats why you gotta play games LOL	:(( yeah but i'm not good at video games
Does your brother play games?	yes lol
play with him! wait there are games like maplestory which isn't hardcore	how can stare a computer screen all day and not feel tired
LOL Because You're having fun whereas when I study I get tired within 30 minutes	omg but the computer screen
dude your room is pretty dark maybe thats why its affecting your eyes?	it's not that dark but like i get tired from sitting in the chair all day
Awh I see	i tried to plank today and could only do like 30 seconds
Thats good! Wait honestly go little by little dude	lol i used to be able to do like 1.5 minutes i just got fat
Nah its more so of losing the muscle for it	oh yeah that too both
So if you do 4 sets of 30 sec plank the first day and increase the duration by 5 seconds so second day would be 4 sets of 35 secs 15 seconds rest in between You will def go back yo 1 minute and 30 secs	wow you're like my personal trainer this is great i should lol
"Okay you should start off with 4 rounds of:
10 situps
30 seconds plank

30 secs rest in between set between rounds* lmk how that small workout feels and if you want more lmk"	oooh ok i'll try that
aight sweet yo my dude could you send me an html file of lab 9 for 6036 i wanna start on it early cause i scheduled an advisor meeeting during my lab hours LOL	lol did u declare a major yet content is static so the loading bar isn't going to go away unless u go into the html and comment it out also my answers on it lmao
okay thank youu No I have my meeting with my advisor on Friday But prob 6-9 hbu?	oooooh i declared 6-3 a while back lol
Oh LOL	i can change it whenever right
yeah how come?	yeah so it's chill i just want a fancy shmancy course 6 advvisor lmao nah i just figure i'll either be 6-3 or 6-2 i'll figure out a minor/double later if i want
wait when did you declare	like a week or a week and a half ago a few days after it came out
wait if we declare 6-9 do you think ill get a course 6 advisor as well wait this html file doesnt work fk	no clue wdym have u tried chrome
i just get a blob of text	uhhhh
like no css	lol it shouldn't be doing that
yeah	the content on the page is dynamic so i had to download it as a complete html file if i download it any other wya no content will appear on the screen
yeah i thought it would show the whole content	it's possible that it's your browser/device macs are weird that's the lastway i can try to send it but i have my doubts
no bueno	what's the error there
I think its missing the css lemme see if theres a chrome extension that just ss the whole page 	here's the complete rendering unzip the folder and open the html oh i need to email u the zip
LOL	fb isn't letting me send it
ok thomasngo05@gmail.com	i sent it to your mit email the things i do omg
HAHA thank you wait dude html? wait i got it ur a g thanks	you just need that file of stored content so u can render the html file properly
Yeah makes sense hows 036 going for u	it's a super annoying class lmao i hate doing matrix stuff
LOL I agree with u I hate figuring out the dimensions lmao I also hate how I totally dont know anything after I do the homework	yeah the homework is just like figurin gout how to make the numbers fig fit
LOL facts dude studying for the exam is gonna be a 50/50 besides hw, how ya doing? e.g, looking forward to summer at the very least?	:(((( it's actually read bad idk anything lmao no i don't have anything to do over the summer yet looking for a job is rough atm did step get turned virtual
LOL finals gonna be hard asf yeah step became virtual Damn how about that job u said in China?	well i turned that down for smurf and then smurf got cancelled besides it's china
its china?	yanno covid
I see	not to say that it's noot worse here rn but traveling is like so bad
but virtual?	besides i already turned it down s
wouldnt that be possible hit them up with the email LOL	so i can't go ask for it back bro and get blacklisted forever? idk about that one
What they would blacklist you?	they wanted me there in person in the first place which is why i couldn't even do it for a little bit during august because they need me there for in person training or whatever it is either way
Oh I see	it's not gonna work out on tha tend lol
Wait whats with August?	smurf was originally supposed to go june-july
oh	rip lmao
well theres virtual urop	yeah i'll probably email some profs about that tomorrow or smth
Haha its okay get ready for MIT to drop the news that we're going online fall time to find internships for fall	lol i doubt any companies will be running internships at this point
tbh work for startups	crie
min wage LOL	i'm gonna take a gap year lmfao a gap semester
oh just a gap semester? yeh I would take a gap semester also	well presumably we'd be back by iap
I wanted to do GTL but I have no idea if we are gnna have the fund for that this IAP LOL	lol yeah oof
Dude I am so brainless with what projects I can do	oof don't even get me started i have 0 motivation rn i want to do nothing
its okay thankfully MIT has enough work to keep me busy for at most 4 days aight imma play somee games	lol wait literally the amount of work i have for school is kind of ridiculous i'm not even in a free enough state to be mass applying for jobs okie goo
wait what the fuck whats keeping you occupied?	lol doesn't 8.02 take up a massive amount of time for u i'm also in final project mode for 6.08 rn this paired with the fact that i have zero motivation is just like OOOFOFOFOFF
oh yeah I heard 6.08 final projecet is time consuming	i just don't wanna do work tho lmao i'm just lazy
8.02 is okay I think	bro there's so many learning sequencesssssss and i'm not even learningggggggg from them
wait I feel like these learning sequencs are pretty good better than lectures LOL	wait in lecture i don't have to answer questions with a limited number of tires i used to do my other homework in that class wtf ridiculous!
LOL Bruh this past learning sequence I bascially F all of them	lmfaoo yeah wait i stopped reading the questions properly and was so frustrated when i got 1/3 on one of the questions and then i realized i was looking at the object moving in the literal opposite direction so fucking stupid lmao this is my mental state i'm not living it up
LOL You should read manga	i read the three body problem when i was still motivated for book club
Wait Read Tower of God Its a web toon	oh soorry the three body problem isn't a manga i just thought of that but i feel like i've heard of that i'm actually reading like 3 webtoons concurrently rn

"whats ""tmr morning"""	other than midway i'm good i can do 11am edt oh thats too early for u
yeh I wake up at 10 LOL HAHHAA so 1 PM edt	how about 3pm edt we have midway 1-3 i
wait	ll probably have to be there for hack and wbu at startlabs
im at 2 for midway edt yeh we can do 3 edt	excellent aight cool
Imma finish whatever I can finish this lab seems awful	yeah actually lol so long and we have 006
^ yup	so it's just like fucked
yeah for sure i want to get rid of this so i can study for 006 LOL	:((( oh good idea
i have a 4 hour movie to watch by Tuesday as well and learning sequence and exercise for 036 holy fuck im so screwed this weekend	wtf for acting? that's ridiculous
yeh hamlet it seems like a good movie so Imma watch it	oof yeah i did those ahead of time for s1 and s2 so i can help with those if u need
LOL	omg why can u pick a shorter one
no she assigned it to us aight ill hit u up if Im really screwed	oh f ok sure
okay im on the second to last im so stuck i sent a piazza post to see if they could help this lab is too much for me	Ooif really? I'm almost done with 2 Will continue to work on tiday
okay I finally finished lmk if u need help	Omg Ok I'm on 4 now Just made it
niceee	Well just started 4
ull finish this lab tbh is like so rigged compared to last weeks could you run down the answers for me for Learning Sequence 1 & 2 at some point i really dont want to do physics	Yeah is it due tuesday
yeh	I might not have time until 11pm tn 8pm for u
yeh thats fine Ill be working all day	OK gr8 Oh boi Take some time for yourself too
yeah + league in between but the plan is to catch up with work r u free to slide in the ans :D	Ooh yes I'm still upstairs washing up bc I need to do it all before my parents go to sleep But I'll be going back downstairs in a big Bit
okie dokie	q/C q/C*dq Q^2/C/2 nearly zero E/2R E/2R & 0 0 and E/4R R*C -ln(1/2)*tau s2: 0 & #/4R e/4R* E/2R & 0 -IR/L I_0*(e^(-t*R/L)) .4I_0 L*I^2/2 decreases -I^2*R (-I*R)/L
wow tyvm life savior	yep
did u do the exercise for 036 yet if not u wanna run it down rn?	it's not even out yet right i'm still doing the hw how do represent the summation in the value iteraation
no its out uh what problem is this	i don't understand how to use transition model and transition model.expectation like 5.2
lemme go to my thingy	tanks
so transition_model returns a DDist instance	yeah
.expectation allows you return the value over a current distribution thats basically the sum	what do u call expectation on tho
so	it requires some function f idk what that means
yeh that one was a pain in the butt remember the value function you created	what the fuck f ok
wait before you get more bug so you want to write like a lambda function that uses the value function because the value function requires two inputs	ohh
"and expectation will pass in different ""s"" states"	lmao uhhhh uhhhhhhh
lmk if i was confusing i can re-explain	wait so how do i pass in the a
so remember that value does that it loops through all of the actions as long as you pass in your q instance	so i should pass in old the q right
yupp lambda s: value(q, s) bruh thru this lab, i finally understand how to use lambda LOL	LMAO
and list comprehensions	dude
holy shit	wait so its reward + discount * transitionalmodel(s,a).expectation(value func) right
uh should be expectation(lambda s: value(q,s)) unless thats what u mean	yeah that's what i mean but i keep getting got = 0.0 for one of the ks
ks?	the test dict i thiknk my only other problem may be the checking for epsilon
here thats their solution mine doesnt fit in the box but i think u got the idea move on to the nexgt its almost 1 AM	oh fuck what is this get thing i've been using value to decide when to return
Haha I was gonna ask if u were using set yeah watch out for that same idea for the next one pretty stupid	wait i don't get it tho
wdym	isn't the value at the s, a the value so why can't i call the value diff on it
huh wdym by value diff	like i'm doing value(q, s)  - value(new_q, s) after it iterates through all a's but you're checking every action too
wait lmk see ur code so ik what ur talking about	oh oop i fixed it already but i think maybe i understand it's because i'm not checking the max s,a i'm checking the value at that moment q,s
yeh since u want the max val of that state	yeah alright i'm almost there
sick	1 more section baby let's get this bread
u got this dude	tomorrow i have to start studying for 006 f i hope i can get this done tn
me too i can hit u up sol if u need it tbh i dont think the last section is that important as long as ur pseudocode is there the rest if just debugging until ur using the right stuff	okie thanks thomas i'll give it a shot down to do the exercises now still don't understand the horizons exactly lol but it sort of makes sense
oh u finished?	yeah
sick okay i just started	aight
u only need to watch q learning on lecture	dude u want me watch lecture before doing these????
🤣🤣🤣 nvmmm LOL	rip if i can't get it easily i'll just cry
LOL Okay lets see	and be sad that i have to somehow do them tmrw when i'm supposed to be studying
okay i rlly dont want to do this	lmao same
ok i finished	yep me too it wasn't that bad once i got in the hang of it lmao i didn't code it tho it was easier to just keep track on paper
yeh 6006 time goodluck man	eeeek i'm going to bed
nightt dude	gngn thomoas thomas want to help out a friend on 3d on the 036 exercises
.-. i didnt start	aiyoooooo
i totally forgot	start now
gg	i'm almost out of tried
okay	aiayoo
what have u tried	also have u done the 8.02 sequences yet
Nope I need to do that	i've tried 1001 1010 and 1101 for 3d rip
have u	i'm trying to do them now but i'm at 2/3 submissions for one of the q so i'm waiting for claire to get back to me
Yup DAMN claire is gnna carry	lol hope so
Wait were anynof ur submissioks partial credit	for what
3d	no so i'm assuming they didn't give like some of them u can deduce
fuck	based on what percent they give u
i have 3 left	but they were all just 0% ripppppp
i tried all 4 and just 3	holy lmao
uhm idk if i shud read	ok don't try it yet i'm thinking
lmao okay	okay the only reasonable answer i see left is 1000
LOL	but don't try it yet wait until u get there and see if u agree w me
okay did u read	no but after i got to 3d and kept getting it wrong i skimmed the notes and it was useless lol the rest u don't need the notes for
okay imma skim so we can vet 3d down okay its 1 0 0 0 like u said	damnnnnnn
do u wanna hmu with the rest of it ;3	ye 011 111 001 1 (w*x_1+x_2-y_2)*x_1 + (2*x_1*w + x_2)*(w*(w*x_1+x_2)+x_3-y_3) ^would recommend actually bashing that one out none 1,1,1.5
bashing?	like solving the derivative 0110 and then u know the last one
thanks bro Yeah Imma study this at night how far r u on in the learning seq	3 more on s1
did u do the capacitor of radius r	uh maybe? send pic f i'm on that rn
damn F	i've already tried alll 3 combinations where they're the same
bruh me too i have 2 attempts left LOL	omg
I dont get it	i'm actually trying to solve it now
like shouldnt B(c) > B(d)	so wait 2, 6 claire came through
wtf	dude same
this doesnt make sense lmao yo for Electric field chaning part c did u get that one I tired 1 and 3 answers either 2 or 4	i haven't solved b yet bro
2pir wait no B2pir	the fuck oh why tho
because ur given B and ur loop is 2pir	oh what does that have to do with e
wdym e?	it's 4 for c like why doesn't B field have anything to do with E allso i don't understand c
like u mean the relation between B and E?	yes
i think in this case, we were just finding the magnitude but in general	it's +k right for d oh
idk i needa read part c cause I dont understand it LOL wow thats a stupid question	shit this one's so long
"""assumed"""	i gtg eat dinner now
okiee did u get d?	hoping you'll come in clutch later no i'm scared lol
Hopefully okay fk	it's only 1 try
Ill pull the trigger	so i'm tryna think ok well ig u can do that too
or think lmao	i feel like it's +k just cuz rhr i'll pull the trigger it's +k
LOL damn og	trusty friend i'll be back
aight Ill try to do the rest	see u soon thanks i'll ask u for help
bruh we gotta finish SQ 2 then we're done lmao	dude this actually suckssss i'll be back tho
yeh fosho E_z*pi*r^2	savior ok byeee
epsilon_0*a*c*e ^(a*t)*pi*r^2 mu_0*epsilon_0*a*c*e ^(a*t)*pi*r^2/(2*pi*r) h. 2/4 im stuck on the last question	OK I'll take a look in a bit I've got a meeting from 730 to 9 But tn
aight	what have u tried for the last quesiton arleady on s1
yeh i ended up getting it did u get it	No I didnt I don't really understand
lemme see b and c	do you have any insight for me
okay so its a pretty stupid question imo but its just how B and E are related in terms of like the two maxwell equations u have faradays law and ampere-maxwell equattion so B and E can be represented differentt ly	wdym by represented differently and like i don't understand how this follows rhr and how does the change in B or E field induce some other thing
okay called you. -A*b^2*t^2*sin(b*x*t) -A*b^2*x^2*sin(b*x*t) 12*A*(x-v*t)^2 12*A*v^2*(x-v*t)^2 called you. yo jamie can you explain 2 for me when ur free	Yeah for sure
okie dokie and 4 too LOL	haha yes are u planning on going to oh for 3
yeh prob rn	will u let me know how 3 goes i can explain 2 and 4 to you at 9pm
yeh ofc 9pm edt?	yes 1hr
 called you.	I think I get it Do u want to leave
sure	Ok Do u w ant to call I can explain
ye The video chat ended. yo	What's up I'm about to go to sleep
Oh Answer this tmr whats our original solution to 3	Ok
lol	Oh it's just R(x0 0 0 0)
why is a b c = 0 i get i=0 so this problem is suffix we are going from n to 0	Because u add the current value to each of the subset tracker parameters As u proceed Will explain more in depth tmrw
okay so there are m^3*n subproblems right O(1) work	Yes
sick lmk when u can explain 4	ok let me do my project writeup for 6.08 real quick then we can talk
okie	4pm edt ?
yeh sure rdy?	yes
The video chat ended. 	can u try 4 for me on the 036 exercises problem 1
its 4 do u want the rest of the problem?	yes nice
ok	i'm doing the rest wait no i don't need it
oh	i'm doing the last q rn
okay	i'll ask if i can't do it
okie dokie did u take the physics quiz yet	nope did u tbh i'm a lil nervous lol do we need to know slab and toroid derivations and shit
nope i dont think so Imma study a bit and take it lmao	LOL ok i will too then i'll get it over with so i can study for 006 ig
LOL facts imma start studying for 036 this week	is it just dp on this week's quiz
realized its next friday big L yeh DP	oh f please don't remind me they haven't even posted study materials
theyd id	what
its all on tthe final exam section of lms so time to get crackin on those practice exams LOL	oh f lol i didn't even know
yeh I looked into it yesterday	holy shit there's so much dude i hate this fucking class such a wast eof time
rlly how come	i just think as long as u knwo it conceptually the math doesn't really matter unless you're like getting intot actual ml theory and stuff dude the final is 25 pagfes holy also none of us know shit about these equations ffffff i think i need to quit while i'm ahead lol
LOL WTF Yeh bruh the final is all conceptual I forgot 80%	wait no i looked at some of the stuff on it
of ch. 1-10	and like we have to calculate q values
oh	what's ch 1-10 oh everything we learned before we came home
yeh	rip
thank god its open notes so i dont have to force myself to remember the equation	i didn't want to spend that much time on this but i guess i'll be going back through all the lecture notes and copying equations down into a notebook
I see	i guess if 006 doesn't come for me first 036 will
006 is last for me lmao	also why do we have a frickin final in 006
Burh i heard previous semesters they didnt have a final LOL	like the three quizzes have already covered all the material bruh like in 004 and 009 we don't have finals just 3 quizzes
yeh	that cover all material what's the point of a final again ridiculous
to fuck us again to ensure we know the material back to back	dude i didn't learn shit from any of my mistakes on quiz1 and quiz 2
HAHAHAH	still haven't looked at answer keys rip
Yeh same Imma do that to study	ffffff
look back at my mistakes so the probabilities that i make those mistake are reduced by a factor of 10%	:((( if u don't get the graph right we still aint' getting efficiency or correctness points
if you get your augmentation wrong you automatically get 0 pt if you get ur relation wrong, you get 0 pt	fffffffasaz literally
thats basically the grading	:(
welp gl with ur study ma'am	yes good luck to you too have u done 8.02 yet
the sequences?	yeah
yeh did u need something	no i got it
okie dokie	So there's no nearest neighbors on it right
nope	I've spent like 3 hours on the first 13 questions of the first practice exam L lmao
Thats good pacing 🤣🤣🤣	please don't do this to me i'm having a crisis lol
awhh okay	on that note do u understand this
Nope I skipped that problem	oh oof lol
weird notation really weird	yeah i don't understand the double brackets
skip skip skip	lol nice
Bruh these questions are too tiring Imma finish thr final review and go thru 2 tests at most and call it a day good luck to u and dont add too much on urself	yeah i don't think i can go through more than this one test haha i haven't even done anything yet i'm so confused by this material
Yeah me too Its really different	it's not really anything like what we've learned imo so i feel like i'm experiencing entirely new mateiral
definitely not tbh I feel like i gotta memorize how to solve these problems 🤣🤣 like ap testing	eek nothing can save me now
its fine u aint alone Almost done eith the semester and we become SOPOHMORES LOL	bitch i'm not ready
ducks to suck	really does lol the last few questions on the final review are all useless cuz they're all on nearest neighbors and decision trees right
Oh if so we're chilling I havent looked at it yet I got up to like problem 10	lol nice dude just looking at the questions takes up like half my brain power then the other half is the solutions
LOL I relate thats why I havent started yet I refuse to start	hahah i feel this on such a level it literally hurt me to look at anything today
do you get 2.2	I just tried directly calculating it And then guessed
i see okie dokie	Yeah basically if they're the same it's like (1,1)
yeh that makes sense	yeah it's really time consuming tho i don't know how'd i do it under time limit
Ugh yeah Its okay I think we will be able to think faster under pressure or just skip the problem 🤣	uhhhh that has literally never happened to me on a 006 quiz under pressure i think at least 5x slower
 Kinda true I start sweating	damn me too
Then my brain gets tired and requests for a 24 hour break mid test	eek u know it
bro dont u think downloading the pdf and doing it by hand is much faster?	hi yes lol
r u gnna do that	i don't have a pencil or anything tho so i can't even if i wanted to
oh Im prob gonna do it thru notability	i ordered a remarkable but that's not coming until august LOL
"LOL i have ocd of writing ""theta"" partial x / partial theta thats so weird"	ugh i'm annoyed i wish i could do it too typing sounds like a pain i wish i had one lol
:'(	hopefully there's not too much like that
Yeh	doubt it tho
hopefully did u do another practice test yet	how's the studying going
didnt start LOL	i did the midterm review
played my 2 games of league for the day LOL	the midterm material is either repeated in final review or easier so i would just look at the final material if i were you
oh I did midterm review I just finished final review yesterday	so you're farther than me lol
no we're on the same page you finished both midterm and final review, correct?	yeah just finished the midterm review the final review was really confusing tho
Oh def	so i'll probably have to come back tot hat at some point
Midterm made more sense to me LOL	it was all the easier material lol q learning is gonna fuck me over
im literally grateful that we dont need to learn nearest neightbor and the non parametric model otherwise i would have cried	yeah lol there were a lot of quesitons that got crosses out on the midterm review that were about that so i was very thankful
yeh crazy im gonna be on edge this week last minute studying for all exams	this week is almost over lol
oof	same i haven't even started studying for 9.00 which is also this friday
LOL bruh ur wildin'	over the weekend i have to cram 8.02 and 006 oof
same	same as u am i tho lol
Imma aim for a C in 8.02 i need that 62	LOL
i hate that class with a passion i gotta study 6.006, 18.02, 8.02 next week so things should be interesting	oh shit you got a lot on your plate
it'll be a ride cant wait for the grind day by day so far i think the recent exam materials are much different feel like they're more application based questions	Wdym by that Apparently Leslie kaebling actually taught the last semester and she was actually good
yeah her videos are really good idk theyre just diff stories there u go there is a story just like 6.006	Lol what Is that better or worse
Good questiom idek anymore Im so tilted By my 18.02 professor he wants me to wake up in time for a 9 am exam boston time	uhhhhh what
this man is a savage	that's awful wow best wishes
thanks bruh	:D
do you know why this is O(V^3) I thought E = O(V) for sparse graph	No clue Let me look at this after 036
Okie	Good luck bb
Good luck to u 2 3 hours oof	Lol yerp Rip my brain
Me too Imma play one game of league to warm up my brain just woke up oof	LOL what OK whatever floats your bkat
rip lost the game	Lol that's OK
grades for 036 came out if u didnt know	Oh I didn't know Is there somewhere we can see our total score Oh it's at the bottom of progress? Is that accurate
Yeah	oh i see how'd it go for you i went back and looked at some of the questions i got wrong and don't really get it but whatever lmao
it was okay wait we can check our work? with solutions?	There's no solutions but some of the questions say how many points u got
oo tyty	Yee
Good luck with ur next few exams	thanks thomas :pp 8.02 tmrw
Yaaah dude	:// i'm over it
whats up? oh 8.02?	yes lol i'm so over this clas
bro u studying for 6.006	not relaly
nani	wbu i should be
aboutta start	but i just had a call oh what nice
I was gonna ask if we should just create a room	yeah whats up
and chill ;3 with everyone else LOL	zoom room ? rn?
maybe in a bit	idk i'm just doing practice exams and like need it to be kind of quiet
oh I see nevermind then :3	hahah i'm sorry thomas we should call after 006 tbh i'm a little crazy rn
LOL Pretty much why we should call and chill and relax before the exams hit up the whole squad :3	whY relAX before??? cannot relax rn
MENTAL BREAK DUH 	i've been mental breking for the last hour lol
oh haha	eek i'm just not gonna think about it
its okay its just 3 hours and then theres the summer	Agree Endgame
 Bro ITS OVER UR A SOPHOMORE	HAHA HI it went by too fast nahhh i don't wnat to be
SHAT	that's 1/4 gone
ARE U HAPPY NOW THAT SCHOOL IS OVER 🤣🤣	a little tho yeah huge relief
what the a LITTLE? dont tell me ur doing more work	i'm in a urop lab meeting rn LOL so yeah i guess i am how's the internship going
jamie what the fuck	"it's not even my choice my urop prof is just very ""enthusiastic"""
No you tell him that school ended so ur brain is hibernating for the next 2 weeks	LOL i literally can't
My internship starts next month	i told him i won't start until june 1 tho so i have a week oh yay nice
Ayyyy whats the lab about	NLP for new bias tegmark lab
Thats funny I also emailed him a month ago for a part time position 	oh really? he wants fulltime urops tho won't ur internship be very busy tho
Yeah ik he said no HAHAHA Well that was the time when I felt ambitious you see 🤣🤣	eek it's ok he's a lot lol being ambitious is good!
Hahha hes funny thats a rllly cool urop though  what else r u planning over the summer	haha thanks i hope it's not like that much tho i want some time to do like personal deevlopment stuff this summer too just like my own learning maybe the social spotify project
personal development? the social spotify project is coooooool	you should hop onnnnn
I amm	u didn't apply for sandbox!!
I was confused no one replied in the chat so i was like oh i guess no one is doing it 	oh yeah i texted alex about ti separately i think we can still add u
Yeh I talked to alex	yeah just like
Its okay I just want to help	things i want to do for myself like i want to learn react and make a personal website
Ooo	write more on my blog learn guitar
Hold up Im driving we can catch up thru call if ur down	i'm still in my lab meeting don't text me if you're driving
wait ur in ur urop meeting	yes zoom
no im aboutta drive 🤣🤣	oh wherea ya going
ill catxh up with u later	aightt
my cousins house to use her weights	LOL on the grind
now i am I havent been doing it dude	i'm impressed with your spirit
huh wdym dude i qant to learn react too	yeah rip this lab is gonna take off years of my life f
LOL I was gnna ask u what do you think some of 004 materials were important	Which topics? Are like important to general use? Like none of it it's just interesting
Idk I want to take 6.033 but I dont want to take 6.004	ohhhh isn't 004 a prereq tho
yeah 	what r u gonna do to get around that
I was hoping to skip it haha cause I could use 6.033 as a CI M for 6-9	idk some course profs will kick out kids that don't satisfy prereqx tho even if u get past your advisor idk if you'd like 033 tbh like 004 is like dip your toes in
Rlly  System design though	hmm maybe idk what you're intersted in it's all like low level computer design i think it's not a bad thing don't be sad i just don't know
Yeh Ill see my interest will prob change Wait how bad is 004 compared to 036 Did u feel like you learned a loy	036 is worse imo cuz of the mindless derivatives i def learned stuff i never knew before it's like not so useful for writing code but i def think you learn a lot about how computers work which is like base foundational stuff
Oo I sde Okay Ill just ponder it a bit more Is your UROP a lot of work?	i ididn't know it was a ci-m though i think it might be
Yeh its CI M 6.033	i didn't know that tbh i can't imagine what sort of writing u do in that class tho
Oh theres presentation and you read literature of computer systems I kinda watch the 1/10 of the first video segment 🤣🤣 and theres like a group project	ah rip i see
where you work on a system design	wait i didn't mean rip about the curriculum but the writing 
Bro jeffrey sent me that	HHAH that's my special link tho i'll send to jeffrey
Hahaha Where did yall hear this from :o	i've just been seeing some people posting on fb w it did u check yet
Ohh I see Im not home yet so Ill do it when Im home Is it cool?	yes it's cool
75%	aye nb
yeh nb its pretty cool 	yeah your match appears on my profile now too
oh rlly thats cool	yeppp
whats the vision for social spotify	it's like to allow people to discover and share music faster a centralized platform characterize yourself through music
oh sick okay excited for it	yee
aight imma hit up some games cya later broski	oh good luck haha Yo What note taking app do u use on ipad
Notability the g	Haha did u try out good notes too Why is Notability better Tryna decide where to invest my money lol
Uhm  this may be a good objective I have no problem with notability Bro did you splash yourself with a laptop ipad*	My dad found an iPad on sale one day Can u do PDF markup with notability And are they available online Like your notes
Wdym available onlinr yeh u can do pdf markup just downlosd the pdf and send it to ur notability	Like can u access your notes from on online cloud storage location So if I lose my iPad will it disappear w all my notes
ohh you can sync it with the cloud so u wont lose it i have a habit of not syncing my stuff	Oh like icloud storage?
so i almost lost my notes yeh	LOL Ok
sickk which ipad r u getting	I might go for that then I already have it it's just the 10 Oh wait 10 inch one I forget the actual name
what yr :o	I don't understand apples naming convention No idk Lol
oh lol	It looks great so far tho But then again
u werent constantly wowed by ipad note-taking so i wondered when u were gnna get one	I haven't used an apple decide in over 7 years
its okay	Lol yeah I was really impressed with the pencil
u can become like me where i have every apple devices except the phone	What phone do u have again I really like the Samsung tho
samsung s10	Ah yes Beautiful
Yes beautiful	It's aight I think at this point I'm used to devices that work suboptimally
🤣	Like this moto hasn't hindered anything in my life
i can relate	Even though it's a little laggy And crashes stuff sometimes
u get used to it	I'm always like This is expected And normal LOL But once u start getting good stuff u can't go back I think the iPad is gonna spoil me
It will dont fall in love with it	Lollll I need to learn smth or take a closs Class I want to try out the note taking experience haha
is ur urop not keeping u busy Oh u just want to use notability lmao	Yeslol Its not that busy The lab is kind of messy so Nobody knows what's going on half the time How's the internship tho
I haven't started Ive been doing stocks though thats a lot of fun	Lol what does that mean Like robinhood Investing?
yeh trading daily	R u making money?
trading pennystocks yeh	Lolll Nice
My momey experience from maplestory to csgo to this it has prepared me	LOL I was just gonna day
Have u played maplestory	Are u just waiting until stocks rise above price u bought it for Or is there some algorithmic calculating market price Going on No I never played
"Oh maplestory is just building ur character, killing monsters and gaining lvl, u sell items for me, all i did was stayed in the ""free market"" where u sell stuff to other players that experience taught me that i liked to bargain and profit 🤣🤣 uhm Im betting on stocks that I believe could go up due to news like I invested in this stock DGLY It makes police body cam"	Wowowowow
I invested about 2k at $3.6 avg per share	Oh very interestinf You're doing your research then
its up at 6.1 uhm kinda i use reddit to do the dirty work for me/tell me what are the popping stocks and i just research again to see if the stock is worth investing	Aye that sounds fun I'm scared to lose money lol I should do some research before I get into it
Tbh you should put 100 and play with it if ur not scared of losing that 100	That's fair lol
cs go gambling kinda made me risk tolerance	Wait there's gambling in csgo?
im comfortable being ballsy	I thought that was A shooting game
yeh there was esport betting	That's good lol Oh what interesing
where we bet on team matches that was my 2 years of hs 	Damn that's cool
its cool but i ended losing all the money and my friends	Rip that's OK good experience
yeh but Im investing in my roth ira im basically trading with my roth ira	Uhhhh What is that again
a retirement plan u should open one	Lol you're thinking about retirement already? Nbnb
wait u shud get in early cause ur investment grows tax free and theres a contribution limit 6k per year and income bracket limit ur income cant be more than 120k	OK I'm confused now But I'll look into it Wow I really don't know anything about money f
its okay you learn took me a while to shape my thoughts around stocks and roth ira like i previously thought u just put money into the roth ira but i found out u can develop ur own investment portfolio	:o damn you're really getting into it OK I gtg rn But Teach me more later
Yeah sure Take care bro	Haha u too :))
	thomas where can i get decently good matcha for not a high price i don't want culinary grade matcha or anything i just want it a lot lol
is 30 a lot?	idk that looks beautiful
Hahha Thats the one I buy its pretty good and cheap for its price 100g of matcha	Aye OK i might try that then Matcha is such an expensive taste to have lok
LOL I havent bought matcha since I got back home I can teach/give u recipe to the drink I made iced though	Oh yus
its relatively easy	I've been experimenting
Oh you have matcha?	Yee Lol the homies gifted me some
Oh shit You really like matcha :o since when	Haha well I've always liked it but Now that I have it I can drink it more So it's feeding my addiction
Oml Relatable	Lol
Uh so what type of matcha drink do u want	Idk tbh whatcha got
uhm i only know iced and hot for matcha only but what have u been makimg	that's aight hmu i've been making iced matcha lattes except it's just cold milk and most of the time there's not ice i thought an espresso matcha would taste really good so i tried to make that the other day but i only have a coffee machine so really it was a coffee matcha latte
wow how was that? nice hombre too	It actually tasted p good
did u add sugar :o	No I didn't lol I'm really into bitter stuff these days
LOl 🤣🤣🤣	like
I see ur cutting down that sugar	i've been trying to simulate iced americano too but it's just like iced coffee cuz i don't have espresso again sad
Awh Its okay u shud fund urself one	ikr
i love mine a lot life changer I think I broke even tbh Made a lot of drinks with that machine given a drink would be 5 bucks at a store	gotta get the bang for ur buck that's my worry what if my obsession with bitter things is a fad it could be permanent but i'm not sure
it changes youre just having a more expensive taste jj jk have u tried matcha with water and half and half	LOL i've never even had half and half what exactly is it
half whole milk and half heavy cream its really good!	oh what that's wild i've never had heavy cream but i can only imagine how would u make it with water and half and half
so u whisk up the hot matcha with warm water until its bubbly and u incorporate the matcha as well as u can pour the warm mixture over ice if u cup is like 16 oz pour like 1/2 up then you pour 8 oz of water thats basically the tea part then add like syrup to ur likening i usually do 1-2 tablespoon of simple syrup agave syrup works then add i forgot thr measurement for the half and half 1/3 cup i thonk	:oo ok i'll try that if i ever get half and half
Hey! Do you think you could look at my code for the 6.009 lab today at 4? I can't figure out what's wrong with the kernel function	Yeah do u want to come over to maseeh after 042 Im working on my rhetoric speech but I'll help u
Yea tysm!! 4:00 is good? That’s when I get out of class and I have smth at 5	Aren't we in 042 together? Yeah that works
Alright tysm! And nah I’m not taking 042	Oh huh okay I was confused cuz he lecture hall is the same as 009
Ohh haha gotcha Hey I’ll be there in 10 You missed a call from Trinity. Lmk when ur back! I’m in the lobby lol	Wait fuck did u see me Literally just went upstairs
Nope haha I’m just sitting here Ahh fuck	Oh Jesus okay I'm coming Lmao nbd
Wait what floor r u on	I can't believe I missed i 6
Shit that’s my bad Sorryyy	No it's alright lmao
Fuck haha I have another question For sharpened I made each value in the kernel 2/n/n And then I subtracted one from the middle value in the kernel (where it lines up with the pixel itself) And my values are only off by like a little	You should make every value -1/n^2 And then add 2 to the center pixel According to the sharpen formula on 6.009 The 2I stands for identity And b is for blur
Ohh fuck I got the two mixed up Okay thank you!!! An actual lifesaver 	Lol np
This is what I have right now I used just one kernel earlier but now I’m trying to subtract it manually without rounding or clipping in the correlated method Okay literally I bet this is a stupid mistake my blurred and edges work	where are you adding 2 for the identity
Oh I temporarily took it out Give me a moment Omg I got it Tysm	Lol What did u do
Idek lol It just worked Do you wanna work on 6.008 rn? *6.009	Sure I'm at step 5 and I'm in maseeh rn
Shit i have smth at 5 can I come at like 5:30? Can I come now?	Ye
Yayy which room again? I’m on the guest list now!	Aw shit yeah 6052
"Aight what did you get for the bacon path test? cuz i got ['Kevin Bacon',
 'Daniel Stern',
 'Leland Orser',
 'Elvis Presley',
 'Bill Haley',
 'Brenden Gallagher'] and idk why it's wrong"	wait aren't u missing the end person we also might have different qs Kevin Bacon to Julie Gayet is mine
i have to brenden gallagher oohhh	have u considered that when you go through the id list you may be rearranging the numbers
okay i like fixed mine so there's only one recursion where i find the bacon number and store the bacon levels at the same time	that's what happened to me
but it's still soo slow	oh huh that's weird
oh hmm what do you mean?	like from id_list to a name_list
oohhh	you have to ensure the order stays the same when u create a new name_list idk if u have a function for that though
so you're saying my numbers might be in the right order but the names aren't? cuz the tests have been passing up to test 13 at least haha 14 is still running	yeah oh man yeah i would recommend you try to make it more efficient now because i'm running my final private test cases before submission and there's these two anal cases that are based off of huge ass bacon numbers that need to stop early
ugh yea like i can work on that after but i just can't figure out why it's wrong it finally finished running the rest of the test cases and they all pass i guess i'll just go to lab tomorrow :(((( wait lol my get arbitrary path literally worked	wait so it worked?
no like my arbitrary path literally works and my bacon path doesn't but JUST for the one test on the website the tests in the test.py works	r u on the final step too because i think i know what you're talking about like final submission?
I finished all the methods And they pass the tests But for the one online submission for like getting the bacon path of an actor it’s not getting it right And it’s still slow	so all your bacon paths on your test cases pass? there is an online one that will take a long time because the bacon number is large
Yea	u need to find a way to stop early if you know a bacon number of n-1 is set()
Wait what do you mean?	so if you get a large bacon number and u need to find actors with that number if it's very large it will recurse very very deep so u need to find a way to stop when u realize that a number that large will be set()
What do you mean by when it will be “set()”?	empty set
Oh like when there are no more numbers of that bacon level or higher? Okay like speed is one thing I need to work on but I also don’t know why that one case they need online is not right Cuz it literally passes every single other test albeit slowly	Whats the output from the test
"['Kevin Bacon',
 'Daniel Stern',
 'Leland Orser',
 'Elvis Presley',
 'Bill Haley',
 'Brenden Gallagher'] Do you think you could run it on yours? For Brenden Gallagher"	U mean like run the bacon path from Kevin to Gallagher? Yeah but there are multiple solutions so idk if that would help Also I'm in recitation RN but after 3pm I'm good
Yea It’s okay I just wanna see what the bacon number should be Cuz I’m pretty sure it’s valid so the only other thing I can think of is that the length is wrong	Hmm OK and it's not passing the bacon path test? That's weird
Yeaa Or like it’s not in test.py It’s one of the online submissions	Is it asking for submission as a list or a set
It’s asking for list of actor names	Wait so is there any show/hide output Button
No there’s just a submit button	Oh right yeah you're not running code mb OK well I'll think
Ahhh okay ty!!! I’ll go to lab also and ask a TA	Oh yeah that's great ['Kevin Bacon', 'Curtis Hanson', 'Dean Jagger', 'Elvis Presley', 'Bill Haley', 'Brenden Gallagher']
Hey! How are you doing the word filter part? I feel like it's pretty simple but my brain just is not working hahaha	Hey I'm testing the last case rn We'll see if it works But yeah u can come over today if u want and I can take a look Honestly anjalie is better for these things she may be here too tho
Ohh okay thanks! Okay I’m not free until like 8:30 ish is that okay?	I'm probably going to be at wbl from 8 to 9 but yeah

i throught u didn’t want to drive	yeah i don't really but it seems like a hassle to make brian pick us all up
not really that’s already what i told him	ohhh that he's driving all four of us?
yeah that’s what i thought...? 	lmao i'm so confused okay so i'm picking up dongha and we're meeting at your house and then brian is going to your house to pick all three of us up?
yes...?????? ????? lol you’re so cute like a kitten	omg okay i'll text dongha now jk dongha blocked me
wait what 	IDK HE DOEES THIS ALL THE TIME
why?	he was being annoying yesterday and i called him out for it and then i didn't even realize he blocked me we do it to each other quite often tho but it's annoying

i mean go ahead	"he keeps telling me ""bye jamie"" ""farewell"""
i’m sure u could take him	and i'm like bitch stfu i have a whole summer and then HE has the AUDACITY to get annoyed at ME like WTF
it’s bc he’s gonna miss you so much!!! that he just doesn’t know how to handle it	bro he's actually such a baby hes like we're not going to be friends anymore because physical distance creates emotional distance and im lie what the FUCK and then he gets mad
do y’all want to be jongha or damie	omfg this is not oka
physical distance equals emotional distance???? quick someone get that on a fortune cookie or a throw pillow i think jongha is funnier should i text him then	yeah please Wait so am I asking andrew
sure	R they just there to hang or
yeah pretty much are you sleeping over	Probably can Wait so what's the time range I should give andrew

The strings on my racket are just too heavy	idk i think you're pretty good

Chez Ok gn	why are you telling me about your math teacher
Cuz she sucks	i hope to inspire you yeah she probably does
She is the worst Everyone hates her	oh whale
Even will And he doesn't hate anyone	well u already told me about will
She was literally like	it's cuz she's a bad teacher so no can do
"""what you get on quiz"""	good experience for teh future
And he said his score	when all teachers are bad wait she said that to will?
And she was mean and told him to look at notes Instead of hmwk Even tho we can look at the notes in the book	? hmm what does that even mean
She literally doesn't even need to be there And we would be fine	lol go off victor lol
She told him to read the notes she was doing	oh
Even tho it was anything	that seems rude
And all the notes we need are I. The book	lol okay i get it that's okay victor
What a loser	hey now maybe she's just not that experienced it's okay if she's not good at teaching
Noooo Noo She's not new She is old Teach	as long as she's not mean or rude it's okay
And I don't know how she still has her job She issss tho	hmm okay
Will was doin a hmwk	i'm sorry for your loss then but at least u can learn how to handle bad teachers ig
And the teacher told him to look at notes we didn't meed Need	she probably just wants him to pay attention in class
She is useless We don't need to pay attention because she doesn't teach anything And if she does I just read from the book because it's what we need Not her stupid notes That is just copied from the book She doesn't even try to teach properly	yeah but it reflects badly on her if she doesn't make the students pay attnetion right yeah u should just learn how u learn best but always be respectful even if she's not a good teacher because that's called being a good person
I guess but she should do things other than just put the book on the board Alright I wanna go do a sleep Gn	okay good night The video chat ended. hi!

"oH that makes sense if you wanna have a look, I recommend ""the gentleman's guide"" by filthy frank on youtube it's mostly edgy and non-pc slapstick humor  "	Lol alright Thanks
I don’t recommend going too deep on Frank’s channel	Weird stuff?
Kinda? Idt it suits your tastes is all ie vomit cake Yea weird is one way to put it. Another is fucked up, disgusting, etc	Lmao OK I see what u mean
Comedy fucking GOLD in my opinion But yea a little too far out there	Its a niche humo
Oo surprisingly mild evaluation	I haven't looked at t yet
Ok that makes sense I remember laughing my ass off at this stuff freshman year and did the same when I rewatched these all 2 weeks ago	Lol still the same
Exactly. Like 0 improvement At least in my sense of humor ig	LOL I mean Does it matter
Yes I don’t wanna just always laugh at the same stuff It gets boring even if it’s funny	Lol OK I see I an going to sleep now And I will take a look at the thing tmrw
Same Yo what was that one AP Lit book again I feel like we were in the same discussion group for it too Something to do with a painting And a dude staying young forever because of it And an old gay dude	LMAO the picture of dorian gray i don't remember the old gay dude hto
the dude who painted the picture lol thanks. I was convinced the word painting was in the title	He just though Dorian was his muse it doesn't explicitly say he's gay but like I think since the author was gay He was also implied to be gay
Yes that’s the man I imagine him a bit pudgy for some reason too The way he described dorian as his muse was always very fruity Or like extravagant	Lol What
did he not say that Dorian was the light illuminating his darkness at some point or was I reading a dorian gray fanfic	Oh uhhhh Perhaps It's been a while
Have u read anything since then?	not that much but yeah wait bro dorian gray was the first book we read in lit you mjust have read something afterwards
uh metamorphosis metamorphasis	That's it ? ? ?
"I mean I haven't read anything in college maybe parts of the Bible if u wanna count that idk if I told u but I am trying to start with ""The Color of Magic"" by terry pratchet hopefully it's good this count?"	Lol Sure
Wait what did we read after Dorian gray then I know we did reading groops twice	i can't remember reading a full book after that lol there was like wuthering heights i completely skipped reading i was supposed to read slaughterhouse too what r u doing this summer lol u seem to have a lot of time to ponder these things rn
Oh yea slaughterhouse was what I ‘read’ for lit summer hw Random stuff tbh I wanna expand my horizons or whatever So I started sketching, reading, and doing programmingg puzzles Also cooking Which is actually pretty fun Wbu?	Oh cool that's called personal development nice Wish I had that sort of motivation Um I'm still in school lol I have two finals this Friday and another two next week
Oh damn. R u studying for finals then? That makes sense tho. U guys had ur externships so u started around 2 weeks after we did, right? LOL that’s one way to look at it Another way is just that I couldn’t find myself a job or internship lmao What about summer plans? Classes maybe?	yeah lol we started first week of feb yeah i'm doing remote urop over the summer + hopefully personal development
Good luck dude. Two on the same day is a crunch What that’s really cool Is it CS related? Start playing tennis again! I’ve been running lol Well not running. I biked a bit today. Not in shape enough to run	Yep The tennis courts are all closed haha Plus my parents would never let me leave the house where there could be other people I'm super out of shape
You could definitely hop that fence true. It's interesting seeing how much more seriously asian people are taking this stuff compared to others well not necessarily asian people my parents ig gotta start somewhere! something to do with image processing? that seems to be the buzz cuz of self driving	i mean rather safe than sorry my past work is computer vision this summer it'll be nlp so that's exciting
Yea exactly. I agree with the asian view of things Which makes me question myself but also Like wtf are people doing hosting parties and stuff Bringing it back to AP lang, to what extent should we quarantine? I think asians might be overdoing it, but I also don’t know how Natural Learning Programming...? Idk what nlp is sir Are u working on a specific thing? The research papers I’ve seen videos about usually have a lot to do with simulating or image alterations	Ew I hate to what extent questions Natural language processing Not sure uet It'll have to do with news bias tho
Oops I forgot to respond I’m all good now!	Lol That's good
Jam!!!!	Yeah!!! What's up
Nothing Just wanted to talk	Lol So How's it going
I am scared Loud noises and Zoi don’t go well together	It's a thunderstorm
Yeah Loud noises No bueno	Stay warm Lol It's not going hurt u
I’m hiding under my covers atm	good idea
Still scared bc it’s dark now!!!	Dw It's not too bad Plus your family is going to commencement w u right
Blah	Same
Alr When you free	i'm free most mornings but i can't spend any more money i'm going broke my entire tuesday next week is free
I usually don’t spend money anyways We can go on a hike!!! Are you free tomorrow morning? I’ll go to the gym and then we can go hike!!!	Oh wait that will take a long time I have to be home Before 12 or 1130
Oh shoot you meant morning morning But I have to go to the gym :/	It's ok Just lmk
What can we do for like an hour...	I don't usually wake up before 10 anyways I'll see u at a couple grad parties too I'm assuming
Tomorrow???	Not tmrw
Nope wasn’t invited to any tomorrow No we have to hang out	This weekend or smth
I will wake up at 8 to go to the gym	I'm only staying at each for an hour anyways No don't worry seriously
And then I will be sweaty and gross and we can meet at 10 ducking am	LMAO it doesn't have to be tmrw
:/ I’m sad	Don't be
Bc I feel like this is the start of us never hanging out	We'll work something out How can something not happening be the start of smth
That’s exactly how the not happening thing begins! With something never happening	but it something never happened didn't it start before the never was applicable
. No listen to the logic	… I'm listening
When something doesn’t start It is the start of it never starting	That defeats the definition of the word start then
Shhhhh called you. Do you want to go to Anjali’s grad party with me	Yeah I'll probably be going What time r u thinking
Whenever	730 work w u? I gotta get Indian formal from saranya She wants me to wear

Just know I(this is bolded i just cant do it on messenger) think you're so super amazing	ok zoe no what college you go to does not determine how special you are that is measured by the people around you and to people who care about you, you are special also yeah getting rejected sucks lmao imposter syndrome :ppp thanks i think you're super amazing too make sure you keep the fire burning!! as in the metaphorical fire powering your goals and shit

They’re cuddling! Ew!	Yeah lol They are
Ew! I also hate men	Who And what did he do to u
every man jamie they just make me sad thinking about them I have decided that when we both are old and unmarried, we're gonna be roommates I'm gonna have a house in miami so. Miami.	i'm down to be roommates alas men disappoint left and right but not in miami i don't like florida weeather
yes, the only thing men do is dissapoint what I want to live in miami for the first portion of my life I have a plan we can move wherever you want when we're both rich	why first portion
so I guess we have to both achieve the richness first LOL	what's the plan
The plan: Get a really good job and make them move me to Miami slyly so they have to pay for my apartment, then save until I buy a yacht and then get into real estate in a way that I buy a bunch of properties and like rent them and manage them while still working at my job then I save up a little more from that and then go into the stock market while still making money from both my job and my real estate	how slyly what does a yacht have to do with real estate getting into real estate requires capital man and if you're making that much money from your job in the first place might as well just stick with it
hehe yeah, that's why I gotta work first!	real estate and the stock market are volatile
I like the management of real estate	ok u should
stocks are more	just get a real estate job
dangerous for me	off the get go dangerous for all
i mean at the moment I think I want to do consulting still there is a BCG office in Miami which is the dreaM!	oh huh interesting
yeah, life plan LOL but plans change and I hope everything works out for me! sent an attachment.	is this dangerous is this a phishing attempt
no jamie watch the video you dumbass	oh ok
it's f u n n y	give me a second LOL ok
my roommate is laughing at your response	lol well it was suspicious
"LMAO
did you watch our v i d e o we want to fame"	yes i watched it i'm not surprised that u did the second half
me neither lol we have our hotel and flights booked super excited to see you soon	oh shitttt that's exciting
im super excited	i'm more excited
jam i don't think my interview went very well and I'm a little bummed	Sorry I just woke up
No you’re fine Thanks jam I miss you	Miss u too bb Seriously tho
I need your reassurance sometimes lol I know	Things happen sometimes And nobody ever lives a perfect lode Life Literally I bawled about this a couple days ago I was like
Why!	Why don't I have a summer internship and everybody else does? Why don't I have a life
Omg ham	Why am I not an interesting person
You’re tripping	And the answer is
You’re the most interesting person I know	Lol Not true
All these stupids are just in your way	But Thanks anyways
Heheh I literally think you’re the greatest If I was recruiting You’d get the job on the spot	Lmao thanks zoe I'll beok tho This conversation rn isn't about me Its about u
Noooo	R u doing well otherwise

No you don’t! You never even talk about the baseline Boys!	What's th
But I’m okay, I had my whole crying freak out during first round interviews so I think I just got it out of the way	Wait what
So now I’m just kinda like I did my best and that’s all I can do	I think something that helps is if u just kind of Treat it like Not a big deal Like Sometimes you just gotta be like This is not going to ruin my life If I don't get in And college is a time to fail so
That is very true	Fail a lot when u can
I’m like sad obviously But I’m not gutted or crying or like uber uber disappointed	Haha OK then that's good
Yeah, I just am kinda going with it now But jam It’ll be fine You’ll get like 500 internships And you’ll be like Damn Who these bitches who got these low tier internships	Lmao
Like I’m working at google Or Facebook I am mark	It's a bit late 8n the game for that
Zuckerberg	But I appreciate the enthusiasm It's ok I'm over it I'll find something to do Or I'll just go home I like being at home too
You know I would love that, but you would not love that, jam, you’ve done something like every summer You still have time right? I think when it really matters, you’ll pull clutch	Lmao I wouldn't love it but I also have realized I don't like working either And internships are always just meh work anyways
I suppose You and I could start a business	No I'm honestly like
I have an idea But idk how to make an app	Oh
Or like the logistics	That's Java right
But I think the idea is good!	What business r u thinking
Not sure ham! So You know how subscription based services are really hot right	Yes
And you know how recently I’ve been really into fitness and getting muscular and all that stuff	Yes
Something I’ve realized is that the guides that I want are like 40 a piece, and that’s just for like a 6-8 week program Especially from influencers that have multiple guides, that’s like a lot of money My idea is an app that compiles like these fitness and diet guides all together(not necessarily every guide from every person, but a nice amount) and have users pay a monthly subscription to have access to all the guides and diet stuff That way they can try a bunch of different scientific methods of exercising to see which one works best for them And then Because not all the guides from one person are on this app When they find the one that fits them best, they can cancel their subscription and just purchase like the rest of that person’s stuff Because exercising works differently for different body types And different food and diets work for different body types And it’ll have like recipe books, and macro stuff, and scientific data, but it’ll also have like beginner things for people that have no clue what they’re doing And hopefully, people will be more inclined to allow the app to have their first guide because they’re like proud of the results, and because they know the users will see results and end up buying more of their guides Good question! I sorta answered that with the little paragraph above, but yeah, most of those influencers have 3+ fitness guides and I would only want like 1 Once again! Very true! Guides at least in my experience are like 6-8 weeks each, so if they really wanted to find a healthy variety, they could def stay with it forever and keep changing it up. But yeah, if they found someone or something they really liked, they def would leave the service No I think they would get a percentage of the subscription I mean again this is just an idea, but I was thinking that once it’s more established, there would be a flat rate to like “buy to use” or rent their guides Instead of a percentage	This sounds very intriguing I don't know enough about the influencer industry or workout industry lol to know if it makes sense But in my mind this could be good It's primary hurdle would be getting initial users
Just an idea! That I thought of in sustainability class LOL, I just got really into fitness these past couple months	We love a healthy young fit woman
Yeah, if I truly wanted to pursue this, I would have to think of a LOT more logistics But I would use the service! 	aw it's okay zoe it's a good tiktok though
LOL relatable content	saranya told me what happened today how are you
You mean when I cried for like 2 hours in my dark room I’m better now It just sucks Partly because I was so close??? Like I got on the waitlist but wasn’t good enough to get into the club	is this better or worse than getting flat out rejected crying can be good for you but don't let these things sit too heavy in your heart life is full of chances
I dunno I’m getting rejected tomorrow woot But yeah I’ll be sad for like 2 weeks And get over it	what's coming out tmrw i would say 2 weeks is a bit of a long time i started this kdrama yesterday and it's literally been so sad to watch
Bc I got waitlisted So the rejection is tomorrow 	but it's about this lady that got old
I am emotional All the time What the	but overnight
That’s normal life Oh LOL	because she timetraveled to save her dad and then the next day she was like 75 the point is not the time traveling the point is to cherish your youth and not waste 2 weeks being sad over this because honestly
Cherish your youth Yes That’s true	is your unhappiness worth it?
Okay I get the point	no it's not
Yes	it's your life so do whatever the fuck u want
LOL yeah idk	and give it your all but don't be sad for too long
I’m just inherently sad	the only value in sadness is the contrast it provides happiness you know things in life are like this just because you try really really hard does not mean you will automatically have success instead trying really really hard works like this you put your effort in like 10 things maybe 20 and you succeed in 1 of them but were the other 19 a waste? absolutely not no sir they were not
That’s interesting that you say that Bc I can’t Try so many things I literally pick one or two that I put like 200% effort into I rewrote my nexecon essays 6 times It took me like 5 hours for 3 150 word essays	i don't mean at a time that'd be foolish i mean over time
But everything is at the same time The first 2 weeks	that's good that means you actually worked hard
But it didn’t pay off And I was sad	well that is the nature of these things they don't always pay off like i said over time not everything has to be now and think about it this way is club recruiting your whole life? no false think of all the things you appreciate in your life that you enjoyed would a nexecon interview be one of them? no wrong so what i'm trying to get at here is that cherish your youth yanno and be sad yeah but only be sad the amount u think it's worth and if you think it's worth 2 weeks of sadness reevaluate you can do it i believe in you
I get it It’s hard in the moment But day by day it’ll get better! I know it will!	yes u bet it will let's get this bread
lets do it but i will need 2-3 business days to cope with this tragedy	lol okay i have faith in you and i'll check in
thanks jam	Love u

JAMIEEEE	ZOEEEEEEEE
I just missed you	Aw I missed u too What's s up
not a lot just finishing up some finals amy izzy and I are doing this like travel project if corona permits which i think is going to be awesome I'm also writing a lot I called my MOR today and he gave me a lot of good feedback and results	who is mor dude you're in the home stretch that's really good so youre gonna try to go somewhere?
the love of my life, my master of rituals for the business frat. He's a writing tutor, going into consulting at Bain	LOL cool what the heck is master of rituals
Ok the premise of the project is basically that we've lived in michigan for so long and we have yet to truly explore our own state. We're creating a type of brand that's a website/blog and social media presence that provides michiganders and travelers with itineraries of the best road trips and sites in michigan. I think the best way that I describe it is like work hard play hard, because we get the opportunity to travel almost every weekend, but we are also going to seriously take photos, we're doing a fuck ton of research before, izzy needs to code large interactive portions of our website, I need to write the blog posts, Amy needs to film and edit videos and photos so we provide the best content for our brand I think it'll be super fun and give me a good sense of a large scale project like this. I also love writing, taking photos, and traveling so it combines a shit ton of my interests and I'll learn a lot too from all the spreadsheets, research, and all that we have to conduct for this to be successful	haha wow ambition i love it
I also am running marketing, so i'm gonna practice a lot with cold emails, advertising, ect	that's exciting
I think it'll be a great project for the summer! if corona lets up that is but even then, michigan is nature	i mean we still have a travel ban until may 15 if u don't mind tha stay at home*
yeah, the plan is to start beginning of june hopefully but who knows	yay that'll be fun
yeah! I'm just making sure that I keep myself busy	haha yeah i'm not doing a very good job of that
If corona is over you should hop on one of our weekend trips! You’ll have a lot of fun I think	Haha I thought it was a summer long thing Didn't know u guys would come back in between
Nah, it’s sort of like a mini trip every weekend And I’m talking every weekend jams	Oh woww
it's a really interesting opportunity hehehehehehe I do be hyped for it	yeah that's really exciting
what're you doing this summer bb!	um i'm going to be uroping with a prof at mit
when are you planning on heading back to Boston? when corona clears up?	i'm doing a remote urop for the summe
oh ok is it a full time gig? will you have time for ME	haha yes honey hopefully my advisor isn't a slave driver he's a little famous actually so it's really weird not famous but his name pops up when you look him up he's by no means one of the most famous professors at mit
HAHA that's so cute	it's basically full time yeah he's really strange tho i guess all geniuses are
nuts, hopefully you can hop on one trip around the mitten with your best home town friends	but he's been learning chinese so the last 3 calls i've had with him he keeps trying to sprinkle chinese in i have to get through finals tho rip

It's not the most refined thing, but the stories are decent	Wait what's this Wow you are super productive Side projects and inspiration are the most anyone could ask for It's on Spotify wowowow
it's just the website that I chose haha I have three projects that I want to complete, used to be two, but tacked on the podcast idea I want to write and illustrate a children's book Do my travel blog with iz fizz and amwang and then talk to people about their stories and get it on this podcast!

no. confidence C O N F I D E N C E SCREAM	AH
love the enthusiasm	AHHHH  hi i haven't talked to u in a while just checking in how are u doing
Meh I’m doing okay How’re you	wow u and amy responded almost at the same time meh what r u up to i'm doing alright
Damn I’m horrible at responding now I’m sorry	Lol All good
Now I feel like a dick Bc I came on To send you smth And I never responded to you LOL	Lol Yes U did that to me What were u gonna talk about to me tho
so, zoe wrote something and was wondering if jamie would be interested in writing something too  it's specifically for Asian Americans and one single argument that I've seen being used. Was wondering if you wanted to pick a singular issue and respond to it	I'll take a look Wait what am I supposed to respond to
I figure your parents are pretty progressive	Yeah
but there are a lot of parents and grandparents out there on weChat that def are not like examples are Isabelle's parents and some others I don't know if you've seen a lot of the things posted on weChat, but I'm trying to get a response to almost all the reasons why Asian Boomers and parents are refusing to support BLM, or pushing against it	Oh yeah I don't really know about them tbh The only one I've seen is the dear Yale student one
here I copy pasted something I sent to someone earlier I’m sure you know that racism in the Asian community, esp against black people is really prevalent and common. I wrote an open letter that target’s one issue I’ve been seeing and hearing about on weChat, and I’m just reaching out to other asian Americans to see if they want to write a letter about a separate issue to refute why Asians aren’t supporting BLM	Are u going to publish this to wechat groups to get it to circulate among Asian parents That's a side question But
I'm gonna try to put something together and get it translated specifically for my friend's parents	Hmm OK if your ultimate goal is to educate them and change their opinion This is unasked for feedback I know
All i've wanted to do was really educate myself and other people who haven't educated themselves yet	Yeah that's good
give me the tea what is the feedback	"OK so first I should answer your question I would definitely want to contribute to this but ATM I don't have enough context or any of my own personal experiences to write something I think will be particularly convincing But My feedback revolves around how Asian parents read things In my personal opinion the wording of your piece comes off too strongly and doesn't warm up to the point Human beings are kind of like this If your main goal is the get someone to change their viewpoint immediately and u come right off the bat by saying ""you should do this or you should do that"" Your audience is more likely to dig in their heels deeper Into their own beliefs"
interesting feedback, okay, I get where you're coming from where else should I make my edits	I think you should be wary when trying to approach Asian parents on this note because even tho your piece right now speaks more truthfully and emotionally than a slow warm up piece It kind of has to be modified to be lighter and more gentle like teaching a child They have to think you're on their side Like don't be afraid to be manipulative in a sense
interesting, okay. So if I get rid of the first sentence, I get that it'll be less abrasive, and I am pulling them in with the outrage over asian american attacks but how do I make the rest of it less punchy and more cradle-y	Yeah so I think something interesting about psychology is like Making your intentions subverted Like human beings love choices If they make a choice that makes them fee) like a better person They dig that shit So make it more like Oh here's the facts and statements, acknowledge their fears and rebuttals, And then kind of but not really give them a choice
interesting okay	Yeah idk it's like when u teach a child you're like Oh I wanna help u win And like sometimes People just gotta be convinced to do the thing for the wrong reasons before understanding the right reasons And like I know most people hate that And they post all the time on social media about like hey if you think this get out and it's very much non educative Idk is this too manipulative It's up to u Personally if I were to try and convince somebody This is what I would do lol
I also was thinking partially that the translations in chinese should lean more to that I'm gonna use another doc and rework it a little and see if I like it but I appreciate the feedback and advice lol, no need to tiptoe around it, I know you always mean well	"haha lol thanks i do it like this cuz my body rejects crticism kind of naturally so i imagine that other people might also feel the same way cuz my mind knows that i'm like not always right yeah also if you haven't seen the dear yale student letter the idea of that is that basically asians should be grateful for the opportunities this country has offered us and all the work their parents have put in a perspective is that putting yourself in protests or positions of ""resistance"" puts that in danger"
The dear yale student is a letter in response to Eileen's original letter isn't it?	Possibly I haven't seen the original letter
I think you should read the original letter	Who was that letter directed to The originap Yeah I'll read it
I'll see if I can find it for you	It's fine I found it
did you find the one website that allows comments too read what the asian parents commented too I think that's important also if you have alink to dear yale student, do you mind sending it to me my parents talked about it haven't read it yet though	I don't have it I saw it on somebody's story I can find it right now it's fine
thanks!	Hmm it's not online in a public place actually Are your parents siding with the letter U could ask them to read it It must. Be circulating on wechat groups
with eileen's letter? or the dear yale student letter	Latter
no they don't side with that letter	Oh then u could just ask to read it Anyways the discourse in the comments misses the point
i agree	This is why The audience is important Eileen's letter is well written but because it makes generalizations a lot of people will find that to be uncomfortable I think theres a fair amount of people in the comments that agree that they should find for the movement but Nitpick over her disappointment with the community as demonstrating ungratefulness and turning her back On her culture
I think the people pushing back so hard are just so sold that they're in the right, it won't really matter what is written and how well it's written right?	Actually I think They're just nitpicking
because the one's that claim that they're not racist and to not group them into that statement are also the ones that include the but.. and give justification to why they aren't adamantly supporting the movement but won't they nitpick anything? anything that is written will have a flaw to someone who is searching only for flaws	I haven't seen those sorts of comments Sure you're right All writing has flaws Obviously her generalization doesn't mean every single person But people of construing it as a personal attack and rejection of her culture So that's what I'm say8ng
that is true, it would be better accepted if it was worded differently and adjusted	I think that discourse is not important to address tho Because that's just nit
I think esp as like young people, we're used to using stronger language to portray more emphasis, but in these situations you actually can't do that	That's true
hey are you free today, for a hike or some type of social distanced activity	This is why I prefer clarify over emotion in my own writing Because it's easy to miss the point otberwsie
I get that	I'm pretty distanced ATM lol I can't really leave the sub And technically I'm working rn oops
But I also hopefully am a creative writing minor and I rely a lot on emotions and personal experiences to stress my points distanced as in you haven't seen anyone ever or like	Oh interesting this is the first time I'm hearing this
you hang out with the homies	Uh I don't seen anyone ever
oh damn, strict distancing, respect.	Lol My family is pretty strict about it yeahn
it's a good thing to be strict about it	Yeah my guess is that it'll be like this for a while tho Which is sad
do you know what MIT is doing next sem?	No They sent out a pulse survey yesterday It's not looking too good
do you know what you'll do if it's online? I'm assuming you aren't too keen about paying like for an online semester	If it's completely online I'll probably take a gap year
what will you do during your gap year?	Eh idk
might I recommend the pacific crest trail, or any type of backpacking solo adventure I could live vicariously through you	HAHA wow I'd totally be too scared to do that R u going back to school for sure then
unsure I really want to take a gap year but I'm not a risky person	Huh I never really thought of u that way I always thought u were the risk taker Andi was the more Boring one
Well On a spectrum of taking risks I think that I’m pretty low I do think you’re a little lower than me LOL	Damn called out Ok Fair I don't think you're that low tho lol
haha, i think my friends are like 2 ends of the spectrum like yesterday I followed olivia and izzy with this random group of people until we found a rope swing in the middle of brighton I didn't go on it bc I was SCARED	lol what
they're all insane idk	Wait a rope swing isn't too bad
It was like the jankiest rope swing I’ve ever seen in my whole life	lol was it hanging over a cliff
No, it was like a ladder on a tree	ohhh huh interesting

Oh dang I can't imagine living in the cold Wait what major are you?	wow wonder what it feels like to live in california computer science baby sellout all the way
Wow impressive What are you doing over the summer?	what r u studying uh no clue yet lmao sad
Most likely physics But I’m still deciding between physics and math	OHO SO COOL r u gonna be a researcher famous prof one day
Hey Do you know any upperclassmen 6-7 people	What's 7 But no
Biology	I don't know any upperclassmen actually
Oh	Lmao Sorry
I'm trying to sketch out my schedule	Oh wow
To see if I can do thid learning community	I haven't even thought about this yet
Nah the one I want to do requires all these classes But I wanna do some other stuff	Oh wow U can ask someone on fb perhaps?
I am I know a bunch of sophomores for some reason	Oh huh Math stuff?
Research stuff I went to jshs nationals and met a bunch of people who were starting at mit the next year	Oh nice
Did you meet people at simons that way too?	Everyone from simons is in the same grade But yeah
Can you come to my party on the 16th?	Yeah probably I'm not sure yet tho I should be able to stop by even if not for long
Cool My recital is 6-7 and my party is 7- whenever Hey, can you send me the form that you sent to MIT for requesting dual enrollment credit to be accepted	Wait it's really easy to find just go to the MIT math departments transfer credit page
but you filled it out right :P	Yeah But it's so easy to find
Hey do you have any info about what’s happening during the first 30 mins of the idea factory event by start labs	Nope We don't have details confirmed yet Still speccing it out honestly we're a mess
Okay So I’m trying to pick out a flight for coming back to Boston and idk if having a flight that lands in Boston at 10:34 is too problematic	In the morning? Dwai
Hmm Idk Like is this a team forming thing	Yeah there are supposed to be teams
you should start a mahjong club at MIT if there doesn't exist one yet	lmao there in fact does exist one why did u just start one i know how to play tho i'm just not in the club
Yeh 3 friends and I started mahjong club at Penn lol	ayeee wholesome u coming to boston anytime soon?

yeh feel abt the same	:pp All gopf Good Takes time
troo when's ur break	Three weeks The 20th ish
o that's kinda far	Agreee Too far
when was your winter break	Like Until the 6th Technically we have January off
HMMMMM	but that's fake news
how is it fake news we went back to school the 2nd week of jan lol	It's called independent activities period
so it's not actually a break?	I mean that's when our iap started Most people do something like an externship or teach abroad etc etc
o interesting	Yeah Honestly I didn't like it at forst But it's hella preferable to school I die Just like On a daily basis
00f sometimes I question why I came to Penn over Umich for engineering	Do u not like it there
and then I remember not wanting to go to school 20 mins from where I live lol	Oh lmao Yee
nah I like it here	You could always transfer here And that's even farther
*thonk*	From michigan What Does that mean
funny thing is I kinda wanted to go to MIT but my mom didn't want me to cuz she figured I'd die from stress	Did u apply Well sir
lol yeah I did	That was smart Of her
and also like transfer kinda fake cuz I have friends and clubs already friends sort of	Facts
clubs definitely	Transfer is no good What clubs r u in Actually I feel like transferring can work out But like
Penn Electric Racing, Penn Symphony Orchestra, Penn Lions, Penn Mahjong	At some point it does not matter
transferring can work out but also like I don't want to have to make new friends again bc transition period is fucking worst	Yeah I vibe w that
I'm high key just learning everything engineering from PER	What's that
bc they're like the entirety of Penn Engineering's advertising Electric Racing lol	Oh so cool
you in clubs?	Yeah you should come to hackmit next fall I'm on the organizing team The other clubs are basically irrelevant after that Ig club tennis And there's two other business orgs
lol I haven't touched my racquet since I've come here damn are you a business major also I'm not great at compsci lol I'm p ok but I don't think I'm good	no probably not lmao they're like b-tier at best i didn't get into the legit ones what are u majoring in
Prob double E	oh interesting i am actually grappling with this ee thing myself i might be eecs i'm tentatively still cs tho
Daayymm Lol I think EE is just broader	ee is too hard
Lol ig I'll see Havent even done an ee class yet Besides signal processing which is not hard So far at least	signal processing counts as ee what is that btw
like mathematical waves and their applications some of the stuff we've covered has been like digital audio, sound compression, and voice recognition so far	wati what that's so cool but i hate math
Hey sorry it’s running close on time, but wanted to ask how you feel ab sandbox over summer for the social Spotify idea I’m thinking it’ll be low commit but potentially could be really cool There’s no pressure, just wanted to make sure your cool with being on/off the application, or if u think we shouldn’t even do it without you because you are a co-owner of the idea	Oh sorry I've been glancing here and there at sandbox it sounds really cool I def think applying is cool Do we all need to apply Or is one app enough cux I have been a little hosed so I haven't been paying attention
"I'm reading the application and I think they're trying to get person count, but it seems the real application will be in a few days ""As it's an unusual summer, it is important for Sandbox to get a sense of how many students are interested in pursuing a summer pursuing their ideas with support from Sandbox.  The application process will be communicated to those interested in a few days."" Wouldnt risk not submitting it, but we can write up most of it"	Oh hmmm yeah I'm doing full time urop though this summer so idk if we would have enough manpower to do it this summer Would be interested in still pursuing it tho
I'm thinking low commit I have an internship	Oh okay yeah then I'm down
Okay cool I think David knows someone who might be interested in joining us And I know someone who might be good for guiding the music features But also bringing on so many people is alot Wanted to check in that stuff with ya, we can prob do in main chat	Ah I see Ok suree i'd still be down to do sandbox but if it's got a really formal process we don't have to go through with it sorry i just saw your message oh the deadline is tn right ah well it's fine we can still work on this over the summer on the off
yeah damn i submitted it like 2 mins ago We can prob add you But it needed just like you to make an acc	ok sure i'll take a look
Well i needed to add you from the interface lemme check if theres a add button /edit whats your email It looks like i can click add, not sure if i can resubmit tho worth a try bc its like 2 mins	jamiefu@mit.edu i just made an account
did you get an email from our team inviting you	yep i see it that was quick lol looks good
I have one! I can bring it sometime during bp this weekend so ppl can try *next weekend	oh awesome i'm so excited lol

lol mine is really weird rn but like for the opposite way almost? i keep absolutely crashing at like 11:30 and waking up at 8 naturally	What??????
i have no idea why that has just become my sleep schedule	that's actually so good and crazy i think i fucked mine up because i keep sleeping at ungodly hours did u see colleen's email
yeah just saw it i mean i think it’s fine?	ok should we respond
yeah sure	Sorry I didn't do this yet did u
oh no I can do it now	lol cool thanks aliza aliza i just did the fps just now it's really easy i can still join you tomorrow morning but it honestly might be worth to just do it together on thursday evenings bc it seems like nb unless we have a new teammates teammate*
oh cool that's good to know Thursday evenings would probably work in the future I just can't do next week but I also can't do fps next week like on Friday either so I guess that doesn't matter lol	Oh lmao that's all right Do u still want to do tmrw morning
hahaha i pick fruit snacks	ok thanks your assassins target is jack - check go/assassins for the rules, starts tonight at 12am text me/jack if you have any contested kills, but otherwise if you kill someone just have them pass on their target to you

hi jamie!! it just means generally working on CR related tasks like helping set up events even for companies that you’re not directly in charge of but I would definitely recommend applying!! it’s a super low commitment (1-2hr/week) way to get more involved in wbl and you can take as much initiative as you would like :)	Alright cool thanks amber I'll definitely consider applying then! Hopefully you'll see my app in the next week haha hey amber i just submitted my app! just wanted to make sure you got it :)
Yep! Got it :)	Awesome thanks! hey amber i've been seeing a lot of organizations making statements lately regarding BLM and was wondering if wbl has any capacity to do that as well / match any donations i'm not sure of our financial status + viewpoints from the rest of board so i wanted to reach out to you first

I have class until 4 I prob can’t make it anyways Unless........	Skip???? Someone ik in startlabs said that the Singapore lodging is basically one big resort
mayybee haha thats actually so cool what did i do to deserve this?!?!	LOL WHAT you're literally like one of the smartest people ik
an incredibly false statement you clearly haven't seen me struggling with the 6004 lab	LMFAO why is your one class with 2 zeros difficult compared to the others
6.004 is my hardest class by far Imma go to office hours When are you usually there	Aw yay I'm there Monday afternoons and Wednesday afternoons 2-4p Mon 1-3 wed APPLY TO HACKMIT
Can I have the link?	YES go.hackmit.org/apply Apply to more than one committee because dev is really full rn I recommend CR they're pretty lit Actually you're pretty smart so dev would like to have u
okie dokey ty v much:D this is for the fall semester right	Wait No like This spring But if u join now you'll contribute significantly to hack 2020 Fall recruits are usually manual labor for a bit
aight gotcha makes sense	Haha yeah but it'll be awesome if u join now
Smurf only has like 4 guys	lmao i just saw the email unfortunate why tho lmao do guys not like singapore i think singapore is cool also the requirements are so sad i just lost my lanyard with my ID in it yesterday what am i supposed to do about the ID card lmfao
I guess you won’t be able to go  It’s gonna be a ton of fun you’ll miss out on	T.T why are you doing this to me this is so depressing i tapped in last night to maseeh and didn't leave with it this morning so literally where could it be
It probably fell thru the elevator crack tbh I can’t think of any other reason You can request for a new one right	sir it was an entire ass lanyard how could that fail through the crack i'm also kind of doubting myself now as to whether i actually tapped in this is sa d
quite unfortunate whyy isnt ur id in your wallet??	:((( my lanyard basically was my wallet i had to deactivate my credit card today too ://
Oh  Really hope you end up finding everything	haha thanks archer me too but i doubt it i am slowly coming to terms with this tragedy lmao
Any luck today??	noooooo :((( i'll be ok tho i just don't have tap access anywhere lmao :pp
its ok you can still get into the stud late at night without tap access ;)	wait what why is this some reference i do not understand
If u go to the doors near the Dunkin’ Donuts side And pull hard enough Then you can get it If you don’t believe me I’ll show you	lmao ok down lol i'm actually not replacing my ID for another week i'm tryna see if it pops up by magic which is just like not gonna happen lmao david told me on tuesday that you fell asleep before coming to oath for hack and that you were stressed and ver busy so maybe you should be less busy and sleep more
yea tuesdays are the worst for me im basically running around from place to place from 9 to 5pm lol its a lot better rest of the days tho haha when's ur busiest day	tuesdays and thursdays lol i have 930 to 330 tomorrow but that's not as bad as you oh well ig i have evening lab from 730 to 10pm which sucks mon i'm done by 2pm but then i go LA for like 3 hours wed i'm done at 12pm but then i go LA for 2 hours firday i'm chillin after 12pm
Big brain schedule  Oh dang I didn’t know you had to LA for 3 hours Also 004 quiz seems hard LOL	You just have to for a certain number of hours a week Good luckkkk Also I FOUND MY LAMYARD
WOAH Where’d you find it?!?	some guy emailed me today and said he found it in building 1 i am saved how did 004 go
That’s some magic right there It was aight The practice quizzes were p helpfull	Yeah the practice quizzes are usually p representative Ik literally
Smurf :(((	Bro big sad :(( Idek what to do anymore
Looks like I might be doing a summer UROP honestly	Do u have one already Ugh I don't want to be on campus for three more months
Yea I might continue it Hm I’ll start looking at the xfair companies	:(( i was here all of iap so :p that emoji turned out too enthusiastic meh
I’m sure Boston over summer can be fun  Or maybe I’m tryna be optimistic haha	okok i appreciate your optimism haha submit your app!!!!!
I didn't end up applying bc I realized I have too much going on this semester :(( are you reading apps rn?	Sas Andyeah We just finished
oo nice how were the applicants this semester	pretty good gotta make some hard decisions tmrw
Mmm How was your weekend??	haha it was alright i was just doing hack all weekend so i didn't really have that much time to do my hw have u taken 036 before
Hey Jamie! I was thinking about making you CTO if you are ok with that? We are all cofounders	hey audrey sounds great what c suites are u guys
After I came up with the idea mindy helped with a lot of the coordinating stuff :) so she is gonna be our coo!	oh i just talked to mindy and i think there's some confusion about this since it's a little early to be deciding this too lol maybe we should talk about this together at our next meeting if that works for u we should probably also get a mvp up as our first priority before this before making the structure rigid
Hey Jamie, I know you said earlier that you were interested in running for management in StartLabs. I think you would be a great candidate, so if you are still considering, I highly suggest you put in a platform. Let me know if you have any questions. Goodluck!	hey caleb thanks so much yeah i've been looking at adit's reminders and thinking about running i was actually going to submit a platform today, probably in finance how long should our speeches be on sunday? also i might have to leave a bit early there's some mandatory externshiip meeting i have to attend :pp
Great! The speeches will probably be capped at like 90s -120s We will try to keep everything quick so we can get through	Okay sure thanks
Congrats on management!	thanks so much caleb i'm excited!
Hey, are you interested in coming to Germany?	Hey I really want to go yeah but I'm not ready to commit yet because I might already be going to Germany this summer for a MISTI
Do you know if Neha is busy / abroad for IAP? I’ve been trying to contact her for some time and shes been unresponsive	She's doing GTL Italy
Ah, that makes sense Have she been responsive to you	Uhhhh not really Although I've been seeing her call in on hack meetinga I only have her messenger tho and I can only assume she hasn't been on facebook
"Cool! I’ll put it in the doc Okay I think I put everything down, with some of my ideas (which are pretty bad but whatever) 
If I missed anything, I think you can edit it"	Lol no worries yeah I'll take a look Wait why is squirrel girl ashley I like shortie better for kako We might need to find a better one for morgan
"Oh yeah definitely
I put that cause she’s easily distracted like a squirrel?
Your ideas a much better, feel free to change anything"	Lol no I like it Hmm well let's try to come up w the other ones first Hmm well let's try to come up w the other ones first
Hey Jamie, could you send your mothers phone number? My mom wants to get in contact for a tournament or something 🤗	Oh for us or for adults? Cuz my mom doesn't play tennis 2487679354
No, I was wondering if you want to play on the 22 in the morning Sorry I totally missed that part 	Oh for a tournament? I'll check and let u know Yeah that works Whats like the approximate time range
Normally it’s 8, but there’s nothing specific	Got it I'll have. To start fixing my sleep schedule then
Lmao same	"hey catherine did the paper plates turn out alright also here's what i've got on my agenda for tomorrow -senior/captain speeches
-paper plate awards
-coach gift
-recap videos what order do u want to go in i have something in my speech connecting to paper plate so i would prefer those two are together but everything else we can rearrange also lmk if u want to give a speech also what are u majoring in again?"
"Ah sorry, I turned off notifications
I think the paper plates turned out pretty well
I don’t mind the order at all
I can give a speech, since I guess it’s sorta awkward to not give one 
Oh, I’m also majoring in computer science"	that's ok no worries okay that's great i'll see u tmrw and we can sort them when u get there yeah i was just curious about the recap video should it go first or after does first make more sense? yeah write a speech i'll be giving one too and i think morgan is as well ok computer science got it
"I dunno, I feel like the recap video might be a good way to end the banquet on a nice note, I think last year it was near the end (?) 
Yeah, I’ll try my best with a speech"	alright cool i'll leave it at the end then u can make your speech about anything btw as long as tennis related ig just kind of a final farewell i suppose u can talk about your tennis experience and whatnot advice as a tennis seniors idrk
I think I can come up with something , hopefully	aha yeah don't worry too much about making it fancy or anything just have some fun with it
I’ll try my best  As long as it’s not to bad right?	no worries i'm sure it'll be great
"Thanks  Hey, I was wondering if you want to practice together tomorrow?
My mom can ask for people we can play against together"	Yeah I'd be down but I have some stuff to do tmrw at 8, 11, 1, and 4. So I can hit from like 830 to 1030am if that works for you? I can also hit anytime after 630pm too
"I would really like to 8:30am, but I’m not sure I could wake up in time 
Does 7 work? It might be crowded at the high school though"	Yeah 7pm works for me Do u want to try for 7pm
Yeah, that sounds great	OK great see u tmrw then
Awww thank you! 	<333 what a god i've been stuck in a meeting all morning and all i want to do is watch commencement f

no, you have to do it all by hand	SAD
it's not that bad just think about a second hand first how many seconds => how many degrees	when u draw lines tho i have to set start and end points is there somethinig i can do w angle instead
yeah	oh okay cool
I mean, you can figure out the angle	math is hard ok i'll do that
and then do some T R I G O N O M E T R Y	SMH

good luck you got this	thanks gonzo
how it go?	uh i didn't change the wifi i just tested the request in the lab the request works but that's about it
aitht, that's a starting point	I suppose lmfao when i try to pass in a char into a func(const char *) i am getting a cannot convert ‘char**’ to ‘char*’ error and i've been kind of putting * and & everywhere and hoping it works ok nvm
wait rip I'm just seeing this I assume you figured it out?	Yep Still don't understand some of the exercises tho
Which ones I should be able to help	Discrete time and the one after that
Oh yeah discrete time is lit haha I’m doing readings rn but could do explanations later or tomorrow!	Okay sure ty do i need to be able to get a very specific request when i perform the GET on the etch sketch and also sometimes when i make the get requests it's returning me like one point at 32, 32 for some reason, although i'm never posting with that specific point
Do you initialize at any point with 32? And o don’t think so I think to concern is updating	U mean like making post requests? After a post request o reset the ball to 64 32 but that isn't 32 32 and I never post that point either It just returns that no matter drawing I make
Hm interesting, wanna send me your code using gist.github.com? (just copy it, put it into the gist, and I can take a look)	Oh okay cool I'm out rn but will do asap when I get back  sorry i'm getting back to u so late u don't have to look at it i already submitted the design exercise but just in case lol
I’ll take a loo tomorrow and let you know	ok cool tysm gonzo lol enjoy your friday evening
shit totes left you on read here, how's everthing with 6.08?	Lmaoooo All good I'm trying to do the most pythoney exercises tbh
pythony exercises are good	Yeah lmao they are so much easier imo
It's funny, it was the reverse for me when I was taking the class haha, but yeet you know where to find me!	Lmao aight will do I only have to do one more so
oh then youo're gucci	Yee
have you been doing your design exerciesse	Hopefully the 3rd one went well I got full points on the last two
we stan a 6.08 queens	Lmao this is no true
boo react only	I'm literally clueless Lab partner gods save me Every time
Well hey if there's fundmanetlas that are confusing I can helps with that There's apparently lots of people struggling so I just want to make sure no one is left behind	Okieee tyty Aw we love a caring TA gonzo i have a question about the regular exercises for power
What is up Oh right	i'm so fucking confused
What’s your kerb	jamiefu wait why
I can ft but I’m a lil drunk but I can explain	LMAO ok no enjoy your night it's all good i'll ask you tomorrow
K sent some guides Nah everyone left I’m just with me myself and I	oh man lol thanks gonzo you really out here helping me with 6.08 drunk damn
That’s what I do Let me know if it doesn’t make sense	ok haha tysm gonzo
Did it work	haha i'm trying to finish the 8.02 pset first but i looked it over and it looks pretty clear cut
That’s how I like it, clear cut	Ahaha tyty gonzo you saved me i LEARNED today
Yay glad it helped! Which Kat is on springfishies	Kat liu
RIP Kat Huang	Rip indeed
Can you provide a tl;dr for why y'all decided no? I'm just curious, don't worry won't tell her, I'm just sure she'll come to me since I was the one who pushed her to appply haha	oh um we thought she was really qualified actually but our reservations was about her being a team player and some people on team got the self-promoting vibe from her in the end we couldn't really take that many people on dev either so we just looked for fit
ah rip yah thanks that makes sense, she's done a lot so it's hard to balance telling that and asserting that	yeah sorry gonzo
"nah I'm gucci I'm outta here lol All i gotta do is say ""oh, rip, apply later, I did as a junior!"" congrats on survivng the decisions meeting though, I hated it last fall"	Omg gonzo Haha yeah it sucls that we have to do it
 Hey how you holding up on this 6.08 material? Saw you posting a lot on piazza	LOL outed Yes I have been Posting on piazza Uhhhh Well I just sort of took 2017 and 2018 today Most of my confusion is around power and cycles I'm gonna do 2019 tomorrow during the day And it'll be MC so hopefully I can me@nder my way through it Just ready to be done lol
I can help you with power	OK I just got up But I posted a q on piazza yesterday regarding this So I'll check there first In a bit hi gonzo i have a question so i'm doing 2019 rn and mostly just doing the power questions but i don't really understand 1F and how to know how much current a battery gets to charge
"Ok, I’m on my
Way to pick up my hearing aid from the audiologist I’ll straighten you out once I’m back should be no longer than 30, is that fine?"	oh yes take your time tysm :DD
Picking up food but can walk you through it via FB audio	what kind of food lol it's all good i can wait until you're back
The video chat ended. Well I heard the exam ate shit when it came time to take it lol You get it figured out? (i can't help just making sure you're good to go with it)	yes lmao the whole site ate shit poor joe i did it after joe released it again that night there were some things with string formatting i was a little confused about so i'm leaving it in the back of my mind and i'll come back to it on fri
So sounds like you’re Gucci on power? ;)	;)))) yessir it was honestly better than i expected
Amazing, glad you got it	i think so???? but joe could be a tricky fellow thank u for asking gonzo!
Of course :)! Is the zoom lit	Moderately U missed the intros Were about to start skribblio
"Hey Jamie!! i was wondering if you'd be interested in doing Hacklodge? Sorry for the super late notice as the application is due April 24th-- I was thinking of teaming up with you, Archer Wang, and possibly another person. I think we can end up making a super cool product and would be excited if you can join
Here’s the link: "	oh hi lol yeah another friend who went before recommended it to me too i didn't really have any ideas for a project tho so i wasn't sure let me think more on it today i'll let u knkoww
alright sounds good!! apps are due tonight, so lmk soon!! hey Jamie, just letting u know that Alex Quach just joined the team. we're gonna make a 4 person team, and we'd love if u could join !	oh cool lol aight i'm down i'm down is the app long also are we even gonna be able to travel by the end of the summer lol the app looks like they're asking if we have  project in mind tho
Thanks jamiee	You're very welk Hope it was a good one
It was great lmao	Parfait
What does that mean	I think perfect in french But I haven't taken French in two years So I think I may be wrong
Damn undedicated	Baguettes are overrated
They honestly are	did the bio people send you your location for tmrw yet
????????	oh shit wrong david mb LOL
LMAOOOOO I'm dead	i swear i clicked the other one
MIT student right here	smh don't do me like this
It’s at 12, but I can’t make it today. I was thinking of just reviewing the jupyter notebook on my own in like an hour (like when it gets released) It’s in 5-234 though ^	Shouldn't it already be released I have recitation at 10 but I don't want to go lol OK thanks tho
Oh maybe it is then haha Np! I mean I feel like I’d rather go through the rec problems by myself anyway As opposed to being walked through it	Haha fair enough DEV STAY IN FINANCE
Wait whaattttt For SL?	yeah boi
I am staying in finance!	yessssss
What made you think otherwise?	just making sure
Yep ofc :)) Should be hype af	bro it better be yo i just saw your slack message do u know around what time ryan is gonna be teaching the class
Yo! I believe it’s around 2 PM 2-3:30	aw okay i don't think i'll be able to go then but sounds interesting meeting link for today: meet.google.com/yyp-cxjc-ggg Come to finance
Hey Jamie! A few questions about SL First off, finance meetings don’t work for me on Wednesday evenings right now because of some hard conflicts, but I def want to contribute, so I was wondering if you do a meetings doc like hack does so that I can stay up to date	ok sure yeah i took small notes last week it's alll inthe google drive under finance unfortunately no go links can u take on a grant like de florez
Sure, when is it due? Is everything in the drive?	sorry actually can u do the finboard budget defense by march 2 for that finboard.mit.edu i can forward you the details
Yes!! Thank you 	forwarded dpatale right
Yep	cool don't worry about negative balance we've settled it with sao
Yo Is the budget the balance sheet? Or separate doc?	yes that is it
Coolio Also Do we have a count Of how many members I think Brendan sent a spreadsheet a few weeks agio But I can't find it ago* Also, did you attend treasurer training lol	no lol when was this r u coming today members for what
Idk it just asked On the finboard app And undergrad members Just like how many people we have in the club	oh around 40 and 25 active
And no I can’t- hard conflict with HUCP But I’m tryna get work done on my own time Such as rn with the budget defense lol	ok that works yeah as long as it gets down
I’m gonna put you as the club contact What’s your keep *lerb **kerb Jk we’re good Oh wtf is this budget defense shit lmao Wait tbh I’m not sure how exactly to defend our budget because I’m not as familiar with what our initiatives are as you or someone on exec would be So what should I do about that?	Can u fill out everything except the initiatives and pass along to me I'll discuss with Brendan about the rest Would be amazing going to idea factory saturday right?
You mean everything except the budget defense one pager?	Uh is that what the budget defense is The initiatives? I can't look at it rn But actually I know there's a sample budget defense in the knowledge base We can honestly just copy paste from there
Wait where is that?	
Kk perfect Thanks!	Yep lmk if u have any questions can u come at 1pm today
Yes I’m almost there Came from mit medical	Wait what lmao What happened to u
Lol no just wasn’t feeling well So I went in the morning But you know how it be with appointments taking forever 	Aw OK hope u feel better soon dev is the finboard app in
"I filled out everything But I don't see a ""Submit"" option anywhere? So does it just automatically send it to Finboard? But yeah, everything is filled out according to the budget and budget defense Wanna look it over?"	yeah i'm on the online budget form portal rn
Kk cool	but i can't see anything for either of our two accounts
Account number 2860286?	uhhhhh wait that's not either of the two accounts listed for us but i'll look anywhere anyway
Wait yes it is	oh i see it now it that's so weird
Haha	ok it looks good
"Coolio! I limited the content of the budget defense bc they wanted a page And ours was 3 So i just put some stuff about the goals and then just copied the paragraphs outlining what we're requesting from them and why Also, the website says There is no need to hit a ""Submit"" button for the entire application as the individual pieces are saved automatically."	yeah as long as there's like reasons for why we need money it's godo
So I think we're good to go Yep	yep thanks dev!
Ofc! Lmk what else you want me to do :)	lol will do it's really great that u got this done tho so once isaac and ruben get back to me on their stuff i'll modify our to dos
Coolio :) I'll start workin on it thanks a lot!!	yeah np
oh, I dont know if shuxin told you this, but I might need like a post request to either user/score so that I can update their ready state	"u can post to score.py with ""ready"" as a request body now make sure u write as ""True"" or ""true"""
ah, gotcha	yeah np i'm in the middle of updating the spec with the new changes but it'll be ready soon in the meantime if u have any q just ask haha hey donald if u have any changes u need me to make for syncing lmk so i can put it on my to-dos for this week. shuxin already talked to me about prompt, guesses, and drawings.py so i'll be making some changes there as necessary. also have an endpoint for dropping all tables at the end of the game on my list as well.
Hey Jamie! Hope you've been doing well  I'm a friend of Eric's from high school, and since his birthday is coming up, I wanted to make a video of all his friends saying something nice to him or talking about a favorite memory. Could you send me a 30 second video (recorded horizontally) at yupu.cai@gmail.com by this Sunday?	Heyyyyy Yeah for sure yay I'm so excited Thanks so much for providing me this honor haha
Lol ofc!! Eric said you and Anjalie have really been there for him in Boston and ik yall mean a lot to him	oh btw anjalie and i are roommates and we were thinking of doing a video together (we can make it 60 seconds then?) i'm not sure if that works for you lmk cuz we can still do separately
yeah that's perfect!	yay cool :))
Hi! Just a quick reminder to plz try to send the video to me soon!	Oh shittttttffff anjalie and I weren't together like all weekend okay wait no were gonna do it today promise I just texted her
You missed a video chat with Gautam.	oh shoot wait wya hold up i'm with the family rn
You missed a video chat with Gautam.	Hey happy birthday gautam
thanks! how's mit	It's pretty cool I'm learning a shit ton and trying not to die half the time but it's fun so far
you guys have pass fail now right	Yessir I feel like it's not a mindset to get trapped into tho But it's nice to have the comfort of pnr
yeah what are you taking?	This semester I'm taking rhetoric, computation structures, discrete, and programming
nice do you think you're gonna do cs	Yeah for sureim gonna major in cs Not sure if I'll also try some ee or what field I'll actually end up in But like it's widely applicable so I feel like even if I went into like business or smth it'd be aight
yeah for sure discrete was a really fun class how's the social life stuart used to complain a lot about it	I am not a huge fan of discrete but I think its somewhat interesting
i'm actually a ta for it now at penn lol	Uhhh I'm not a huge partier so I feel like it's aight Oh shit really Damn gautam go off
i didn't party at all freshman fall	Lol and thennn
then i started in the spring i didn't go that hard tho	I haven't seen Stuart at all lol
a lot of my friends complain that mit social life is too centered around drinking i mean it's definitely like that here too at least on the weekends	Uhhh I think that a big part of it is the frat parties yeah Which is a lot of drinking But I think like once u get involved in an org on campus it's like pretty nice
what did you get involved in	Uh so I'm doing hackmit, women business leaders, startlabs (which is like entrepreneurship), and club tennis I meet a lot for hack And club tennis is practice and good exercise and I like the people
i'm in club squash not a big fan of the people	I don't like hang out with most of them outside of club but Still cool Oh really lol
i mean	Is it just
i never really liked the squash community	U don't like them
but i liked the sport well tey're not bad i just don't particularly vibe with them	Oh so r u still sticking with it
they're not annoying or anything yeah	Hmm OK I see R there people u do like in other stuff you're doing
yeah the tas for discrete are all pretty close i like them a lot i'm also pledging a frat but it's like a chill frat so we don't have to do anything crazy	Wait that's so cool I think that the TAs for discrete here are relatively close too I'm not doing well enough to TA for it tho lmao Ah yes the Penn frst
yeah i tried really hard since it was just fun for me	Frat Gotcha
we don't have to drink in pledging which is nice	I'm also trying but I'm also bad so Big sad That's good lol
i'm doing really bad in school this sem tho	Oh that's unfortunate Why do u think so
i'm not really sure i'm not that great at showing up to/paying attention in class but i managed to cram effectively last year and it didn't work at times recently	Hmm ok Yeah i think waking up for class will be a problem for me eventually
i'm prob gonna visit boston during my spring break	Oh that's awesome I don't know if I'll be here tho Startlabs is trying to go to Germany this spring break and high-key would go since I've never been to Europe before
do our breaks overlap tho	Oh perhaps not No clue Should check
yeah they don't	OK cool so I'll be here when you're here Mindy siyoung mulan amber we all out here chillin I see Mindy and siyoung a lot actually
i briefly saw mindy when she came to penn revisit i also think i saw siyoung across the street but she never texted me lol	Oh huh lol OK wait I gotta go to sleep I think that u should As well But Idk when u usually sleep so
Yes I will first try to tweak Finn’s model. Then try to implement my own in Pytorch	oh i see what exactly is finn's model in pytorch again as far as i'm aware i didn't think it was an lstm i thought it was a dense network
It’s not I will tweak it to add an LSTM later *layer	OH i see finn's code is word embedding rn right what else does it do
It has an NN following that	i thought that nn was used to create the word embeddings tho as far as i'm aware maybe can u explain the architecture and purpose of the nn to me? just so i can understand the context of our project better
The NN is the classifier Word embeddings is the Embedding layer	oh interesting maybe i'll take a look later
Hello Are you in the HackMIT committee?	yeah i'm one of the co-directors!
Is it happening this year?	yes, we haven't released an official announcement yet about our plans for this fall, but it will be happening!
Is the team selected? Team of directors I mean Or volunteers	we'll be doing recruiting again in the fall, but if you're already on TechX you're welcome to volunteer
I am not	i'll be the director until next hack cycle
I wanted to	feel free to apply this fall! we'd also love for you to mentor this fall too more information will be coming out soon, so look out for that
Sure! Thanks! I coded up the LSTM last night It’s in deepNN.py in GitHub	Yep I saw your message I looked at your code how are you preprocessing the articles and labels I looked inside your processing and tag files but it looks like you're just making a list of 594 with 0…593
No that’s the heading I added the heading for the tags in the csv file so that it’s easier to access the columns data processing.py has the processing for the text The tags are just bag of word vectors. 1 in places where the corresponding tag is present. 0 ow	Oh I see so the labels are one hot for all 590 some labels OK I see And how r u doing the text
Not really one hot. There can be multiple ones	Uh yeah Right
Text is a bag of words vector too	Hmm how big is your vocabulary so far
Then I am adding an embedding layer to reduce that So far 9256	Because as far as I know the embedding layer takes in indices of words inside a vocabulary So the way u format the bow vector might not be compatible
I think it can take both? I’ll look into it Else I’ll change it	Yeah I had some confusion about this as well so I did some research and I thought it had to be a list of indices I have a code in my directory as well For lstm U can look if u have time It's just under a ipynb Jamie/c/lstm.ipynb Also how are u accessing the GPUs for running code
the first two lines in my code torch.to(device)	Oh okay I'll take a look I'm not on my computer rn
Fixed my code to have indices now	That's awesome I can look sometime later Lol working on a weekend you're so ahead of the game
That reminds me Do you just bucket your hours? Or is it okay to put weekend hours too?	We're limited to 40 so I just put 8 a day on weekdays Cuz that's just easier it doesn't need to be very specific U could do 8 on weekends if u skip a weekday too
Yeah it’s over in actuality anyway	"Yeah ikr lol Too bad there's no ivertime i'm getting ""cpu"" when checking for torch.cuda_is_available() are u getting cuda or something"
It will be cpu if not gpu I think	Yeah I'm getting CPU but Were u able to get gpu
I did not run it on Euler	i see hey haimoshri did u run into any floating point exceptions while training every time on backprop i run into this after a few batches but not sure why this occurs when we compute loss
Nope Don’t get them	i think i found the issue
Could you push your LSTM code on GitHub?	yeah sure i'll do it sometime today
If I close my terminal, will it stop whatever I was running in Euler	yes your connection will close we don't have tmux on euler we should ask max if he can install it that will allow your session to extend beyond your connection
So if I want to run stuff, I’ll have to keep my laptop open?	Yea And you need to stay connected to the server Which is why we need tmux lol
I have been trying to run it But it’s getting disconnected after a few hours	yeah the connection is supposed to stay alive if you're running a process but if you run into an error or your wifi cuts out for even a second the connection is interrupted if your laptop sleeps that's also possible if you want to mention in next update meeting i can run a tutorial on tmux and ask max to add it to torif there's enough interest
That would be Amazon *amazing!	hey meeting is starting now for RUM
Oh wait I’ll join in a minute Hello! Is your LSTM running?	hey what's up it's not running on tor but yeah it is
No I meant is it giving results?	oh yes i saw that u had an issue of producing all 0 labels
Yes	i'm hoping to avoid that but it's a common ML mistake or issue i should say i haven't seen the results yet on my smaller test run tho i was getting around a .7 ish FPR
It’s not possible. It’s the data imbalance	oh wdym it's not possible yeah the data imbalance causes the issue
Did you try printing out the predictions?	on the small test yet yeah there were a few labels being produced
Even in small data sets mine isn’t. Unless it’s not training much. In which case, it’s still basically random	did u try adding the sigmoid layer also arun said he was having trouble with the loss function u can try BCE loss
I have the Sigmoid layer I have tried With BCELoss,	oh that's very strange what optimizer are u using
Adam/SGD	hmm and you'll still producing all zeros with either of them?
Yes It’s all zeros Even with a Deep Network	wait is this the BERT network those embeddings? and then through an LSTM
I have since yesterday tried various combinations of CNN, LSTM, Linear	or is it something else so you are using BERT to embed?
Both have the same problem This one also has the problem	that's super strange i'm not running into that issue yet as far as i know but another idea i was going to try is writing my own loss function that weights missclassifying 1's heavier u can just alter the bCE loss function a little bit and apply some lambda term to the 1 error part
I tried the tensor flow variation . Did not run it yet	i'll let u know more details once i finish training the current network on the full data though does tensorfllow allow u to weight your classes?
Yes. Some of them	oh interesting what did tegmark say
He didn’t reply yet	okay hmm let's wait for a bit then i'll check what's going on with mine later but it's still training
lol don't worry about it! thanks for reaching out and helping me!	lol yeah if u can't figure it out we can go over it together sorry for the confusion
I did You can now call each other and see information like Active Status and when you've read messages. I picked 12 on Saturday, I'm not sure if that works for you but you can change if you like	Yeah that works Can we move up your meeting to 1145am by any chance
That's still fine	ok great hey hillary just wanted to let you know that 1on1s are canceled this friday and saturday :(( lmk if you need anything or you just wanna talk - hope everything goes well in the next few weeks for you and stay safe!
That's alright, thanks. Stay well too	hey Hillary, just wanted to check in with you to see if you had any questions about dev or anything related to hack
Hey thanks, yeah, I actually do I got some notification emails from Notion that Justin assigned me to some tasks etc Maybe I should ask him but I was wondering which workspaces I should sign in to	yeah so i think jack already added you to our notion workspace so whichever email you got notifs from that's probably the one  here's our master board with the tasks all listed and those with your name under it are the ones you've been assigned i think it was also in a google doc that justin shared in the slack is there something you're missing access to? we just have the one hackmit workspace though to answer your last question
Ohh I accessed using my gmail, so that's why I could not see anything Thanks	oh i see yeah i think depending on which email he added it could be one or the other actually i'm going to text jack to see if he added you but for now the email that justin is using is hillaryt@mit.edu oh yeah you're good you're on it for ^that email
Yeah, I can the dashboard now *see Thanks Hey Jamie, I hope you're well I have a quick question I got a github url from which I can clone the repo for Appreader but it doesn't seem to be working 	Hey what's up So what's the error you're getting
404 not found	Oh yeah I'm getting the same thing weird It might be because it's a private repo Let me get on my laptop and check It's possible the link is wrong Did u try just going to  If u look up appreader from the list of repos we have there u should be able to find it
I had done so, but let me check again maybe I might have missed it	Hmm OK if u still can't find it lmk and I'll get in touch w justin
Yeah, I still can't find it Wait It was private like you mentioned	Oh so u don't have access?
I finally got it, I accepted the invitation	Ohhhh Ok R u good now Lmk if there's anything else confusing tooo
Sounds good Where can I get the link?	I haven't made it yet but look out for it in our slack channel on Saturday! meeting link for today: meet.google.com/yyp-cxjc-ggg isaac make sure to fill out our w2m 
Oh yeah! My bad been caught up with some stuff	no problem at all i'm super hosed this week as well
Done!	coooool Hey r u on your way
Ye Where we at	Old side in between the rooms
What Where’s the old side	Of stud 5 It's opposite the new side? Like the Athena cluster area lol
Ah	But don't go into that room there's like separate study rooms here too
Hey b You mind if I take lead in my head on This	?
If I take on this project thing Take lead *	Uh u mean like sourcing startups? I think it should be okay let's talk about it with other finance members and all team to see interest on sunday
sounds good	how is MTC funding going also i think members were pretty enthusiastic about VC and startup idea if u and ruben want to take point on that i would say go for it
oh has adit not reached out to yall? ill bump him i guess sounds good well take care of it	Cool thanks
Yuh Can’t make it Hella hella work	Ok Can u give me an update on MTC and startup things
No updates yet still trying to get a date going for the calls	Okay sure is this for mtc
Yo u going to surprise tonight?	Probably not alas
Bruh Whyyyy I need to see you before u leave	Don't worry you will But not today lmao
When!	We can make plans for sometime during the day between Wed and fri
I’m free thurs! Like afternoon/evening	Only afternoon evening? I'm usually wrapping up some stuff at home these evenings With my parents So I can be prepared when I go Early afternoon can work tho
Uh I hate how organized and good you are sometimes Still love you tho! What abt tomorrow	Lol I just can't really leave the house in he evenings otherwise my parents get upset cuz m not spending time w them I'm working like all day tmrw Happy birthday thot
Tanx when r u coming back imy	Thanksgiving break Life is hard here Hot r u How r u
Awwwww Call meeeee sometime and catch me up	Yeeee
Excuse me ur back? And u didn’t tell me	Heyyy Lol Yeah I am but Im here for like half a day So
Big rip	I didn't want to disappoint
:(	"I'll be back all ""Christmas break though so"
I believe we have a $400 budget So it should be possible	Ayeeeee Good stuff if u haven't gotten it yet i actually found a better deal 
Sorryyyy Andrew was being weird! Ignore him	Lol it's okay he does stuff like that quite often Hi I'm too lol
Hi Jamessss Did school start for you already?	No we start on the 4th
Ohh okay Wait what do you study?	I'm probably a computer science major Most likelu
Hi Jamie! I was looking on the Simons website and saw u worked w Dr. Duong last year? I was wondering what ur experiences were since I’ll be working w him this year :)	Hi what's up I was a cs / biomedical informatics kid r u as well Duong is a radiology professor but I did cs related radiology work
mmhm yeah me too imma ai/computer vision kid and i think the best application of that is lik medical imaging Did u work more w Dr. Wang or Dr. Duong?	Oh if u already know a little bit then you'll be A Ok Dr Wang basically connected me w a grad student in his lab w experience Teach tensorflow and stuff Duongs lab I probably worked w more cuz I mostly went to my mentor from Wang's lab for cs help but duongs teaches u all the radiology stuff If he's emailed u to talk already and u have a solid background you'll b fine
ahh icic idk we haven't emailed a lot? which is why i was kinda concerned...	Oh hmm when does the thing start again
did u decide ur project once u got there too? uhh thursday i believe	Duong usually does something w image segmentation on some radiology data
altho im from ca so im flying on tues	It'll be cool
ahaha yeahhh i hope so!!	He just tells u what you'll be working on basically You work at your pace but make sure to keep the lab updated
ohmygosh thats a relief i thought he would make me find a topic mm so u were assigned a grad student mentor who worked w u most?	Uhh but yeah u can email him before and ask him to set up a quick phone call to talk about the project or provide some background reading Uhhh my grad student from Wang's lab had a lot of work to do that summer and she was gone for a couple week s for a conference when she and I were in the lab at the same time I sometimes asked her questions U can ask anybody in Wang's lab questions tho I just did a lot of googling online tho
ahaha yeahh ill prob end up doing that loll	I'm assuming you'll be doing tensorflow stuff so u can learn from their documentation
dang itt i shoulda asked to call earlier and started on some background reading... i think he mentioned breast cancer so i was just tryna find stuff on my own...	Eh you'll learn it all there the basics are like a short meeting
mmm wait if u did tensorflow did u also use python?	Yeah tensorflows native language is python
eyyy yess i literally only know python	Some of the other kids use pytorch ik but Wang's lab uses tensorflow mostly it
scared they would use matlab or r or smtg loll yayayy	That's good I didn't lmao it was alright tho
ohh so u didnt have much experience gg into it?	For these segmentation things it's probably good to find some existing framework and apply it to your data
mmm okok	I learned some stuff beforehand but it was like foundational stuff I knew Java before so Python was like way easier to pick up and you're using the tensorflow framework for basically everything except data processing so u gotta learn the new methods anywags
mmm icic yeah python after java should be a breeze :) compared to the other way around loll do most ppl end up writing papers afterwards?	Lol I don't really know either tho it was like ap cs java Uhhhhhh
ahaha eyy issok same w me haha	Well duong might try but most Simon's kids just do it for the summer I think? Idrk Cux most of them are wet lab so And it'll be your senior fall so most kids just kind of wrap up Not sure
wait wdym duong might try? like he'll ask u to?	It's kind of up to duong he'll ask u if u want if u guys have substantial stuff probably
oooohh danggg ackkk gotta try hard noww how about lik research competitions?/ kinda the same thing? lik if duong is ok w it?	Lol just do your best 7 weeks isn't a lot of time yeah Uhhh yeah just ask him He's usually ok w isef and regeneron I think Kind if interferes w college apps tho if u ask me And results don't come out until way later But it can also be worth depending on well Idk Maybe the culture is different in Cali lmao
ahahaha yeahh 7 weeks isnt too long but needa try anyway :) mmm yeah a bit concerned for college apps too loll ig we'll see though it all depends on what happens tho so do u remember how the dorms and stuff were? oh also sorry for the massive amount of questionss its lik coming up and now im getting scared but thanks a lot this rlly helps :)	Haha no worries the dorms suck supposely but idrc so it was like alright theres no ac so bring a fan if u can or have your roommate bring one. we were in Benedict last year idk if that's changed There's pretty bad curfew and whatnot
oh LOLL but yeah ig it did cuz we are in Gray	Most people get over it or find a way around it but there's check ins and the CAs are quite strict Oh that's like Better I think Benedict is the worst so
oh eyyy niceee ahahaa	Yeah it's fun make sure u spend your first few days getting to know everybodh
lol for my summer program last yr they didnt let us wear sandals wo a backstrap anywhereee theres nothing weird lik that right?	Cux they throw u into lab right away so u kinda gotta just put yourself out there to meet everyone Uhhhh No But it's cold inside all the labs So u might not want to
ahaha mm oh wait what do u usually do on weekends?	Nothing Try to work
i think someone said there are some trips but otherwise just chilling?	There's some organized trips but they're like All of sbu camps Yeah Chill Eat Sometimes some kids have to go to lab lmao
oh shoottt hahahaa oH was there anyone who brought lik instruments and stuff?	U can if u want
mmm ill prob go and piss everyone off w it loll	Lol go for it
so you need to make a new quill account bc it prob wiped your old one you'll also need the sso key from whoever deployed it or if you have access to aws, you can look for the sso key in the quill environment file you just need to use that to update your local spectacle config	ah okay yeah so the account we already made and i'll look for the sso key or try to get it from shirlyn i think
lmk if you need help getting it, i think i still have access to the boxes	ok thankssss :)))
yee oh wait also, if you're an admin on quill go into the admin panel and whitelist whatever your localhost is in the sso area it'll only accept sso requests from whitelisted urls so in this case it'd prob be like  or smth like that	oh huh i see got it i'll try that hey jason how does @jwt_required work the set_access_cookies seems to be generating a token and that's the one i'm trying to use on postman but i keep getting msg: missing cookie access_token_cookie even tho it like exists
Yeah so when you do sso on browser, the set_acess_cookies tells your browser to store it and send it with every subsequent request to the server as a header Jwt_required checks for this header You just need to send the request through postman with the correct header and the access token I was tryna figure it out with Justin and jianna earlier today, but we never resolved it	wait yeah i'm legit so confused because i've been trying to send in like Authorization: Bearer <access_token> but like it just
They tried using the authorization header	does not work and that too i tried that too i also tried JWT <access_token>
Yeah so I remembered getting this to work over the summer on postman I feel like I remember using 3 headers But I don't remember exactly I can look a bit into it rn	is this like a postman thing or when we write the frontend do we need to do this too
Just postman	smh
The browser handles this automatically	smh smh
You could also just comment out the get_identity thing in the requests And just hard code a quill id To test on postman Then just reenable it to do integration tests with the frontend	how can i find like quill_ids for users
if you used the sso endpoint, it should create a user automatically in the User table and one of the fields should be the quill id so you can just look at the postgres db alternatively, you can insert a mock user and hard code the quill id for testing	oh i see
oh wait okay i think i remember what i did so i think the reason the authorization header doesn't work is because the server expects the jwt to be sent through cookies not through headers so you need to set the cookies in postman which you can prob manually do, but i think i did it automatically by creating the user through postman requests	am confused but i was just gonna hard code the quill id for now but how do i list users in the db again
are you using the postgres cli?	yes
"if so, you should just be able to do select * from `user` you need ` ` around user ` because there's a default user table already which is different from user with ` surrounding it or """	oh wait so ` this doesn't woork but the double quotes worked i got it i'm going to try now
okay cool cool if you wanna try the cookies way i was talking about basically this line of code saves the access token in your browser's cookies  and if postman receives this, it will also save it in its cookies so if you can modify that function so it doesn't need to do the sso and just gets you the access token for a specific user it should save the proper access token in postman's cookies so all your subsequent requests should work for that user but you'd need to modify the function to get rid of the sso checks for testing	o woow ok so like the /login endpoint but w/o the sso stuff how would u get response then oh jk i'm dumb
so all you need to create the acess token is the quill_id	yeah lmao aight cool
lmk if that works or not i'm like 80% sure that's what i did or like it's prob fine to just hard code the quill_id to replace get_identity	ok it worked thank you very much jason kung you are the best thank you
LOL np which way did you end up doing?	both first i hard coded it then i set the cookies
Heyy Not sure if you remember me But you’re on an organizer at hack mit?	hey what's up sorry can u remind me where we met again i feel like your name sounds familiar lmao but i'm kind of brain dead atm but yeah i'm on the organizing team for hack
Er I think you’re friends with some of my church friends	wait r u at umich
I don’t exactly know? Aaron? Isabelle	oh shit yeah yeah we have met right
Tbh, I don’t quite remember either Anyway it doesn’t matter lol	lol nice what's up
I’ve definitely seen you once I forgot where Um not exactly lol. I work in LA as a software engineer I used to be an organizer for mhacks	ohhhh i see
And a developer as well for them Wondering what you’re doing for HackMIT their website is very impressive I’ve read through it before lol	lol our hack website?
Yeah Backend and front end code	ohhh have u been looking at our open source
Yup	it's not well maintained rn but yeah that's from a few years ago
It was fine a few years ago	quill is probably the biggest project we have but it kind of needs a rewrite not sure if we'll do that
Are you a developer	yeah i'm on the dev team but i'm still sort of learning rn and doing things as i learn
Yeah still, was pretty impressive as far as college undergrad goes I mean it’s not your full time jobs	thanks haha we try
Ok haha, nice. I’m glad to see people in Novi branch out tho I know max and rohit did a lot back in the day I did android dev for them But anyways, want to say that it’s actually great and really valuable. It’ll help you out a lot for your internship search	aha yes i know max p well
Yeah I helped him out when he was starting to organize the hs hackathon	yeah nhacks is p cool i haven't been but a lot of friends have gone
It was interesting lol. How much you can do with no money at all MIT got fat stacks Or at least our big data overlords do Yeah it was actually impressive I didn’t imagine it could be done lol I mean all of the projects aren’t really worth a damn	u mean from nhacks? i don't know much about it but yeah they worked hard
AH thanks jamie I’m excited!	Yay that's good Yeah so I'll let u know more later does the 17th work for u for a phone call w national office how does 10am pst or 1pm est sound

Lmao “we love tennis”	u can log on now and take a peek around if you want mostly it's just communications stuff yeah they ask me to keep it the same so technically they have access to it too as for like the registration system and volunteer sign up i can just show u sometime
Cool ok I’m pretty much free like all the time so just lmk whenever u want to go over stuff	and i'm pretty sure u saw the doc before u applied with all the responsibilites stuff so that's pretty comprehensive too
Oh yeah I did	yeah so beyond that it's just kind of figuring it out real time i think i'll help u plan the august one but u can pick the dates so it works around your schedule
Alr sounds good I’ll start looking through some dates and we can plan it soon Also for equipment am I gonna store it at my house or are u gonna keep it until u leave	we should probably start moving it over to your house once the session starts or before if i can't be there on the first day up to u
Ok once we figure out the dates and if u can come we can decide	u see the email rachel sent today? asking for dates for the fall no rush but just making sure uk
Yeah I have some dates in mind but I need to go over them with my parents. My cousins are over rn but they leave tomorrow night so on Thursday are u free to call? I would just wanna go over the dates with you and figure out anything else we need	yeah whenever or we can just talk at practice assuming you're going

should I email Rachel the dates or do I need to email the parents first to see if the dates work for most of them? Should I just email the parents the dates and then ask which times?	Since Sundays work for u just email Rachel the dates Feel free to sent the times in stone too Then email the parents once there's a registration link
Ok thank u will do Hey do u have a list of the kids who need a coupon for the fall session? I tried looking through our drive for a spreadsheet of who came to each session but I couldn’t find it

Yessss our volunteer interest list is growing 🥳 I’ve got a friend from Farmington who is spreading it to her team so hopefully they pull through	Oh shat that's good stuff
Is there a way for me to see which kids have registered for our fall session?	Yeah you'll get a confirmation email from regFox U can also go directly to the regFox website portal to check
Uhhh well now I’m nervous. We haven’t gotten any emails Tomorrow I will email parents individually Do u have a link to the regFox portal	OK yeah dw it's still early U look up in the inbox registration confirmation to see what a typical confiromation looks like  hey are u sure that rachel's opened up registration cuz there's no camapaign on regfox yet ok yeah it looks like she has maybe it's cuz no one has filled out a form yet  alright u can also login from here
Should I send another email to all the parents that sets a deadline to register? Or should I email parents individually	the email is noviaceingautism@gmail.com and the password is Welovetennis1 yeah u should set a deadlines make it like one week before the start of the program but in actuality the thing doesn't actually end then
should I start sending emails to parents individually The only kid to register so far is addison	Yeah good idea Try to get some new kids too
Alr so I sent individual emails to everyone on the interest list. Now I’m thinking of who else to reach out to. The flyers haven’t come in yet, but once those do we can definitely head out to some centers and spread the word Have u ever directly contacted the special ed director of northville?	Okay sounds good No I emailed bt Never talked o called U should try callig
Yeah I’ll do that. And if she doesn’t pick up I can text her and hopefully she responds	alright sure it might be like a school phone tho
Maybe but no harm in trying	Agree Hey all the stuff is ready at my house u can come anytime to pick it up ^^ i can drop it off at your house too honsetly
Sorry sorry I’ve been busy with Brianna’s grad party all day. I’ll talk with my mom and I can pick up some time next week	oh no worries sure just text me so i'm at home when u plan oon coming how r u doing with registrations
I have had like 2 more register and then like 2 more of the parents email me that they plan on registering their kid I definitely need some more tho	Alright good good Yeah hmmm

Kinras We were in charge of sandwich money	Oh Hmm Ok I'll ask them How we doing on numbers And did u get in touch with north ville folks Wb centria and other places
We only have 5 kids registered rn. I emailed the people from Northville but they haven’t responded yet, and then I emailed Centria but it sent an automatic email saying that Alic won’t be back until the 5th. Also, my mom and I saw this thing at the library about a guy with autism who is going to talk about his book to parents of kids with autism on the 8th so I’m tryna see if I can get the library to let us post a flyer there	OK sure U can talk to them in person too Like all these autism centers Just visit the ones nearby
Ok I’ll try going on Monday when they’re all open. Would u wanna go together if ur free? If not it’s ok	I may be able to but most likely not sice I have to take my brother to tennis then I have tutoring
Ok well lmk if u wanna go in the morning or something	The morning I definitely can't but like between tennis and tutoring I mght
Ok so around what time?	Wait u should just go in the morning without me because i don't want to make u wait if I'm not able to make it I will meet up with u later if I can and you're not done yet Because my time range is very limited in between the two
Ok sounds good.	Yeah I'll text u tmrw hey jenya sorry i've been off the grid for a while how are you doing with preparation and everything also is regfox working for you i can't see the summer registration campaign on there for some reason
I’m doing well, we have 10 kids registered rn and I have a good amount of volunteers. I got some shirts from celina when she dropped off all the stuff, and ordered some more last week. Also i didn’t see the summer registration on Regfox so I have just been looking at the emails and keeping track of participants and volunteers on a spreadsheet in the drive	Oh dang I see maybe we should ask Rachel about that That's good Maybe for the first one we can talk to all the volunteers but if u end up having more volunteers than u need it's OK to schedule some for one day and the others for another day that way we're not overloading and they're not just standing there Did dwip text u at all btw
Nope	Lol typical I mean what
I have 20 volunteers who responded to the doodle for this Sunday so we should be good. I’ll text them all to make sure they’re coming	Okay great that's a good number
there’s a 30% chance of rain at 6am tomorrow. I should wait to push it back tomorrow in the morning after looking at the courts right?	Yeah u can be there around 815 or something to decide?
Yup	Yeah okay I will check with u around 830
Hey how long do usually do each activity for? Like how long do u run volleys until u call ball pick up	10 to 15
Hey volunteer hours are now submitted through a google form and one of the questions is the supervisor name? What name should the volunteers put?	One of your parents ig Or lowes if he's willing
Ok I’ll just use my Dads name	Okk Hey happy birthday :)) how u doing
Thanks!! Junior year is murdering me slowly but it’s still fun Took the psat today 	haha that's good aye how'd it go
Honestly wasn’t that hard but we’ll see what my score says	is it feeling like a national merit semifinalist to you i think it is wait u took the psat on your birthday? damn i'm sorry that sucks
Yeah I did but that meant classes were shorter so I decided it was fine to ditch and went out to eat lunch with friends after the test	Lol that was a good move
Yeah, how’s MIT going?	Everything is hard But Whatever
Ope well hopefully ur still having some fun!	Lol yeah I am there's a lot to do Hey jenya just wanted to let u know the 3 singles girl from northville might be reaching out to u in the near future about volunteer8ng Also I never checked in How did last session go
Last session went really well. There were some problems with Chris acting up which u predicted would happen, but Celina was able to come and help out.	Oh okay yeah that's good Was he better by the end of it
Yeah it was more of just one week where he got super frustrated and just like lost it	hmm okay yeah did celina provide any suggestions regarding chris that's okay though in general though as long as the kids had a good time and u guys had a good time i feel like it's valuable in other news how is junior year of high school also i read your profile on the aceing autism page so sweet of u to mention me
Lololol junior sucks but it’s fine I’m getting through it	It be like that Sad Issok tho A better day is always coming
Wise words that were very much needed Hey for the 2019 spring session did you ever book courts at the sports club bc of rain? If so how did paying for it work	I did the spring outdoors but rain was always a problem heah I tried to get the sports club to give me some courts for a reduced fee or smth But they never would If you're able to book indoors though honestlu That's much better See if Justin can subsidize it
Ok thanks yeah I don’t really want to have to worry about rain every week so I’ll talk to Justin about the sports clubs	That'd be good yeah Lmk if u need anything
Hey so I’ve been talking to the sports club and they don’t have courts available on sundays until 2:30. I did a survey of the parents to see if they prefer outdoor from 10-11am or would be ok with indoor courts at 2:30 and it was pretty split but slightly more preference for the indoor courts  at 2:30. The only problem is that the sports club won’t let me book the courts until March when they figure out they spring classes, and there’s a chance they won’t have enough courts. The first date I’m planning for the session is April 19 after spring break, so do u think I should wait until March to see if we can get indoor courts or should I just keep the location outdoors from 10-11am? Sorry that was a lot lol	You can have Lowe's book The Outdoor courts first then wait until March because you're not starting until April anyways. if you can get them in March that would be great and then Lowe's can just cancel of Courts Yeah this was also my problem with them And why I couldn't get the courts
Ok thanks. Last time Lowes didn’t actually book the courts but just told me that if I needed to kick people off to just call him lol When u talked to the sports club were u talking to Taylor and mark?? oh also I’m going to the ACEing academy at the end of March so hopefully I’ll learn a lot there to help the program out	Oh lol nice I was talking to this lady that was program management of tennis Oh what's that I never heard of it But sounds amazing Where is it
It’s in Ft. Lauderdale. It’s the first year they’re doing it and it’s just like an aceing autism conference. Hopefully I’ll meet Justin and Rachel there	Is that in Texas? That is so cool then is it like training or PR or smth else
It’s in Florida at the Miami open. It’s a bunch of us program directors across the country coming together to discuss and learn how to improve our programs and there’s also a variety of key speakers coming.	Oh lmao had no idea where ft Lauderdale was That's really cool tho
LOL	Dude gotta watch
Why the girl look like she 12	She's actually 27 That's like 7 years older than Jackson Yee
WHAT THE ACTUALHOW TF	Yeah ikr
SHE LOOKS YOUNGER THAN ME	BRO IK

Isn’t that like illegal lol That sounds so weird	I mean Nothing is illegal in China And he's technically not a minor
yeah it’s so weird to watch I  approve	Yeah she LOOKS young tho
he’s cuter than I remember lol	Older than u remember
Yeah that too	He kind of had a glowup
Yeah I used to think he was the least attractive tf boy	He never looked youthful even back them

Alr maybe I gotta wait till the fall Thanks jams	I think it takes some time to confirm it too Honestly it's also pobably cheaper in a family plan So u should try that
I don’t know anyone to add to it thought quite yet Plus the student discount gets you these two streaming sites Hulu and showtime also do u know anything about MacBooks I’m gonna buy a new laptop and i have no knowledge	Oh shoot that's nice Will u have time in college Uhhh Idk anything about macbooks I like Amy's tho
alr thanks yeah I don’t know anything about them either lmao	Yah ask amy I think she searched up some
I just gotta know if it’s easy to get windows on it	Waht Macbooks run ios Idek if u can switch the operating system Might as well just get a surface of other windows laptop if u need windows If you're not doing heavy computation a surface should be fine for your purposes it's real light too
no I know but I need windows my freshman year for this one program and I know u can download it Hm	Wdym
Now I must think again	It's an operating system
This surface thing sounds promising yeah you can have both I’ve watched videos about it today lol	I don't even think u can change the os on a Mac book tho how is that possible wow
Idek how to explain	Loke If u run it on a VM maybe But that's so
They have this thing called boot camp assistant	Difficult
And it lets u download windows	Oh huh It looks like u need to buy a separate windows installation package or smth too That's quite wild I prefer windows just because I think it's more versatile but
Yeah you gotta pay though	Im not really sure
I just want a MacBook cause I already have an iPhone and airpods But lowkey that’s the only reason why And I know I need a new computer	Oh yeah lmao
Damn it’s moments like these I wish I wasn’t a grandma about computers	Idk anything either man Get something w 128G of storage I think boot camp and the windows installation need a lot of storage
yeah I need 256G at least yo for stats would u recommend regular lined notebooks or graph paper	Regular is fine U don't really graph as much as u think

wow you are nct Stan	lol rip i'm running out of things to do
I have been watching anime	but i'm too lazy to follow other groups
turning my attention from Korea to japan	what kinda anime LOL
attack on titan so basic	fr tho
but this guy I used to like told me to watch it	at least not naruto
LMAO	i see
it’s kinda scary though Or I am just little bitch	LOL what ITS AN ANIME
OK BRO THERES LIKE GIANT MAN BABIES THAT EAT PEOPLE	LOOLLL ok wait yeah i have heard of that dude my friend trained this bot to talk like him and i was like omg i gotta do that too so now i'm thinking should i
I like how u even know how to that But yes That seems so cool Does the bot respond Or just like repeat things	ideally it'll sound like how i talk the integrating with facebook messenger is trickier so i'm just gonna see if i can train it first
would you just have to feed it a bunch of sample data	and make a model that half works yeah
that is very cool	i'm downloading all my messages from messenger rn
mit is training u well	lol no i'm just being a copycat
can u believe we go to college	no
blows my mind	i've been sitting at home for half a year so no
this is true I left my house for the first time today to go grocery shopping ur roommate anjalie is nice my friend thinks she’s pretty do not reveal	ooooh guy friend?
yeah in gps too	wow she pulls
LOL did she at mit too	was it fun
yes because I bought so much junk food My mom has made me eat healthy for 3 months My palette literally disappeared	my friend across the hall likes/liked? her what is palette
like ur taste for food goes to mit and forgets vocabulary	oh lol whoop dude
get some liberal arts education in there	i didn't know that was a thing i've never heard of it
you’ve never heard of people say like cleansing my palette	is gps keeping you busy yeah but
hell nah lmaoo	i thought that was just a phrase
I spend way more time on qfs stuff but I can recycle it for gps so it works out	damn the fuck your clubs actually teach u shit
wait how do clubs work for you then like what work do u do for them	most of our clubs here are like community based organizations like hack organizes hackmit lol and the other two i'm in are p shit rn you're supposed to learn from it
ohhhh ig kinda makes sense	but it's not very lelgit
how would a club like teach u coding I feel like that’d be pointless right	yeah lol i mean
since u hVe classes	if i had gotten into sbc i would have learned but alas i did not
what is sbc ‘‘Twas alright	sloan business club it's like the only business club on campus
ohhhh to be fair in my opinion you do not want to be in finance I also would not do it	LOL
If I had the capacity To be smart in other things But alas	i feel like that's false you have to be smart for finance
I think there’s a low barrier to enter finance And a high one to advance	wdym enter
Whereas like comp sci a lot of people just don’t have the facilities to even attempt compsci like anyone can study finance but maybe not end up with a great poi’s iti on position but compsci and math and science too hard for some people to even try	oh definitely not everybody here defaults to compsci
that’s literally the reason why I’m not an engineer Ok well people at mit are smart	once they realize that chemistry isn't getting them anywhere
In general HAHAHAHAHAH	LOL wait no
THATS SO FUNNY	you're definitely smart enough and besides finance is tough too you have to wear suits and talk to people and understand numbers
I’m not tryna work 110 hours a week But alas	true lol you're gonna go gray early
are you taking me you can’t do those things telling	haha precisely anyways if it helps
🧢	i'm trying to minor/double in finance at some point cuz i need to learn about money probably
LOLLL money do be important	later this summer i think i'm gonna start learning about some nice stocks and maybe try some investing on robinhood i'm scared of losing money tho lol
I will advise u if I can No charge	ooooh i'm blessed
honestly just don’t do options	LOL what is options
so like you know how you can buy or sell a stock you can also make a bet on whether or not a stock goes up or down and you pay a lot less for that but in return there’s a lot more risk so lots of students invest in options bc less capital required but lose it all	damn who's paying you if you're right about the bet tho lol
brokerage same thing with if you buy or sell a stock	wait what is a brokerage
so for whatever action you want to take someone else has to be on the other end right	yeah
if you wanna buy a stock someone has to be willing to sell well it’s too hard	yeah
for people to individually match that up	brokers like facilitate that right
yeah	but why would they pay you if you're right
brokers make money from facilitating trades not from being right on the market like brokers already get paid for matching people up	yeah
they have to pay you with basically the other person who’s on the other sides money but brokers charge a premium for their services so that’s where they make money because if you aren’t guaranteed the money if you’re correct nobody would trust brokers	wait yeah so if i'm trading options there's someone else on the other end that is betting like a stock will move in the opposite direction i'm betting right
yes	so that someone else is the person actually paying me if i'm correct
yeah technically you just don’t know who that person is it’s like their money though	ok yeah hmm so the broker is taking both of your money and being like whoever wins gets most of this and i keep some portion of it that's funny that u mentioned options tho anjalie wants to trade options in like the future as a profession
oh yeah that’s what quant is I’m p sure that’s what she wants to do quant makes hella money my friend is gonna make 350k	wait quant trades options?
Right out of undergrad	fuckkk
most quant shops yeah	i don't think she wants to be a quant tho
oh hm most options traders though trade for providing liquidity not like actually investing to take a directional position on a stock	what does this mean
anyway I estimate big bucks when you’re trading it’s because you have a view on where a stock is gonna go but if you have a shit ton of capital you can just act kinda like that broker and fulfill a bunch of people’s orders who are trying to buy and sel stuff	oh so why is that quant then
and make money ensuring that you match everyone up and everyone’s orders can be executed bc it’s about like designing programs and analyzing data not so much like research and writing pitches and whatnot	oh yeah but is it considered being a broker then cuz as far as i know
yeah the formal term is market maker I don’t know too much about it but I think they’re p similar	quants just use data to estimate when they're buying an undervalued stock and reselling and like true market price right
quants develop strategy’s based off of data so u can do like pairs trading which is like multiple stocks and how they’re in relation to each other not just like a stock just any algorithm strategy that uses data as the trigger to execute	uhhhh am confused but ok
loll I’m not that good at explaining but basically take ur definition and just make it broad using a strategy to make money doesn’t have to be with stocks can be any asset class	wait do u want to explain to me what asset classes are and what types there are because like
oh ya just any asset u have stocks or equities bonds commodities	i've been meaning to learn this
foreign exchange	what is stocks vs equities
same thing Real estate is one and then like the other which is alternative investments and that’s like complicated products and stuff I haven’t really learned	hmm ok i should learn this at some point i feel like lol
most people trade stocks just because the other asset classes take a lot more learning I’m sure you’d learn this if you took like a couple intro finance courses like it’s new cuz we never learned this stuff	maybe i should just online course the shit out of this this summer but also
ya honestly there’s a bunch of free stuff on the internet that can teach u it Anjlaie could teach u lol	she could lol she's so busy all the time tho
wait with what	dude i have no clue
is she interning	i haven't talked to her for weeks yeah she's interning at a trading firm
oh that’s prob why	wait are you interning
interns work long hours nope I am relaxing enjoying my last free summer before I become slave	yeah that's true she's always been a diehard
is she super into finance and stuff or also compsci	she has more cs background but recently she's been doing a lot of finance and getting into that she's studying cs and econ tho good for you LOL
my friend at nyu went to hs w her and he said she was math god too op	yeah i heard that too

they make u pay for it ya the food slaps so hard	uh what the hell is that
insanely hard	LOL
like people just put shit on you then are like omg ur wearing it pay me 20	damn wtf
but u can avoid they target tourists	how am i supposed to not look like a fucking tourist i look like a tourist in my own home
HAHAHAHA I feel like if u aren’t there w a family or don’t look like a fob ur fine	nyu is full of fobs
this is true I hooked up with one I mean what	"haha i see you've picked up ""this is true"" as well I MEAN WHAT"
Wait what’s this is true is that something u sued to say	no it's just a lot of college students use it esp the cs kids
OH GOD	LOL
I don’t know a single cs kid NYU’s engineering school is in Brooklyn No so interaction with my ideal type So tragic	wait they're separate?????
Finance guys are aggressively type A	YOUR IDEAL TYPE IS AN ENGINEER?
Yeah only the engineering school YES I HATE GUYS AT STERN	LOL WHAT IM AN ENGINEER
BUT U ARENT A GUY HAMIE	engineers dress like shit tho can u handle that
bruh ofc	OKAY FINE BE SEXIST
I can bum it up all the time	LOL
so sorry	no judgement at all from them seriously people dress even more like shit than me at school which is great gr8
actually I did have a thing with this guy in stern and I was confused as to why I liked him and it turns out he’s switching to engineering	LOL
I knew I had a type	u felt it in your bones
yeah his personality was way diff from stern urs so I knew	yeah i def feel like all the mit kids are so laid back
can I make u a tinder account or hinge	about just like everything what is hinge LOL
hm really that’s interesting a better dating app than tinder	i have NEVER heard of it
College kids use it a lot more People are more serious on it Ok actually it’s an asian thing for some reason	bumble keeps coming to our school and promoting
Hella Asians use hinge HAHAHAHA WHT WHAT THE FUCK bumbles like ah yes mit our key demographic	they give u a cookie if u download the app
who could resist did u know	my roommate downloaded it while she was a thing with this guy
oh no bad idea did she see him on the app	she swiped a bit for fun she saw our other friend lol it was a fake account tho what were u going to say
oh ye quick tangent but related to humble bumble at nyu it’s like a thing that if you study it’s a econ bc u wanna be a banker but it’s much harder than if u study finance so this girl I know goes on bumble and has sex with all the bankers she swiped with to get connections	holyyyy
since she thinks it’s hard for her in econ and I was like well shi that’s questionable	thats so fucking intesne wait i'm confused u study econ to be a banker, and it's harder to study than finance is that what you're syaing
no like firms recruit from stern much less from econ majors in the school forarts and science so like econ majors have to rely on connections more to get a banking job	ohhh why would they study econ then
couldn’t get into stern	oh LOL damn
yeah it’s kindve a rip but stern has such a bad rep at nyu so everyone just avoids other schools anyway	???like other nyu schools
yeet	why do yall have a bad rep
everyone else is very liberal and artsy stern is very different and a bunch of people are assholes so naturally	:(( you're not an asshole
omg I’m blushing u aren’t either!!	;) i got you there didn't i
I heard at mit finance people are looked down upon like they’re the cop outs	"HAHA wait mit people are more conscious of their impact on society than i realized so all the finance kids and ""sell outs"" are looked down upon"
Ooo makes more sense	but then so many smart cs kids end up trading anyways
but also surprising about the impact thing	yeah it might also be a result of how admission officers get students i think their personal taste ends up getting a lot of community focused students but a lot of stuff on your application doesn't reveal the full person so yeah there's def a lot of sell outs even math kids who move to cs are considered sell outs
wait wtf	but that's a different type of sell out
this is too complicated	"that's like ""you didn't stay pure to your major and interests"""
selling out is very accepted at stern	LOL
it’s like bro we gotta make Mooney respect LMAO	that's the goal big bank
fax but doesn’t cs and math pay similar to banking	yeah perhaps??? i'm not too sure it might be a little less
bruh I’m trying to be a secretary like I love typing	yall working longer hours tho so i'm not opposed
and organizing	HELL naw don't let your talents go to waste
fuck this recruiting bullshit GIRL WHAT TALENTS I WANNA TYLE TYPE	i still remember deca u went in during lunch to organize papers dude you'd lose to all the cs kids
HAHAHA I was that bitch ok but cs kid Wants to be a secretary	i have a friend that types like 120

computer applications is what first sparked my passion	and i was like the fuck
ARE U SERIOUS IM FUCKING DYING HAHHHAHAHAHA where’d u work last summer I forget	LOL wait remember i was working at the country club coaching tennis we had to do like monthly invoices and attendance
Ohh ok	and after i did them too fast a couple times
I am actually laughing	he had me do them most out of all the other coaches for the rest of season
oh bruh Backfired	i know right
Intiative can hurt sometimes But it did get u to mit So we cannot complain	from then on i would make sure to eat while doing them or watch youtube LOL right my excel skills got me here
just as much as the frigistick got Leon to harvard u know he gets funding for that Crazy but also do u talk to the other novi people at mit or not really	yeah i saw he's getting hella money from harvard cuz they just have all this extra money to throw around sometimes ajay like never
o I forgot he went Oops	i talk to anjali the most probably then nisarg sad nobody got in this year
wait really I did not keep up with anyone Where are people going	yeah dwip and srihari both got waitlisted
that’s like out of the ordinary	srihari is going to harvard tho so that's chill
wel shi to study what chem right	dwip and ashley fan are going to pton yeah biochem i think
oh ye I heard Ashley went crazy like got in hella places	oh like where else lol
her dads in this WeChat group w my parents mans bragged hella	the only ivy was pton right
what no	i heard her dad lied
ok yeah that’s true too	from srihari
oh shit I told Zoe And Zoe told Srihari I guess IOPS	LOL rip
will keep mouth closed from now on but yeah I think he over exaggerated but def more than one ivy I think Columbia too	eh she applied to like over 20 schools
I applied to 5 and was exhausted by the end how is that humanly possible	idk she always gave me strange vibes
yeah like a 40 year old woman in a small body	yeah same i was like i'm not applying anywhere i wouldn't go over umich all the time dude
dude I would’ve take a lot over umich looking in hindsight I really did not want to go	you wanted to be out of state really bad tho right
ye also just didn’t want to go to college w everyone from novi bc this sounds like mean	dude sameeeeee
but like people I didn’t really respect or whatever would get into unify and it just grinded my gears to be like now I gotta see them again so we dipped and never looked back until corona rip	LOL i think that umich draws in a wider range but there are a couple really excellent people that go to umich too
And everyone ends up in like consulting So I wasn’t really into that Deca 2.0	just cuz they have so many consulting groups lowkey i'd get into consulting if i had the presentation skills for that shit
My slide decks are ass	yeah rip same
Leon told me his consulting club is just all bullshit and I was like yeah it’s hard to see ur impact in ur work	LOL
so it seems frustrating	consulting firms don't teach u shit but u make hella bank and u get to travel
well shit	i'm still considering it just cuz
Did not think of it like that	there's like a tech consulting side
yeah lots of people like that	and i want to be in management at some point in my life but idk i struggle with whether or not i really like it
I wanna work in hr lmaoo Hirin people seems fun	it's always nice to be the hirer vs the hiree
I also wanted to be a lunch mom at some point But now I don’t even wanna be a mom	you have lots of goals harder for you than for me
wait what U want to be mommy is that what that means	no it means that you're more likely to be one than me
ha ha I could picture u as mom	i honest to god don't think i will be married
me as well	like i can't tell if i just have unreasonable standards
idk how but my friends are always actively looking for a bf like how tf do u have time for that	LOL
I’m just tryna not to get fired	wait how the fuck do people stay in relationships
and they out here textin 5 dudes at once on tinder wait yeah I lose interest so fast bro	how the fuck do people get into relationships lol
nobody lives up to jfus standards	i still don't know
I think it’s so hard	LOL wait i'm pretty sure it's not that i think i'm just like
to find a mutual liking	not a person that matches anybody correct
u were the talk of the town in hs don’t front also is dongha moving or smth he keeps sending my snaps that are like depressed I’m leaving and I have no interest in asking him directly	HAHA WHAT no definitely not oh ye he's moving tomorrow actually
to where	his dad got transferred back to south korea

is international travel even like a thing	he'll be back for school in the fall yeah i think so lol
Korea seems lit	did nyu announce fall plans yet
we going back as of now	wait yeah saranya and i were saying we should go visit this summer
bc that expensive ass school keeps saying that losing money even though that is lies	damn mit still hasn't announced
at least it’s not bad news yet I think schools are just waiting to see what everyone else says honestly if they close campus I’m renting a house in Kansas And we all lie there live	LOL why kansas
and take online classes together Cheap housing	there's nothing there omg you'd die from lack of city
I still poor ok Hey I’m michigan born and raised I can survive At mit do u guys go to Boston often Or stay on campus	i don't go that often but like boston is across the bridge but it's not downtown so i go there to eat sometimes with friends i should go to harvard square more often tbh the food there is good
I once had this ramen burger in ny	exotic
then ate it for like a while week and gained so much weight so I stopped	LOL u liked it???? that sounds sooo strange tho
BRUH IT WAS DELCIIOSU ok it’s juicy meat with two buns of fried ramen SO GOOD	LOL isn't food in ny expensive as hell tho
nah some places def can be but there’s hella stuff to eat for cheap	i guess it depends on where u go
yeah but one time	dude what do you call all the rich houses overlooking central park
some of my friends are kinda rich for some reason so they like to make bets Brownstones? and I bet I wasn’t gonna get into gps so they made me pay	hmm idk i thought it was like a road name
for a 250 meal I cry	you should never bet against yourself you lose either way
oh wait	wdym some reason it's nyu
but they’re like abcs so I was surprised I did not befriend many fobs they’re too different	yo canadian abcs are rich as fuck tho
YES THATS THE GUY THAT I HOOKED UP WITH	oh that's cbc tho
4 MILLION DOLR APRTMENT	LOL
ok I did not know that And I learned About this entire culture	dude what was his name again
Of Asians from vancouver That are elitist af	vincent or some shit
And only hang out w each other Vincent was the guy I had a crush on	OH WHAT i thought canaidians were nice the fuck
Michael is his best friend who I hooked up with NOT THE CHINESE ONES	oh yeahhhh
they’re very pretentious but like one day I was studying a Michael and his friends came and they were like o wassup and then they found out I wasn’t from Canada And we’re insanely shocked I was like what the fuck	uhhh what
it’s a club	what's so great about being canadian
The Canadian club bc THEYRE all rich so they go do rich things	LOL
normal people cannot do	fuck the richhh not literally omg
like eat dinner w warren buffet	i mean i guess
Michael showed me this pic	u could
and I was like bruh u have too much money	holy shit are u for real
he literally ate dinner w warren buffet	holyyyyy
bc of like family connections and shit at that moment I realized Michael too powerful run away but alas knowing their group Did me harm And screwed me out of getting into this other finance club	what they do to u
^^	oh what how
it would’ve been better to apply without knowing them vincent is snake	was it the one vincent said he was giving u a first round interview
essentially yeah but he def lies he j said thst so I would get w Michael they kept giving me more rounds but knew they would never take me which is why I hated them like it was predetermined	that's so fucking snakey
I wouldn’t get in but they kept giving me bc this sounds bad but	how do u even deal with the bitches tffff
I like deserved it And people thought i would get in so they did it for appearnawa o wel life moves on but this one junior oh my bitch	:(( damn that sucks tho
she so snarky I avoid her like corona	haha don't tell me she got in
Oh she’s President now	oh rip
so I will never interact w he club again	LOL
their last president likes me but Vincent and his gang outnumber but the Canadians are dispersing there are less of them each year going extinct	oof i dislike clubs that help u get in cuz connections lol nice
That’s like everything in finance tho Which ig makes sense why the club system is like that Replicates the real life	sad
This is why if I had the facilities	gotta play into the system
I would hole up and code And never look back	LOL facilities
tiktok is So obsessing	dude we can work on something that involves coding this summer i've got time
jamie I have no facilities	can u renegad
of course I renegade so well I can teach renegade for	nobody in cs knows shit u learn it all on the job
renegading	LOL
I want to go back to hs and redo very differently but alas actually I go redo life I miss childhood	what would you have done differently
so carefree now LinkedIn gives me stress have more fun enjoy life	ugh same i actually was like stressed cuz of linkedin the other day
Most addictive social media site	lowkey tho i thought about that too i was like if i had enjoyed hs more would i still have gotten in like anjali and nisarg had a good time in hs
Very true Ig in the moment It was too hard to take the risk	i actively stay off that hellsite LOL
people from stern class of 2024 keep requesting me	yeah i always come back to this same conclusion as well
and it is pissing me off like calm yo pants u hardo	they tryna poach u already
omg on r/nyu someone posted a question asking about stern clubs and people in qfs just trolled them for days those incoming freshman were traumatized	damn ri pyour reddit
I was actually helpful and helped people figure out their schedule I’m reaching peak boredom	what a good samaritan we got paired up with prefrosh for cpw which is like campus preview they're called like mitpals
aw So cute That’s actually so cute lol	and my mitpal literally ghosts me for a month at a time and only emails me when she has 10 questions
I dislike	and then she doesn't even tank me until a month later
also wtf kinda questions she got	like
did u guys ever like call or just email	what should i study is it hard to study this what clubs are you in is it intense will i be overwhelmed where you live i offerred to call like twice because she keeps making me write these 5 paragraph email responses
HAHAHAHAH	but she never agreed
ghost her back	literally i thought about it but then i was like i will be the bigger person
was ur mentor person last year helpful	we didn't get a mentor person last year since campus preview was in person
someone at stern last year messaged people on LinkedIn asking for advice on clubs and stuff	but my host was basically my mentor
and then got blacklisted	holy shit really
yes very sad	why tho that seems reasonable
the thing is stern is all hardos pretending not to be hardo like u can’t show that you’re trying super hard	LOL ok i see
u gotta keep it lowkey and be like able it’s very stupid but anyway	u gotta teach me to navigate the system one day
hopefully u will never need to know honestly if u come to nyu I’ll show h the stern building and you’ll pick up the vibe immediately	haha life reaches a point for all of us where we need to know this unless you're a fucking academic god i could never
the fucking lobby has TVs that show the message iamstern everywhere OH MY ACTUAL GOAL is to be a professor	LOL
when I’m older I would enjoy	you can be rachel chu professor of economics
ok can my rich husband find me o wait there’s michel Michael but let’s not do that ok cai xukun	LOL yeah it's no fun if they're not from asia
HUH did u just reveal u like fobs	LOL i'm just agreeing with you for fun
yeah sure I figured u out	i'm pretty sure i don't like fobs
Fobs for ok like americanized fobs?	what the hell is an americanized fob LOL
like a fob who’s chill idk I think Chinese Canadians Are Americanized fobs	i like chill people in general oh that's fair
like that just makes sense I also appreicate the chilly weather	is nyu chilly
idk what this means But imma have to say no	is new york chilly lol mb
oh HAHAHAHA I thought u meant are the people chill yeah in winter otherwise pretty warm like I either wear hoodies or a Canada goose No in between	that sounds not warm
New York is in the north Use ur brain oh I mean for like outerwear in the fal and late spring don’t wear jackets really	damn you really did me like that huh
Work on ur excel It’ll help u Be smarter	ugh there's so many things i should learn this summer
ok so like that’s the mindset we had in hs right	i'm being serious we should actually do smth together
I’m learning to be chill	it'll be fun we can learn at the same time
okay I will commit to learning I repent relent	wait this time my learning is for my own personal growth
was it not always for growth	like 89% of it is so i can do cool things
ohh gotchu that’s good	before it was like 67% of was
I learn so as not to be fired interesting to experience smth new	yeah cuz you're always in a hurry in hs so there's no time to actually learn something well
wow hs sucked thinking back I literally have zero memories nothing was worth remembering lol	wow now that i thin kabout it we're having vastly different college experiences
how do so u are probably still very focused	u know all this shit idk and i know all this shit udk
this is true there is so much knowledge in the world wow	HAHA yes so much knowledge
but the question is do we really know the stuff we “know” I would beg to differ for myself	that's fair idk much about software programming is just an itty bit of it
what kinda classes did u take do u know about hardware	i'd say u know quite a bit
lol idk what the other categories of knowledge are for tech stuff	i LA'd this class last semester and even the second time around there was stuff i didn't know LMAO oh yeah i took an embedded systems class last semester too which is like half hardware half software
honestly at least u kept learning what is hardware like what can u learn about it do u learn how to build it	mostly it's like circuits and systems
omg that sounds terrifying	like e&m lol
it sounds like physics OMG yeah there’s reason I never took that traumatizing	we don't learn so much as how to build it as how to use it
Oh I remember Stawasz vividly	a lot of hardware tech already exists so putting it together is like the main point haha mechanics is a whole different ballgame
I cannot even imagine what a class in that would be like	it was really interesting but we had to write in C which is like what all umich kids use
do u guys have to take like bs classes too	it's just a disgusting language overall
like core requirements that r stupid	tbh not really
very lucky I had to take a class called business and society Worst times of my life	i mean yeah there are core requirements but it's like
Literally the most useless thing I have ever experienced	chemistry biology physics math
BRUH I have not experienced those since high school amazing crazy how like	did u learn about business and society
I’ll never take another math class literally no I learned how to speak very liberally	wait what there's no math requirement????
and appease the teacher it’s like calc bc replaces ur math	ohhhhh yeah i technically don't need more math either but it depends on if i switch majors to eecs instead of just cs i find chemistry to be really irrelevant to me tho so i'm putting that off until like junior year
that’s fair do chem majors just go do research	we're required to take like at least one humanities every semester tho
what counts as humanities	well if you're chemical engineering you're actually in high demand
that sounds very complicated Idk how to engineer chemicals	pharma and oil companies want u
yo working for pharmacy that’s amazing pharma too much money	anything that's not stem basically - arts, social sciences, humanities is the total encompassing thing so philosophy economics writing music linguistics
o I’d take like econ philosophy seems cool but also very hard like how can u get graded	political sicence too
in philosophy	philosophy kills students lol i had a discussion with anjalie one day about whether incest was morally wrong
my mom strangely wants me to study psychology imma have to say yes	my brain hurt so much afterwards
HAHAHAHAH	wait no think of the situation like this
no we are. It not doing this incest is bad	say a brother and sister have sex but nobody knows, there's no baby, and there's no psychological damage is it morally wrong
morally wrong doesn’t have to do with the consequences so even if nothing bad happened as a result it’s still wrong that’s yo family bad bad	but what makes it wrong right LOL
imma about to type into google	i won't get into it depper but essentially
why is incest wrong fbi about to pounce on me	LOL morality isn't defined by societal standards tho according to philosophy there may be some absolute rightness or wrongness of an action like in the good place
are you citing a tv show	yes lol the good place was actually so great it's the only american tv show i've actually watchdd
I thought it was boring and stopped lol but the plot twist is goo	NO ITS SO GOOD u have to finish it i think it talks about human morality and goodness in an amusing and creative way i have no tv to watch rn tho so i'm trying for like the tenth time to watch avatar
OH ME TOO I’m on season 2 but kinda bored now attack on titan good tho	i heard it gets better tho so honestly i'm just waiting for zuko's character development
Me too he gets hot	i'm only on lik episode 6 of the first book
When he cuts off the ponytail LOL oh bruh u gonna be waiting for a long time	LOL WHAT
have u not seen the memes of him being hot on subtle asian traits	oh yeah but since i started i've been actively avoiding avatar memes so i don't get any more spoilers
what is there to spoil you know how it will end it is a children’s show	wait no i legitimately know almost zero details hey now it's the journey that matters
ok I will stop talking people always say that But if I don’t find a show very interesting I’ll just search up the plot And not finish	oh for me i just stop
and I like spoilers the thrill of hearing information so great	lol that's interesting
I think it just means I’m impatient	also i think i'm out of my kdrama interests now
I only watch like crime thriller ones strangers from hell on Netflix	cuz i tried to start like 3 different shows a couple weeks ago
amazing very scary but very good	and all of them failed on me
what kind of kdramas do u like	like romcoms
bruh how are any of them every interesting The only good one was my love from another star	i don't like watching crime/thrillers tho
and even that had like mystery damn really Idt anything else is interesting besides like that and sci fi	dude that does not qualify as romcom
WHAT then wtf is a romcom	that's just straight romance
Give examples	like weightlifting fairy
wait that one seems so boring but it’s so hyped	i usually get bored by the time the romance rolls around
so idk if I will watch WAIT YEAH it’s interesting when they hate each other and then once they’re dating I give up	LOL really i watched that drama like 3 times when it came out
I tried to watch boys over flowers so many times	yeah same
but once her and Jun pyo started dating I just couldn’t	i can't stand it when they get all sappy with each other LOL Yeah I stopped xuz that got bad real fast Plus I realized how slow kdramas go Like I don't have the patience to watch a scene from 5 different angles anymore
OMFG HAHAHAHA	How the hell did I do that before
like intense music plays or those long chase scenes where the guy suddenly stops and does like a slow mo 360	I have this chrome extension that puts shit on 3x speed now My finger just automatically goes to that shortcut now
why’s everything get slow mod why’s it take them like 5 minutes to kiss	YEAH WHY DO THEY DO THAT I KNWO
they’re moving toward each other for so long and it takes like 10 episodes like damn	Yeah I also watch lecture on 3x now too
Did u watch crash landing WHAT	After I got back it was the only way I could keep myself focused
how can u even comprehend	No I was worried about it being too cringey
what ur prof is saying	Wait that's the fun part
wait it’s actually cute BRUH imagine learning about hardware On 3X speed	You have to figure it out and that's what keeps my attention My attention span is so short I need it If he even takes a second to breath my hand automatically moves to open fb on my phone LOL No even worse I learned algorithms on 3x
HAHAHAHAHA	That class actually made me concerned I was gonna tank
ok I now understand fully that u belong at mit who tf listens to lecture at 3X speed nobody	DUDE I HAVE A FRIEND THAY GOES 5X that's actually insane
I cannot even Imagine	You can't even recognize your profs real voice anymore after watching 3x for a while
ig u do talk kinda fast but 3X	Yeah U get used to it
No u don’t Most I do is 1.5x I’m a pleb	Wait yeah u can work up to kt Like I started from 2x And work up
wait all my lectures are like attendance mandatory	:ooo The fuck
So I can’t eve. Just watch recordings	So u zoom in
Participation baby! no like talking and stuff	So u just put a picture of your face as your background And then you're set
it is not this simple unless it is hmm	Yeah u can set zoom background and/or videos
Yes mine is currently Cai xukun	LOL omg You're so obsessed
Facts During youth with you Peak obsession HE Ws such A HOT PD LIKE BRO	Haha he was really good tho I'll admit He was very caring towards the trainees
he was so wise	Haha yeahhh
and now he’s a crackhead on keep running duality	LOL he just gets played by the older members Rip
He is what we call Sa	Also I keep forgetting Justin is so young Like Fool?
younger than us lmao yes bro Justin during the wedding episode Mans held up a peace sign	I know what the hell I'm not ready to be on television
HAHAHA	LOL Rip
why does cai xukun seem like he’s had hella girlfriends it is quite strange	Wdym it seems like that You know what Maybe Idk
WHAT NO	I can't tell u
DONT RUIN THE ILLUSION FOR ME	Spend more time observing him Ok I won't ruin it then
do u believe he has dated many people	But chivalry is trained
because he seems so like busy he’s been doing this idol stuff since like 2013	Oh What Did not know
I saw something thst said Cai Xukun is the modern Confucian man I laughed very hard	LOL wise beyond his years
I have also been told I am quite mature!!!	Ohooo Maybe in some contexts
Once my prof graded my research paper again after I told her I was a freshman And gave me a better grade lmaoo	Ayeee You exceeded expectations
have not seen that since middle school report cards dude nothing compares to the stress of report cards u literally have no idea what’s coming on then	Lol were u really that worried tho? You were a good student
I was worried about the beachior stuff I wasn’t a good student in middle school def like average but I talk a lot so I kept getting usually	You glowed up
HAHAHAHA I remember in tenth grade My mom was like Thank god u are not totally dumb I said xie xie	OMG WHAT HAHAHA I can't omg
I was indeed 21st percentile in nwea in 1st grade my mom threw me into kumin after kumon	Was she ever upset at u because of
I then progressed to 96 the following year!	School
My proudest achievement	Beautiful I could've done w some kumon tbh
yeah but she let up mid high school	My mental math is hella shit
That’s the only math I’m on at okay It helps with interviews tho A bunch of clubs ask mental math shit For some reason lol	YEAH I KNOW I always fail lol
it’s so stupid HAHAHAHAAH	Wait no joke It takes me soooo long
wait do they just ask like 17*29	To do a multiplication that's higher than 10 and 10
HAHAHAHAHA how long	No they ask they percentages
does it take OHHH I hate that	For like a consulting case
Ohh like market sizing	Oh well they did that on my interview for sbc Which I was woefully unprepared for
wait is sbc like investing or consulting how can a club be so broad	I was off by like 2 degrees for the population of the united states
how do y not know	SBC has like consulting finance and entrepreneurship
the population	But essentially it's finance Wait idk I'm just degenerate at common knowledge
35 350 million around IM DEAD what did u say	I'm actually degenerate So embarassing Like 5mil or some shit
HAHAHAHAHAHHA NO FUCKING WAY IM DEAD	It made the rest of the calculations hella easy thi
IM ACTUALLY DEAD THIS IS AMAZING	Dude I'm so shit at market sizing I gave up after thag
someone once asked me my thoughts on some company	I realised I could never recover
and then asked me what their last years revenue was and was off by like a lot but then I realized I could salvage By being like Oh I was talking in dollars The company reports in Swedish krona and they just didn’t check And believed me	Holy
life crazy	They were like Nice she did the conversion
HAHAHA ig honestly those questions are jsut for pressure And see how u react	Whatever tho I'm like
so if u come up w some reasoning is chill	Too lazy to practice market sizing anymore I should just focus on getting more common knowledge first
it’s so pointless like in what scenario will u only be able to size a market on the stop with no external research	Yeah most things are Like this Pointless
yeah club apps are tricky the process is stupid but honestly just don’t know what else they could do to make it more effective	Hmm yeah guess so I'm kind of at a loss for what else to try to join next year bc most orgs at mit are externally facjng
wdym externally facing	So members typically give more than they learn They run events for the public Or their community Or offer resources To the community
what are u in rn and are u gonna continue those	I'm in HackMIT
bc honestly I’d just stay w my current clubs then get a job or do research w a pod	Women business leaders
prof	And startlans Startlabs Women business leaders and start labs are both p shit Oh and club tennis But that's just for fun
damn how u got time U seem busy enough w that	Hack is the only real commitment I have The other two are fake
u could try sbc again? JOIN GPS	Eh they usually only recruit freshmen and rarely any sophomores
sophs can join too	Hmm maybe gps at mit usually takes directly from SBC tho Well not usually But SBC prepares u well for it
do people at mit work during school year	Like coffee shop jobs? I'm sure there are some like that but
no like internships	Oh
nyu soph yeah is like expected to	Co ops are p rare I think
year	Oh what the fuck How
but that might just be bc location	Does new York companies offer a lot of co ops
idk what a co op is	It'd have to be in person so that's jnderstandable Like school + work So like the work is aware that u have the school
oh nah it’s just like an internship like u would have int he’s unmet	And vice versa
oh wait yes like there isn’t some formal offering it’s just companies know u go to school so u work around that	Oh damn
I’m stacking my schedule next sem in case I do that but honestly I’m not tryna work 40 hours a week plus go to school	That's p intense
my friend worked 60 a week plus school idk how she’s alive	OK you guys go hard
it’s very unnecessary very stressful	I didn't even know companies recruited during the school year That's insane
Banking recruits sophomore spring essentially by this time next year I’d theoretically have my junior year internship And theoretically from that full time job	Wow big girl Its coming up
dude that’s so fucked LIKE HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO COMMIT TO THAT I. A YEAR IDK SHIT	Haha you're learning a lot from school and your clubs tho right
not much from school clubs yeah but it’s hard without formal training	What else r u doing besides qfs and gps
it’s just like guesswork and some common sense and asking questions lol	That's fair
those are two main things I honestly don’t have time for anything else oh some volunteering stuff but that’s just for fun	Sounds like qfs keeps u busy
true being fired is truly terrifying but I think they lowkey need diversity and don’t fire many girls lmao	Oh I thought u were using that jokingly is that actually a thing Being fired
oh yeah There’s a strike system 2 strikes then u get fired	LOL damn
or if they think u aren’t making progress or like aren’t as good as the others u get evaluated beginning of every sem	That means they actually care about u doing shit then
freshman summer is when most people get fired so rn is grind time kinda	Oh what r u like a trainee or smth
nah it’s just once ur a sophomore u rarely get fired	This is insane wow
but still possible idt most clubs are like this Just qfs but honestly qfs is the feeder for gps so maybe that’s why	But
yeet	It means they keep track of your progress Is qfs really large How many students r in it
well it’s kinda weird structure juniors lead the club and don’t do like grunt investing work and there’s three separate portfolios so in each portfolio 5 freshman and 5 soph analysts with a couple juniors as ur portfolio managers and then seniors just pop in from time and time to give feedback and help w whatever	Do u guys actually manage money then In your portfolios Oh yeah that makes sense
no for qfs it’s paper money just to like learn and test strategies gps managers I think like 500k	That's cool
yeah I like it but honestly could I do this for 50 years what a drag	LOL U could go hard for 10 years then retire I mean if it's the same process over and over again I think I'd get bored too Recently I realized I hate applying the same skills over and over
yeah u have ti like actually love investing	Even if it's to slightly different tasks Yeah idk man
plus u just get judged on ur returns so like if u don’t make money u get fired a toxic culture stay coding	The fuck Wait if it's paper money does that mean they're just pretending to invest it And seeing the actual outcome and making a prediction on whether you'd get returns U can do it!
yeah we trade it on think or swim bob the builder We can do it!	Oh huh I just looked it up That seems interesting But you're not actually trading it on there you're using its data points as benchmarks rifht That's really toxic tho U don't get to make mistakes
jaMiE WE CANT GET TO THE SECOND PAGE HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAA HAHAHAHAHAHAHA ok sorry how's novi?	omfg you guys are having the time of your life it's good i went shopping with my mom  here's a tutorial u can read the one page on routing but the whole thing looks pretty good for flask  The essential chapters: Chap 1-5, 15, 23 resources from my hack team i would use app route to render the new question.html page btw u can debug how to pass in parameters for dictOfSongs but it's cleaner that way i think alright i'm going to bed good luck
I DID IT JAMIE	LOL CONGRATS
Wtf go to bed	Just on my phone in bed About to seriously
heyyy I think it should be stud	Oh awesome thankssss Just ground floor?

Hey Jamie! Hope you’re doing well at school! I just had my first tutoring session with Andrew and was wondering if you had any teaching tips or insight into if he needs breaks in between problems or if he learns better a certain way? Idk I just want to teach him the way he’s used to learning	"Hey yeah so idk how much Andrews mom told u but he has a harder time communicating and understanding than ethan I think u can get through 1 or 2 sections with him every week Ask him leading questions I typically have both of them do examples on the page without looking at the answer And we step through the process together Give him time to do the problems he really likes keeping his paper neat so don't write on it with pen unless you're grading homework I assign homework after I finish a section (do odds because the answers are in the back) At the beginning of class I check homework then go over wrong ones Sometimes if the section is tough I do give him a break I was able to cut most of them out by the end of the summer but try to keep him engaged They both like to look at their phones or get distracted by books sometimes so just gently remind them or say something like ""Andrew let's finish this section and I'll give u a three minute break"" or ""you can look at your phone after class Andrew but let's get through this section first"" I think he feels more comfortable if he's OK being honest w u like start small and ask him about his day or what's going in in his life just some chill stuff Yeah I realized I didn't prep you super awesomely so please keep texting me if u have any other questions"
oooh hmmm Maybe speech? I think that’s what I did	ok that's what i was thinking as well what'd u talk about ok i wrote the speech u want to review it for me?
Sure!! Sorry omg I didn’t see the earlier notifs	its alright i just wrote it kind of my style
I made mine super brief idt I still have it but just a thank u to Lowe’s and some cheesy stuff about team lmao Good I like ur style haha	"Hi everyone! For those of you who may not know me yet, my name is and I’m one of this year’s captains. I’ve got a little end-of-the-year sort of speech to give, but before I begin, I’d like to let everybody know what our seniors’ plans are for the future and give them a quick shout-out. 

Morgan Besant is headed to MSU this fall to study molecular genetics.
Raveena Joshi will be going to Virginia Commonwealth University on a Direct Med track.
You will see Anjali Singh at Cambridge at MIT, where she intends to study computer science.
Catherine Xu, my fellow captain, is headed towards MSU to study MAJOR.
And I will be joining Anjali at MIT this fall as well, where I’ll be studying computer science and business. 

This year marks the end of my fourth season on the Novi Girls Varsity Tennis team. In these four years I have played the most tennis of my life, and I have also been the most tan I have ever been in my life too. I am often on the receiving end of Lowes’ roasts because I am, indeed, a loser, but in many other ways being a part of this team makes me feel like a winner. 

Before high school, I had never really played on a sports team before. The entire feeling of really getting to know other tennis players and supporting other people in general at matches and tournaments was kind of foreign to me. Admittedly, I was a lot more quiet back then too, which I’m sure Lowes enjoyed a lot, but as I’m sure everyone on this team has discovered by now, that didn’t last long. Also, I realized that you actually had to use your brain on the tennis court, so that was a real shocker too. Perhaps I had grown up with this idea that maybe if you hit the ball hard enough over the net, it wouldn’t come back. And apparently that’s not how points are won when you play real tennis. So I got maybe a few points added to my tennis IQ, but more importantly I learned how to compete. 

As it turns out, I am not as athletic as I may seem. Every year we play a few quads on weekends, right? In my freshman year, at my first Saturday with the team, I played a 5-7 first set at Greenhills for the Ann Arbor Huron quad. And then I was out after that. I’m pretty sure I lost every single set after that because physically I was not prepared for three matches in a day, and mentally I was exhausted from a single set. I cannot tell you how many times I have had a mental breakdown before, during, or after a match in the past four years. I’ve cried, unfortunately, a lot more than I’d like to have cried. I realized, also, that over the past four years I have unknowingly grown to love this sport and this team so much. 

This may be the last time we are together in a long, long time. We’ve made some incredible memories this year, and I hope that, like me, your love for tennis has grown a little bit more too. To my seniors, I wish you all the best in your future adventures. Regardless of whether you’ll continue to play competitively in college, I hope you can still appreciate tennis in some way or another in the coming years. To the rest of you guys, you will have to see Lowes in school and on the tennis courts for at least another year, hopefully. I only have two requests for you: 1. Don’t forget about Fu. I expect weekly donations to the Jimmyfood Foundation and you can also just send me money. 2. This is the more important one. I’ve realized that you learn a lot more from playing on this team than just tennis technique or strategy. You learn hard work and team work, you learn perseverance, you learn what it means to push yourself and reach for your goals. And tennis is a sport where you never stop learning. So whether you have one season left on the team or another three to go, my only wish is that you never stop learning. Because when you feel like you know it all, that’s when the fun of tennis really disappears. 

So, with that being said, I will now conclude this speech and show you guys how fun Catherine and I really are through our paper plate awards. mine is almost 5 minutes"
dude no I like it Please don’t change it I’m tearing up LMAO	omfg thanks you're so sweet
lol genuinely it’s really well written Please send me a video hehe and it really does sum up the whole tennis experience And this is crazy lol but I feel like I remember that match ur talking about Was it when Lowes made u eat some Clift bars	omg ok OMG yes it was OMFG
Bc I remember I had to dig thru my bag And I gave u peanut butter	lmaooooo damn we're on the same wavelength
And then I was like FUCK IS SHE ALLERGIC Man	lollllll
I do miss HS tennis haha Seriously wish I had kept up with tennis hnghhhhh	yeah even tho there was some complicated stuff going on this year its like when am i gonna get this opportunity to do this again so
you really don’t	yeah
And yeah my senior year wasn’t ideal either	gotta appreciate it while it lasts yeah ikr
But yes!!	FRESHMAN YEAR PEAK
Appreciate everything when you still can HAHA my sophomore year I peaked	agree
Was seeded And then I died	LMAOOO
BUT ITS FINE	6th place at states boiiiii oh wait no that was my sophomore year
WE WERE LIKE HELL YEAH BOIS HERE WE COME and then we didn’t	but freshman year was like still great
Freshman year was great bc the team was solid	yeha
Like friendship wise haha	no BEEF
BEEF!? IDK HER	LMAOO
U shud def find a hitting partner thoooo Maybe Just occasionally at MIT	yeah i really hope i can
I’m sure u can :)) Ur #1 singles hello 3 years in the running	i'm ass at tennis hello
UR LITERALLY NOT	1 singles in massachusetts is a different level from 1 singles in michigan
Ehh it’s fine	but surprisingly apparently michigan breeds good top level tennis players
SEE DAS U	i'm not at that level tho i'm talking like anika and tia and denali
But seriously it’d also be for like recreational And meeting new ppl so I mean it doesn’t have to be red	yeah playing tennis is fun
*rec But like it’s not gonna b a high pressure thing anymor	right
Unless u want it to be BASICALLY what I’m tryna say is tennis is whatever u want it to be like Andrew literally just hits randomly with friends	LMAO yeah that's what he told me as well
man ur speech inspired me I might hit sometime Soon	when he finishes his dumb class i'm finna drag him out to hit
Prob need to restring my rackets tho	ayeee
DUDE CAN I COME	duh
ILL PRACTICE BEFORE ok but real talk	LMAOO
I haven’t used my rackets in a year Do u think I should restring	tension should still be alright tho hopefully
Bc like I feel like I don’t play consistently enough	they can't really get looser by that much can they?
To pay for restringing yet I hope not... Should I text Brady	brady done quit bro
Be like “YO U DONT COACH ANYMORE but tennis strings”	oh
I gots to know	i was like u didn't know??? LMAOOO
nah I’m an expcetion He’d come out of retirement just for me duh	oh right ofc my brother and i technically take lessons from justin now well not me but my brother
damnnn Justin got businesss booming now No completion *competition How is he as a coach?	yeah i mean he's a good coach but my mom says sometimes he's kind of lazy he's young tho but my parents watch lessons so it kind of keeps him in check
yeah same no offense did get that vibe from him lol Just a little when I was next to his court And Brady would b coaching me	he teaches me better technique tho
That’s good!!	well he taught me
He never really got anywhere with jordana’s backhand hahaha	my forehand was only like halfway there when season started does jordana even take lessons from him anymore no i don't think so
Nah but when she did	yeah lmao she's stubborn tho
Like he just kept training her forehand	damn should i go visit tammy sometime
Which is like solid but yo omfg Tammy I appreciate her a lot haha It’s been a hot minute	i really do
But damn	she was so like
She really whipped me into shape	intense yeah half of my mental tennis mindset is from her man like idk what to say
It sounds terrible lol but she was the first coach who was like you can beat people like michelle Same	lmao DAMN go off
NO NOT LIKE BEEF	but fr tho self esteem strategy let's get this bread
but everyone was always like yo pace is where it’s at And so I felt like shit lmaooo	lmao FAKE NEWS
And I kept trying to add more pace	i need toPSpiN tho
And she was like ur puny arms aren’t going anywhere with the back *ball I HAVE TOO MUCH LETS COLLAB	ugh i need more
Or I did	donate time travel donate
I don’t have anything anymore HAHA Bet	lmaooooo big money moves only
Man imagine if we had been trained has doubles our whole lives	wild
I actually just enjoy singles strategy more lmaooo	yeah me too because when you're not good at the net or u don't train it a lot it's just not enjoyable
R FUCKIN T	to watch ball after ball fly past u
and it’s a lot of reaction	yeah
Like singles I have more time to think while I recover	i like hitting with the boys a lot more regardless tho
Doubles I’m just tryna not get hit in the face	but i aint' got nobody to hit with LMAO
ANDELU LEGGO actually I’m gonna start hitting This is it	LMAO alright u got this katie
gotta lift too tho UGH	ugrh i don't like working out
Tryna diet + hit is not good Same So that’s why I was gonna die Diet Not die	diet is fake news no diet you're fine
But like I know that’s not gonna help with my tennis lmao Which is why I never did during HS SKSKSK UGH Tennis I miss it	haha
If u couldn’t tell	life only moves forward tho just make the best of it ig
that’s true!	gotta figure it out at some point me i mean
change is inevitable lol but that’s oki	that's sad but true
Or at least that’s what I’m trying to learn how to be okay with it Not necessarily a bad thing!	have u listened to the bts x charli xcx collab yet

Gotta secure that job first	u got this
$$$ money moves	lollll no job aint' got non ove here
no no for like out of college lol	oh
Can’t do recruiting with pink hair	yah agree but
besides it’s ur summer before college Enjoy	you're not gonna be pink haired forever just
Is the motto	like a year maybe
But also like recruiting for sophomore year internship!	oh wewh eh ehhhh
Basically until I get my secure job offer I am not touching my hair or getting tattoos And then I’ll show up and be like SURPRISE BITCH	hahah ok ok i see u
Yeaaah Hbu? Are u retouching hair? How short is it now btw? When it’s down?	nope my recent haircut got rid of the last vestiges of my highlights from freshman year and it's about at my shoulders a little lower now
Freshman year!? ooh okay	they cut off a lot he*
It def looked shorter up haha	oh yeah probably over half a foot they cut off
But i feel like u look good with short hair too so DAMN I’m tryna grow mine out rn did u donate?	no actually it was like a last minute appt don't really know how to anyways but i should think about doing that next time didnt even cross my mind yeah i wasn't sure if i was going to like it short but its very convenient and light now and i feel like that's what matters more to me
Actually tho It’s why I always end up chopping mine Shoulder length But I was like duck this rly ain’t a look	LMAO
So ya know now we’re back to medium length	no but you start to realize your hair is actually quite heavy
It rly is	my neck feels so free these days
I think I lose 1 lb lmao Every time I chop	LOLLL easy weight loss plan right there no dieting necessary
Like deadass before and after on the scale HAHA GO BALD ur right	eassyyyyy
Damn an intellectual	so theoretically u could stop dieting rn and just go get a haircut
I haven’t started dw Nah dude the thing is for the hair dye part	smh don't do it
They charge the same p much regardless of length	ohhhh ha i gotchu
Better for me to keep hair long and get the bang for my buck	bang for your buck OMG we said the same thing
GIRL	like i said

Good night buddy!	ofcofc gngn Happy birthday katieeee
thanks hamieeee let’s catch up soon when ur back :’)	Yusss
hiyaaa I just wanted to say this was rly well written & def addressed a lot of the issues I’ve felt with the whole overly condemning nature I’ve seen shared by some ppl on social media & like u said how that can honestly deter real edu from happening bc ppl are too afraid to even speak up or ask questions to learn for fear of being condemned of being ignorant	omg thank you so much for sending me this  i was also really scared of like 1. posting it and 2. being more active in general cuz lilke i'm scared of being wrong too or like saying smth wrong
I feel u but I was talking with Maithelee about this and like we need more ppl speaking up in the manner u did Just being real & acknowledging learning is a process Also I feel like a lot of ppl feel similarly so by u posting stuff like this it gets the convo going !!!	thanks bb that's what i was hoping for <33
plus ur well spoken hamie give urself more credit 	AHHHH no i'm always agonizing over what to write takes a long time working on this summer to write more too
ooh are u gonna keep updating ur blog I liked ur first entry	ahah yeah there's like two other entries but they weren't very good so i didn't pub them
Ooh what were those on? also writing or blogging is just a nice way to organize thoughts/reflect Even if it’s unpublished :PP	haha one of them was on self-isolation adventures and the other one is about a book i read called the three body problem
ooh what’s the book about? lmao wait I wanna hear these self isolation adventures	it's a chinese sci-fi novel about aliens, physics, and culture to put it shortly but that's not a very accurate description it's very good it takes on sci-fi in a really artful and novelistic way ah you'll have to read my article then ;))
Wait that sounds so interesting do we have the cultural outfits and setting too Cuz I’m hoe for that  BET I’ll be the first reader on the page when it drops	Lol it's modern day Oh it's already there lol
wait what Gotta go read asdfghjkl	LOL Appreciate your support
woah ok ngl I think 3 body problem is slightly flying over my head with my hs honors physics background but also damn u learned how to play guitar during self isolation ??	LOL i don't understand it really well but it's a really intersting problem that also means my explanation of it wasn't sufficient rip i started learning i'm pretty shit still but i'm getting better
Are u self teaching? Cuz my mom bought a guitar years ago and now it’s just chilling there collecting dust *self learning wtf lmao when I forget how to English Nono like all I remember about physics is langley making us calculate a bear’s walking speed vs velocity I’m p sure it’s me 	uh it's a guitar from my old like preschool and shit and i finally pulled it out oh shit LOL
woah what what size is the guitar then?	i thought it was a 3/4 but i measured it the other day and it might actually be a full size
damn wait I can’t believe you bought it when u were in preschool LOL My hands 100% would’ve been too small to even hold it	LOL I never used it My mom bought it and saved it for me
she had the long term picture in mind my mom was like pick either the piano or the cello	I bet she regrets it now every time I pick it up
LMAO my mom everytime I try to learn a bts song on the piano	LOL
HIHI WHEN ARE U FREE we should FaceTime and properly catch up hehe	i'm so down i don't have ft tho
smH AnDrOiD Jk jk Messenger or zoom works too!	Lolll My dad actually recently got an ipad
woahhh this is how it all starts But yeah just let me know when u is free	Yeah ik Hope we don't get spoiled by ot Sure sure
What days are u usually free I wanna get an iPad Pro but they’re so $$	haha ikr my dad didn't get the pro he got idek the name but he got it while it was on sale most weekdays between 5-7 and basically most evenings not mon-tue
Ooh	Yahhh
And same lol so Wednesday or Thursday ? Wait except I don’t get off work till like 7 🤡 are u free any other time LMAO	but why i'm down yeah like all lthe time during the day
LOL big rip I’m like not free 10 am to 7 pm are ur weekends packed	no not really lol i just leave them cuz my parents make me spend time w them and/or i'm sleeping
Say hi to your new Facebook friend, Krittamate.	hey boom i'm an LA for 004 and i have a scheduled checkoff lab hour at 11 is there a specific set of questions i should be asking / answers i should be looking for
oww right now you can still continue helping people like usual. We will go over the discussion question in the meeting, but the checkoff will not start until the lab is due (which is Friday). Just make sure that if someone wants a checkoff, tell him/her that checkoff start this Friday.	oh ok got it thanks boom
can i join assassin	Yes
wonderful ty is there a slack channel or anything	Nope will dm assignments soon your assassins target is soomin - check go/assassins for the rules, starts tonight at 12am
WOW exciting	hehe
oh yeah i told anjali we would be having a meeting at 5pm today if u want to stop by we can also send that if ur not free	yeah that'd be great ik u guys will be discussing a lot of things at the meeting so i wouldn't know when to pop in
okay sure!	yeah let me know how it goes
hey! okay so what do we need to do should we start tomorrow with a couple of like what we wish we knew before moving to maseeh-type things i feel like if i was a prefrosh i would be scared to ask questions lol	oooh yeah if some prefrosh don't have questions we can also come up with a list of questions we can ask too there's not like an insane number of participants so we can probably just alternate finding questions and asking the panelists
yeah	i could also keep a doc open and write down answers as panelists answer, sort of like meeting notes so latecomers can see them too
oh yeah that would be good	ok great i just started a q&a doc in the shared folder i gotta head out soon i've got lab at 9:30am tmrw but i threw in a couple of questions in the doc  here's the direct link!
Yes and no Lol maybe played like twice in my life?	Oh man Well There's an iasa tourney On July 20th
Lmao yeah idk about tournaments	And I'm tryna find a team It's just for fun but there's a cash prize if u win If you wanna join No one is opposed Or u can come and support too Whatever u want
Hmm when is it	It'll be fun July 20th sat 9am Ik that's an early time
Yeah damn lol	For u college hoes
When is the sign up deadline	Tbh no idea I can remind u later or smth
Yeah I’m probably ass so idk about playing but I might come watch I got nothing better to do anyways And get my free meal u promise lol	Lmao oh shoot I did promise that OK sure I've honestly been freeloading off dongha a lot for food So I feel like I should pay it forward Yeah come wwtch Joe's on our team
Whao Dongha buys u food?	Lmao not that much He always hassles me about the money I owe him too Honestly the amount of driving places I do for him He should just cancel my debt But nooo Sometimes tho if the bill comes when we go out to eat w friends I just hand it to him and he grumbles and pays it Then makes me pay him back later
Damnnnn he must like u A LOT	Ha good one He calls me a fucking dumbass all the time
He never paid for his food with me	Like The words
I just bought him food	"""fucking dumbaas"""
Mhhmmm~~~	Yeah no I just bully him into paying
Alright ma’am~	I'm going to China Saturday be back on the 8th so just text me to make plans w u I'm free Saturdays mostly and every other sundah

lol im actually only free on saturdays busy as fuck	Boi wtf Doing what man
Working full time plus tutoring	Oh shoot where do u work
Pdi It’s a distribution company	Oh wait we talked about this Bro Stop being Busy
I wish After work I have tutor everyday	Fude Dude Just Stop

lol if you can't go to google idk if anyone can	Smh I don't know shit man I'm supposed to learn this summer
pshhhh just enjoy your summer you'll do plenty of learning for the rest of your life	I'm going to China tmrw for like A week
thats like nothing.. you should go for like a month lol	Chinese Google ban I couldn't survive I have a vpn But that's just a pain to connect to every time
oh yeah lol sam's in china too he just always has it on	Jes probably not in the same part of china
Ur just going for a vacation right?	To visit my grandparents Hi happy birthday Just saw on fb
yeah I did what’s up	Do i miss anything groundbreaking Or any assignments
there's a paper we need to write on weed or something LOL he just went over that for like 2 seconds and then lectured about like more perception stuff for a while and talked about a guy who mistook his wife for a hat	beautiful lmfaooo that book we have to read right
lol interesting okay wait if i dont have a bp eos thing can I still get one from the office or somewhere?	oh sad uhhh yeah they're all in the office run michelle run
yo jamie what phone # do i use ^to refer you to the tutoring kids! they want you to tutor them!! 	Ayeeee 2489469089
awesome! expect a text soon(:	Yayyyyy The boys have their own material to study from right Do u teach any of your kids ela She wants me to recommend a good ela book Also what's the moms name
yea they learn from the standard math textbooks andrew algebra 1 and ethan was learning geometry i don’t teach ela yea she asked me that too bc she wants them to read hs level books no idea what her name is LOL and i’ve been tutoring them for a year	Omfggg Yeah I need to find a ela Textbook If they want to read hs level books That's easy I can get them started w that
andrew is hard to motivate to study and will gravitate towards being on his phone or reading a book so you gotta be firm but also give him a 3 minute break occasionally and he’ll get right back to it	Okay thank u michelle When I tutor them in math Do I teach them sections or do they come w homework done and I help them w problems
you teach them in sections so what i do is i’m usually able to get in 3 sections within the hour it’s teach, assign hw, let them work on it, check and repeat all over again ^2-3 sections	Oh shoot alright
and i always assign one section hw for them to do at home do they come the next session with hw ready and you check	At the next session? During the hour?
ethan was originally going to test out of geometry but he didn’t understand how proofs worked so if you do geometry with him, i’d just review all the theorems but not necessarily assign hw bc we already went through it and he just needs a refresher ^at the next session, they come with hw you assigned done and then you’ll grade it in the beginning of the session and go over corrections	Got itttt His mom told me he's studying algebra 2 now
yea so we kinda gave up on geometry and i’ve been teaching him algebra 2 you could do either	Lmaoo Yeah I think he's going for algebra 2 Much better for me actually since I never actually learned geometry  There's a link for 20% magnetic eyelashes in the description They look p good
OMFG LOL thnx jamie?	You're welcome Lmfao
hey my family is having a 4th of july  party this saturday at 5 PM we might go swimming, play volleyball and just chill at my house; and of course food!!! just bring yourself; lmk if you can come nvm i forgot you’re in china	Ooof damn I really wanna go Wait so I owe u 11 right
yes!	Okay yeah so I just realized I have nothing in my venmo rn so I need to break some bills and get someone to transfer me some But this will happen I assure u
no worries! i’ll remind you(: bc a girl broke but love you!	Lol thanks for the reminder I got money now missed your video chat. MB meant to call my mom Happy birthday michellee Forgot to text u earlier
"yeah I was actually just going to take a look at that the ""quite strange"" refers to the fact that 256 has less delay than 64"	yeah i remember that from our la meeting but some kid was like it should grow log n and i was like i have no clue dude
lol I'll take a look at the code	lmao thenk
okay so I took another look at it -- the point of dq1 and dq2 is to look at how MS handles the fanout optimizations specifically, for a mux, we actually don't expect any significant increase in the delay as we scale up because a mux that is switching between 2 n-bit inputs is literally just implemented as n 2-way muxes so theoretically, everything happens and parallel and there is no increase in delay the problem is that the sel signal needs to drive each of these 2-way muxes so if you end up switching between 2 64-bit signals, your sel signal has a fanout of 64 we can fix this by adding additional buffers/inverters in a tree structure but this adds area By adding the delay optimization in DQ2, we make MS optimize the critical path, adding gates as it needs to in order to reduce fanout	Wait sorry wdym by switching
oh so a mux chooses between two inputs sometimes we call this switching	Ohhh ok yeah
So I guess after all that, the answer to your question kind of depends on whether or not the student is trying to take into account the delay due to high fanout In general, this is kind of complicated since you want to reduce fanout by adding layers of buffers until the propagation delay of the buffers starts to take over If you ignore propagation delays, then probably approximately log(n) is about right I would think since you are adding log(n) layers of buffers to reduce the fanout	ah so how does adding the inv and buf gates reduce fanout or like hwat sort of operation is it doing to reduce fanout
so if a single gate is driving 64 wires going into other gates, we would say it has a fanout of 64. If, instead, I use my first gate to drive 4 buffers, each of which drives another 4 buffers, each of which drives another 4 buffers, I still end up driving 64 wires, but each device only has a fanout of 4 basically I'm using more buffers to amplify my current-driving capability	ohhhh ok yeah i see thanks miless
no problem!	hey miles i'm not gonna be able to make the lab meeting today r we just going over the discussion questions for lab 6? also do u still do thursday meetings? I might be able to make that one
yeah it's mostly just the lab 6 dqs. I'm still doing the Thursday meetings, so if you can make that one, that'd be great. I'll also be sending out an email with the relevant points probably tomorrow	ohhh ok that's great thanks miles for some reason your meeting room id is being provided as mine i think it's because i took some people off the queue before setting myself as active
oh wait what	u just took hillary off right
yeah	can u just text me your meeting room id he keeps getting redirected to mine i'm not sure why this is happening lmao
mit.zoom.us/my/milesdai hmm strange concurrency issues	miles are vectors one indexed or 0 indexed
should be 0 indexed	i have elena boal here and she's done it stage by stage and her pipelining is all done correctly but she's doing a sorting step incorrectly and i legit just can't figure out why do u mind taking a look if i put her back on the queue i don't want her to wait too long tho since i already spent like half an hour trying to find her error eek
lol do you want to trade? I've got Veronica Muriga	yeah sure lol thanks miles i'll put her back on now
Veronica basically is just having issues propagating the valid values	also when u find her error please tell me what it was so i can be royally frustrated at myself yeah i think i was helping her earlier veronica i mean hey miles i just rechecked didit and i'm not passing the beveren tests because of some error: FAILED - A Ld instruction caused the cache to return valid data for multiple cycles in a row. Check to make sure you are not putting your output into a register, and that you are only returning valid data under the appropriate conditions. so i'm trying to run the test locally to see if there's more logging but now makeDirectMappedBeveren produces a simulation executable do u know how i run those again oh rip i'm just seeing the messages in the slack riperoni i'm not supposed to be results into a reg? f ok i'm confused but i'll check it out
oh oops, sorry I'm on the queue atm; I can take a quick look at it later if it's not resolved	yee np lol i think ik what the issue is will let u know if i can't resolve lmao aight i figured it out hey miles i have someone with me rn with a really strange error it's saying her reqEnabled method isn't implemented properly so it's not even getting past the first cycle but it's like one line of code
can I take a look?	yeah do u want to just trade or should i send the section
is it on github?	method Bool reqEnabled = (state==Ready); that's like the one line yeah it's on github too
yeah looks correct to me lol -- it's probably something else	do u want to takeher off the queue or trade
I'll take her off the queue	ok thanks miles
So she was basically getting stuck in the Lookup state. It was in the if-statements there. Basically, if you know that there's not a cache hit, then you don't need to test the tags after that in the other if-statements. Her conditionals were too strict, and she had no else statement, which means that she was falling through all the conditionals in her lookup state and never changing state	oh f i see we tried doing a display from state == Ready tho and we weren't seeing anything in the output so i thought it wasn't able to enter at all
oh interesting - it might be possible to just put the printout at the top of the rule to always print the state. yeah I'm not quite sure why it would never print	hmm ok yeah cuz it was getting stuck on the first cycle but not returning the correct output either so does that mean like her conditional in the data method was wrong too
apparently not -- she passed all the test cases with those changes I'd have to take a closer look at the code	ok yah no worries i was just curious lol :PP gotta leave it to miles to find the bugs this is like the third time T.T
?	-anjalie dwai  Is your kerb iamroot Fr
Nah that's just one of my aliases I own iamroot@mit.edu but my kerb is cress But thank you finally someone gets my masterful reference :)	Omg milo what r u gonna do for dinner milo
Prolly Soylent :)	Lmso Ok
Why do you ask?	I want to go eat Asian food :pp but I don't want to go alone
Oh sure I'll go with you Where we headed?	lol milo u don't have to

Oh battlecode seemed interesting they just talked about how u can compete during iap or be a dev which can be non-technical organizing or technical coding stuff How was the machine thing? I heard it was very uninteresting!	Hi okay that's cool so it doesn't start until January right Uhhh yeah it was just machine intelligence outreach and not a super big organization so Idk the value of joining
If ur competing it's just iap if ur gonna be a dev there'll be like weekly meetings	Wait what do devs do again But I see
Design and implement the game, organize event get sponsors etc	Ohhhh wait OK I see Are u going to do it
Ye I'll probably be a dev If not I'll prob compete	Does being a dev require extensive cs knowledge
Heya! Is Jianna alright? Lmk if you need any help making sure she's ok	Um Not really I think she might be outside the room w Claire rn I just got a really bad stomachache and can't really move rn
Yikes, ok	Idk if u can help in any way But
I thought they were in the room	She might be outside by the elevator
I'll go take a look	I hope she didn't go down
Is Claire totally gone?	She's w claire No Claire's mostly fine Thanks robert
She’s done Indian dance for like most of her life, right?	She's certified to teach Indian dance ( I forgot what it's called) and she's in an organization for Indian dance on campus too Yeah
Oh wait that’s even better	This summer she made above minimum wage working at the same company her mom works at lol
LOL	She's worried about her thin and poofy hair but it's really not bad at all She slow danced with dongha paek at prom to perfect by Ed sheeran
Lol very specific there	You're welcome lol She really likes chocolate I think kit Kat's and Hershey are her favorite She sometimes will eat stuff with nuts in it even though she's allergoc
These are great -can differentiate members of a Korean boy band by face	Lol yes
Can I put this down	She can
I forgot to mention tk you I looked into it They want you to apply 3 weeks before your event And since this was last week when I looked in, it was after that Unfortunately :(( U got a different one?	I wonder if u can apply for tech treks instead
I'll look into it	ok thanks ruben
Hey I can't go to meeting today, there's an event I have been waiting for today Sorry for late notice	Got it can u let me know how Baker foundation is going
I'ma try to submit before this next week	I also assigned anjali to this today too can u focus on the vc/startup thing and help her on the side with this We're also going to apply for entrepralooza instead
Oh okay that works	going to idea factory on sat right?

Yup!	ok great do u have any specific updates for me rn

ben..?	ben gao he was the guy sitting next to me the other day
okay i'll ask him ty! did you take notes during rec? If so do you think you could send pics? ^006 with alex chen	ye i did i don't have it on me but alex just told me that he can send u pics of the board if u want
Hey! No one else put wanting to meet in the mornings would you prefer to meet early evening or late at night?	LOL f how late is late at night if there's any afternoon option too i'd take that
Hey how much budget do you think we have for swag for StartLabs	kind of negative but what's the plan we're trying to make 5k-9k still for spring break still
I thought tech trek was all paid for now? Also I think we can add some debt rn and pay it off later  cuz I think it would be nice to have swag for tech trek	well apparently sao is very mad at us so idk if we can
Oo ok	wait ik brendan and caleb still want swag tho
Sounds good! Thank you thank you	:DD text me/jack if you have any contested kills, but otherwise if you kill someone just have them pass on their target to you

Okay thanks for letting me know You can now call each other and see information like Active Status and when you've read messages.	yep np Hi how's hack stuff coming along just wanted to do a quick check in
pretty good i think at least for the circumstances	Lol yeah have your heads assigned tasks yet Or do u have a good idea of what you need to do
uh we haven't really assigned tasks yet cause things are still kind of in the air but for marketing at least, once we decide on themes, I'm assuming there will be a lot of work to do on assets n stuff	Okay yeah that makes sense But yeah we'll be starting to get into it more if not already so if u ever have questions or confusion lmk Yeah hopefully you're getting to know some committee members too!
Thanks for checking in!	yeah no problem also we're at go/zoom rn if u can join a ton of alum r here

Hi This is James Wu	uh hey james

makes sense sid's a pretty cool dood	lol ok thank u
is waving at you! HELLO HAHA	LMAO DOPEE
HOW HAVE YOU BEEN	DYING SCHOOL IS DEAD
oof mood	Big mood
how do you know konwoo's friend? the guy video calling hehe	Lol Ben lives in the quad across the hall
ah okay makes sense	Yeah he went to ssp with one of my roommates
o damn everyone has connections wait how many roommates do you have?	3!!!! Quad life
o boiii oh wait yeah quad smh	In the size of your living room Less than
yes maAM	BOO
we got that TRIPLE APARTMENT	Life sucks Fuck this shit
oof mOOd psets will kill me	Always Literally always
are you studying cs? i feel like most ppl from garcia/simons are lol	Yeah I'm a cs selloyt
YEET join the club	Lol nah I was always a cs prospective I did cs work over simons
oh wait i didn't know that lol i think my entire garcia research group is majoring in cs :)	Lol yeah but basically all others not cs defaulted to ca too Cs
yeye	Also yeah anjali said cs as well
yup not surprised lol how are your psets? i have never done proofs before and i'm getting my ass kicked and my first midterm is tmrw :') so we shall see how it goes	Same discrete is kicking my ass Oh shiit good luck
thanks heh	I don't have a quiz until next week
ooh good luck in advance every college does a lecture/recitation model right	i think so? not sure i learn everything from recitation ngl
wait really our lectures are fun but tangential and our recitations cover basic foundational knowledge i learn everything from psets lmao i think it'll change after the first midterm tho cuz they want to get everyone on the same page in terms of proof-solving ability first	oh what wait my psets are so like hard
no same i mean like	like
"lectures say stuff like ""oh here's what a biimplication is"" and recitations are like ""here's a truth table"" and psets say"	lol okay wait recitations review lecture basically for me
"""here's a formula good luck lmao"""	oh shit wait kind of same i feel like they're so unrelated
nice to see our suffering is the same everywhere	but since theyre case by case i feel like bleh it really be like that
it really do	://
yeah recitations are just mini lectures are your ta's undergrads? cmu has undergrad ta's but idk if that's the case elsewhere mini lecture reviews*	for discrete they are some of them at least but for others they aren't i believe
ah okie	yeah idk it kind of reduces my experience since they aren't that good at explaining it yet still nb tho
oof that's unfortunate they'll prob grow into it though? idk i wouldn't know heh	yeah hope so cuz i'm so clueless lmao
relatable but i'm sure you deserve more credit than you give yourself !	:oooo idrk about that i feel like a very underwhelming student rn
🤔 fr tho imposter syndrome is a thing	always eh i'm tryna get over it
yaya me too still feel like it's worth acknowledging tho? idk my last pset grades dropped yesterday and i tanked heh and my imposter syndrome came back woot	uh oh it's okay i think it's jus like hard to transition cuz all your hs you've probably been a high flyer
everyone here is so friggin SMART yeah lol	and it's just hard to
yeah exactly heh	find this like so hard idk i feel like that
i was reading a shit ton of stuff on imposter syndrome before i got to college cuz i was afraid of being depressed heh	oh really? do u feel like it was helpful
yeah i wanted to be prepared yeah	that's good
it helps guide my thoughts	hmm as long as u have the right mindset
but one line i remember is the article pointing out that we feel imposter syndrome because our success has become such a crucial part of our identity in high school and when our success is challenged we feel like we don't have a respectable identity anymore so i've spent college trying to rediscover my identity because of this heh aight that's my college rant thanks for coming to my ted talk	oh i see yeah ig your identity is kind of defined by that but there should be other things right yeah i think i get it
i think the yellowstone fpop and the camping fpop (leadership?) had people get the closest if thats your thing idk about advising i did one of the classes and it was fine i havent heard anyone say they loved or didnt like there advising really	Oh huh hmm Did u do an fpop
yeah i did the entrepreneurship one	Thats on campus right
Hey! Yes happy to give feedback, let me get back in touch with the recruitment directors so I can get notes from the other interviewer too Will get back to u within the next day or so	Awesome thanks so much
Alright so I think you did a good job in being conversational and showed strong critical thinking skills areas to improve upon are being creative, especially in qualitative questions, being organized in the math, and being clear when youre giving a final recommendation i would recommend a top down approach for the elevator pitch - start off with the recommendation, then give some brief justification	Oh okay I see Thanks for the feedback I'll work on this :))
Also we had a really small number of open spots this semester! so we had to turn down more people than usual	Haha yeah I figured it's all good tho Thanks for the opportunity!
Of course, best of luck with the semester!	Yeah you too! Are u graduating this spring?
ooops sorry for late reply okie sounds great ill put you guys down wait okay one thing i think since we get 5 ppl and i generally think its best that each committee get one rep would it be okay if just one of you guys was on the discord? this way it would be me for make+general techx, bryan for xfair+dev(and by weird extension general ops committees), one of you guys for hack, and one for projx one for think rip this upper limit is def not ideal but i think this is a pretty decent solution anyways def will note both of you guys down for the virtual midway thing happening on the 19th i think the midway should be fairly flexible tho since its techx handling the actual site haha actually wait just lmk if youre both available haha i realized im being presumptuous abt that fact	Yeah that's chill w me Yay yeah I can also send u a description of the event we're running Right I saw that yeah that's dope Not that this is related to midway Yeee we should be good Thanks Tiffanyy
Is this a separate cpw event? Aight coolio do you guys have a pref for whos on it Loll no prob feel free to poke me if you ever need anything	yeah like not related to midway just like hack usually does a cpw event so we modified it a bit
Yup gotcha	u can put jack on it he probably knows more about hack
Lmk logistics and description and ill include it into the midway website description for techx? Wait actually lmao i guess that only works if the event is after midway Wait jk that might not be true if the website is going up before the 19th Ok just ignore my rambling lmao and lmk what the deets are	"lol alright here it is: Slideshow Karaoke with HackMIT!
Friday, April 17th 9pm EDT

HackMIT is MIT's largest hackathon, held annually every fall for undergraduates around the world. For 24 hours, over 1,000 hackers gather on campus to experiment and innovate on cool software and hardware projects! Our 30-member organizing team is a close-knit group of undergraduates who put on HackMIT and Blueprint, a high school hackathon in the spring. 

Slideshow karaoke is an improv game where participants give presentations based on slides they've never seen before -- if you're interested in giving or seeing us give some *interesting* presentations, then come join us for some good vibes! website is poppin btw"
Thanks! This is cute haha Just one thing I think you should add some logistics abt like the platform youre hosting on? Gg virtual cpw is too much lmao but yeah anyways virtual location would be good to include Also have you guys submitted the form for this event yet?	oh yee it'll be on zoom and the cpw form said they'd send us the zoom link that would also be available to participants on their platform i'm not really sure i got an email about it today i'm still confused tho yee
"Lmao yeah everything is so complicated now haha Okkk great just fyi this is how i integrated the event description you gave me into our club description We are a student-run organization that aims to empower MIT students by bringing cutting-edge technology, new ideas, and top tech-innovators to campus. We run five major events and programs, HackMIT, xFair, MakeMIT, ProjX, and THINK. Our organization also depends on talented members taking charge and offering guidance in major operational roles, including Finance, Internal Relations, Marketing, and DevOps (which built the website you're reading this on!). 

HackMIT: Our 30-member organizing team is a close-knit group of undergraduates who put on HackMIT, MIT's largest hackathon for 1000+ students, and Blueprint, a high school hackathon in the spring. 
xFair: We organize MIT’s largest career fair and tech expo, showcasing interactive company demos and our very own MIT student projects.
MakeMIT: Our annual makeathon brings together hundreds of makers from around the country, providing them the resources to build absolutely anything over the course of 2 days.
ProjX: We provide funding and mentorship to student projects at MIT; projects then get a chance to demo their work at an expo at the end of each semester.
THINK: We run a competition where high school students from across the country compete for $1000 in seed funding, mentorship from the THINK team, and a trip to MIT.

If you'd like to meet some of our team and learn more us, make sure chat up the HackMIT team at CP* Slideshow Karaoke!
Time: Friday, April 17th 9pm EDT
Description: Slideshow karaoke is an improv game where participants give presentations based on slides they've never seen before -- if you're interested in giving or seeing us give some interesting presentations, then come join us for some good vibes! also didnt include event location bc its unclear atm haha but we should be able to edit stuff later so it should be okay for now"	that looks great thanks so muchhh

Hi Jaime! Mrs. Pohlonski referred me to you for a contact with Ally bank. MSU is starting their own chapter of HOSA and we are in search of sponsors. Mrs. P mentioned that you found a way to contact Ally after Drew Wells graduated and left instructions for the incoming officers. I would love help with that if possible!	Hey that's awesome sorry I didn't text u earlier im not home rn and haven't had service all day I'll be back on the 27th and can forward u the contact information if that works for u There wasn't much in particular to it but the contact I used the last two years was always very nice
Hi sorry! I'm not sure why I didn't receive a notification for your message. You can forward the information to me at kamindow@msu.edu Thank you so much! The email they have for sponsorships on their website doesn't really work so this will help us out alot	Hmm ok I'll forward t to u rn Oh wait acually I'll do this asap in the morning
Yeah no worries!	I just realized I can't rn
Wait idk why but the start judging button doesn't work for me I changed the logic a little bit and pushed it to my branch but idk if there was a reason you were doing it the other way...	oh lmao i just copy pasted that line but it was wrong because it's calling User.id lmao which doesn't exist it should work when replaced with Setting.key and key as the parameter but your way looks cleaner
Oh ok no worries Wait are you planning on storing the end time too? Becuase that would be nice :)	yeah i'm still working on the start judging button being changed to a stop judging button every click but yeah the end goal is to also store end_time
