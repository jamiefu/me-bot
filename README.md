# me-bot
Trained a Facebook chatbot to talk like me using my Facebook Messenger direct message data from June 2019 - June 2020. You can find it here: m.me/jmebot (Facebook app is still in dev mode, so it won't respond unless you're verified as a tester, but contact me at somewhere lol idk yet if you want to try it and I'll add you). 

Below are a few of the resources I used to create this:
- https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/seq2seq_translation_tutorial.html#loading-data-files
- https://adeshpande3.github.io/How-I-Used-Deep-Learning-to-Train-a-Chatbot-to-Talk-Like-Me
- https://github.com/adeshpande3/Facebook-Messenger-Bot/blob/master/index.js
- https://github.com/adeshpande3/Chatbot-Flask-Server/blob/master/app.py
